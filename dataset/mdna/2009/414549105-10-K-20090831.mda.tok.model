item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations note all amounts shown below are in thousands of us dollars  unless otherwise noted 
overview throughout fiscal  we have taken a number of steps that we believe are critical to our ability to restore revenue and profitability  including restructuring the company to better align our cost structure with expected revenue  by proactively taking the actions described below under restructuring and other charges  which took nearly  in annualized costs out of the business  approximately  on an annualized basis of which we anticipate will be re invested in talent during fiscal to support our key strategic initiatives  renegotiating our credit agreement to keep our term loans in place and provide a  line of credit to meet short term working capital needs  creating a new integrated research and selling organization that better serves our clients  forming global centers of excellence to better develop and deliver products and solutions into the marketplace  and continuing recruitment initiatives to attract top talent to augment the strong talent already at the company 
we believe it is likely that the unfavorable global macroeconomic conditions  which have negatively impacted our revenue and profitability during fiscal as described in more detail below  may continue to persist 
according to industry analysts at inside research  of market research buyers have faced cutbacks of their market research budgets in calendar  compared with only in calendar despite this outlook  we remain focused on continuing to implement our strategy to grow revenue and regain market share by capitalizing on our strong brand and leveraging the expertise and insights our client teams possess  all with an eye toward a sustaining future for harris 
goodwill impairment charges fiscal at september   we considered the incremental decline in our stock price from at june to at the end of september 
at that time  we concluded that this decline was short term 
table of contents in nature and absent factors to the contrary  did not trigger a review for impairment outside of our next scheduled annual impairment evaluation date  june  as part of our closing process for the three months ended december   we considered the following factors in determining whether an impairment review outside of our annual impairment evaluation date was necessary operating losses in our single reporting unit for the fiscal quarters ended september  and december   potential declines in market research spending for calendar year based on industry forecasts from inside research  headcount reductions and related charges as announced in october and december  the details of which are described in note  restructuring and other charges  to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k  a decline in our per share stock price from at september  to at december   which resulted in a market capitalization that  based on our per share stock price as of market close on december   was below the carrying value of our reporting unit s net assets at that date 
based on our consideration of the above noted factors  we concluded that an interim period goodwill impairment evaluation was necessary at december  accordingly  we performed the initial step of our impairment evaluation and determined that the carrying value of our single reporting unit s net assets exceeded their fair value 
the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis  which used a discount rate based on our best estimate of the after tax weighted average cost of capital  adjusted for the financial risk associated with our future operations 
in the second step of our impairment evaluation  we determined the implied fair value of goodwill and compared it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
the fair value of our reporting unit was allocated to all of its assets and liabilities as if it had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
this allocation resulted in no implied fair value of goodwill 
therefore  we recognized an impairment charge of  the remaining amount of our previously reported goodwill 
during the three months ended december   as a result of the factors discussed above  we also tested our asset groups for recoverability under sfas no 
as the projected undiscounted cash flows for the individual asset groups exceeded the carrying value of the long lived assets for each asset group  we did not record an impairment charge for any of our long lived assets during the three months ended december  no additional facts and circumstances arose during the remainder of fiscal to change this conclusion 
fiscal at march   we considered the decline in our stock price from january to march at that time  we concluded that the decline was short term in nature and did not trigger a review for impairment outside of our annual june impairment evaluation date 
at june   we performed the initial step of our impairment evaluation by comparing the fair market value of our single reporting unit  as determined using a discounted cash flow model  to its carrying value 
as the carrying amount exceeded the fair value  we performed the second step of our impairment evaluation to calculate impairment and as a result  recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of  the primary reason for the impairment charge was the sustained decline of our stock price during the second half of fiscal 
table of contents income tax valuation allowance during the second quarter of fiscal  our judgment regarding our us deferred tax assets changed  as the current macroeconomic environment and our us losses in the most recent three year period presented significant negative evidence such that a valuation allowance against our net us deferred tax assets was required 
accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance of  in the three months ended december  against the deferred tax assets of our us operations 
we will continue to assess the realizability of these deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
and will adjust the valuation allowance should all or a portion become realizable in the future 
restructuring and other charges restructuring fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we took actions to re align the cost structure of our us and us operations 
specifically  we reduced headcount at our us facilities by full time employees and announced plans to reduce headcount at our uk facilities by full time employees 
one time termination benefits associated with the us and us actions were  and  respectively  all of which involved cash payments 
these actions were communicated to the affected employees in march all actions were completed by march in the us and may in the us the related cash payments were completed by june in the uk and will be completed by march in the us at march   we reviewed the estimate of anticipated sublease rental income for our rochester  new york offices  located at corporate woods 
this review  prompted by adverse changes in real estate market conditions  resulted in a decrease to our estimate of the portion of the remaining lease obligation period over which we expect to derive sublease rental income 
this change in estimate resulted in a charge of in the third quarter of fiscal previously  during the second quarter of fiscal  we took actions to re align the cost structure of our us operations 
specifically  we reduced headcount at our us facilities by full time employees and incurred  in one time termination benefits  all of which involved cash payments 
the reductions in staff were communicated to the affected employees in october and december all actions were completed by december and we expect the related cash payments to be completed by december additionally during the second quarter of fiscal  we substantially vacated leased space at corporate woods 
we incurred in charges related to the remaining operating lease obligation  all of which involved cash payments 
all actions associated with this vacated space were completed by december we expect the related cash payments to be completed by june at december   we reviewed the estimates of anticipated sublease rental income for our grandville  mi and norwalk  ct offices  which were included in restructuring charges taken during the third quarter of fiscal in conjunction with our reduction of leased space at these facilities 
this review  prompted by adverse changes in real estate market conditions within each of these locales  resulted in a decrease to our estimate of the portion of the remaining lease obligation period over which we expect to derive sublease rental income 
this change in estimate resulted in a charge of for the three months ended december  restructuring charges for fiscal totaled  the headcount and leased space reductions described above took nearly  in annualized costs out of the business  approximately  on an annualized basis of which we anticipate will be re invested in talent during fiscal to support our key strategic initiatives 

table of contents fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we took certain actions designed to align the cost structure of our uk operations with the evolving operational needs of that business 
specifically  we reduced headcount at our uk facilities by full time employees and incurred in one time termination benefits  all of which involved cash payments 
the reduction in staff was communicated to the affected employees in june all actions were completed by july  and the related cash payments were completed in september the uk restructuring described above follows separate actions we took at various times during the fourth quarter of fiscal to strategically reduce headcount at several of our us facilities by a total of full time equivalents  as a result of which we incurred in one time termination benefits  all of which involved cash payments 
the reduction in staff was communicated to the affected employees in april additionally  we took steps to reduce costs associated with our us operations by reducing leased space at our cincinnati  ohio facility 
we incurred in contract termination charges related to the remaining operating lease obligation  all of which involved cash payments 
all actions associated with these headcount and leased space reductions were completed in april and may  respectively  and the related cash payments were completed in october and april  respectively 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded  in restructuring charges directly related to our decisions made at various times during the quarter to close our telephone center in orem  utah by march  strategically reduce headcount  and reduce leased space at our grandville  michigan and norwalk  connecticut offices 
each decision was designed to better align our cost structure with the evolving operational needs of the business 
in connection with the orem closure  we reduced our headcount by full time equivalents and incurred in one time termination benefits 
the reduction in staff was communicated to the affected employees in january additionally  we incurred in contract termination charges related to the remaining operating lease obligation 
all actions were completed by march  and involved cash payments  which were completed in august an additional headcount reduction of full time equivalents occurred in february and resulted in in one time termination benefits  all of which involved cash payments 
the reduction in staff was communicated to the affected employees in february all actions associated with this headcount reduction were completed in february  and cash payments in connection with the one time termination benefits were completed in september in connection with the leased space reductions in grandville and norwalk  we incurred in contract termination charges related to the remaining operating lease obligations  all of which involved cash payments 
all actions associated with the space reductions were completed in march cash payments in connection with the remaining lease obligations will be completed by april as a result of the actions described above  we realized approximately  in cash savings during fiscal and approximately  during fiscal fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded in restructuring charges directly related to a facilities consolidation and headcount reduction  both designed to ensure the alignment of our cost structure with the operational needs of the business 
we negotiated an amendment to the lease agreement for our reston  virginia office  terminating our lease with respect to a portion of our space in exchange for a payment of to the landlord  subject to conditions which have since been met 
as a result of the amendment  our lease obligation over the remaining term of the lease was reduced by approximately from the initial lease  which  when offset against the payment to the landlord for the space reduction noted above  resulted in anticipated net savings of approximately over the remaining lease term 

table of contents we also reduced the staff of our us operations by full time equivalents and incurred in severance charges  all of which involved cash payments 
the reduction in staff was communicated to the affected employees during the fourth quarter of fiscal all actions in the plan were completed by june  cash payments in connection with the plan were completed in december as a result of the actions described above  we realized cash savings of approximately in fiscal  consistent with our savings expectation at the time that these actions were taken 
other charges other charges totaled  and  for fiscal and  respectively  and included the following contractually obligated payments to former executives in connection with their departures during fiscal  gregory t 
novak  ronald e 
salluzzo and david b 
vaden became entitled to certain contractually obligated payments  all of which are cash payments 
these cash payments will be completed in december  december and february  respectively 
during fiscal  we incurred in severance charges for leonard r 
bayer  our former executive vice president  chief scientist and chief technology officer  in connection with his retirement  which was effective march  this amount was reclassified from the selling  general and administrative expense line in our consolidated statements of operations to conform to the current year presentation  as more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies reclassifications  to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
performance improvement consultant fees we retained a consulting firm to assist with performance improvement initiatives  bank negotiations and interim cfo services and incurred fees for services rendered during fiscal cost of reviewing strategic alternatives during fiscal  we incurred legal  accounting  banking and other costs in connection with a decision by our board of directors to investigate strategic alternatives available to the company 
after retaining an investment bank to assist with this process and considering the results of the investigations  the board determined that it was in the best interests of our stockholders to discontinue the process 
bank negotiation legal fees during fiscal  we incurred legal fees in connection with the negotiation of the amendments to our credit agreement 
other included in other is the bad debt expense for a note receivable  for which collectability has become doubtful  and recruitment fees for senior executives during fiscal further financial information about our restructuring plans and activities is included in note  restructuring and other charges  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the most significant of these areas involving difficult or complex judgments made by management with respect to the preparation of our financial statements in fiscal include revenue recognition  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  
table of contents stock based compensation  hipoints loyalty program  and contingencies and other accruals 
in each situation  management is required to make estimates about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from services on a proportional performance basis 
in assessing contract performance  both input and output criteria are reviewed 
costs incurred are used as an objective input measure of performance 
the primary input of all work performed under these arrangements is labor 
as a result of the relationship between labor and cost  there is normally a direct relationship between the costs incurred and the proportion of the contract performed to date 
costs incurred as an initial proportion of expected total costs is used as an initial proportional performance measure 
this indicative proportional performance measure is always subsequently validated against more subjective criteria ie relevant output measures such as the percentage of interviews completed  percentage of reports delivered to a client and the achievement of any project milestones stipulated in the contract 
in the event of divergence between the objective and more subjective measures  the more subjective measures take precedence since these are output measures 
clients are obligated to pay based upon services performed  and in the event that a client cancels the contract  the client is responsible for payment for services performed through the date of cancellation 
losses expected to be incurred  if any  on jobs in progress are charged to income as soon as it becomes probable that such losses will occur 
invoices to clients in the ordinary course are generated based upon the achievement of specific events  as defined by each contract  including deliverables  timetables  and incurrence of certain costs 
such events may not be directly related to the performance of services 
revenues earned on contracts in progress in excess of billings are classified as unbilled receivables 
amounts billed in excess of revenues earned are classified as deferred revenue 
revisions to estimated costs and differences between actual contract losses and estimated contract losses would affect both the timing of revenue allocated and the results of our operations 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances  and to write down goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets when impaired 
the evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis 
these assessments require us to estimate the fair market value of our single reporting unit 
if we determine that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  absent other facts to the contrary  we must recognize an impairment charge for the associated goodwill of the reporting unit against earnings in our consolidated financial statements 
as we have one reportable segment  we utilize the entity wide approach for assessing goodwill 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and 
table of contents significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting unit and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting this valuation  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty  and as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment using the two step process as prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  a second step must be followed to calculate impairment 
otherwise  if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  the goodwill is not considered to be impaired as of the measurement date 
to determine fair value for our reporting unit  we use the fair value of the cash flows that the reporting unit can be expected to generate in the future 
this valuation method requires management to project revenues  operating expenses  working capital investment  capital spending and cash flows for our reporting unit over a multiyear period  as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate 
significant management judgment is involved in preparing these estimates 
changes in projections or estimates could significantly change the estimated fair value of our reporting unit and affect the recorded balance of goodwill 
in addition  if management uses different assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different than those anticipated  future operating results and the balance of goodwill in the future could be affected by impairment charges 
impairment of long lived assets we account for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in the projected revenues and expenses  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
a test for recoverability also is performed when we have committed to a plan to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset group and the plan is expected to be completed within a year 
recoverability of an asset group is evaluated by comparing its carrying value to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the comparison indicates that the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized 
the impairment loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the estimated fair value 
when an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used  the adjusted carrying amount of those assets is depreciated over its remaining useful life 
restoration of a previously recognized long lived asset impairment loss is not allowed 
we estimate the fair value of an asset group based on market prices ie  the amount for which the asset could be bought by or sold to a third party  when available 
when market prices are not available  we estimate the fair value of the asset group using the income approach and or the market approach 
the income approach uses cash flow projections 
inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  approved business plans  expected growth rates and cost of capital  among others 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions  interest rates  and other market data 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods 
changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of fair value of an asset group  and therefore could affect the amount of potential impairment of the asset 
the following assumptions are key to our income approach business projections we make assumptions about the level of demand for our services in the marketplace 
these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for revenue growth 
we also make assumptions about our cost levels 
these assumptions are key inputs for developing our cash flow projections 
these projections are derived using our internal business plans 

table of contents growth rate the growth rate is the expected rate at which an asset group s earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the planning period 
economic projections assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding revenue from services 
these macroeconomic assumptions include inflation  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to operating loss carryforwards and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases for operating profit and tax liability carryforward 
sfas no 
requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of the available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
the decision to record a valuation allowance requires varying degrees of judgment based upon the nature of the item giving rise to the deferred tax asset 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is based on significant estimates  and it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates in the near term could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
on july   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
although we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters 
we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made 
our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties 
stock based compensation on july   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the recognition of compensation expense for all share based payments made to employees based on the fair value of the share based payment on the date of grant 
we elected to use the modified prospective approach for adoption  which requires that compensation expense be recorded for the unvested portion of previously issued awards that remain outstanding at july  using the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same attribution method used to determine the pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
for share based payments granted subsequent to july   compensation expense based on the grant date fair value is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations over the requisite 
table of contents service period 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which employs the following assumptions expected volatility based on historical volatilities from daily share price observations for our stock covering a period commensurate with the expected term of the options granted 
expected life of the option based on the vesting terms of the respective option and a contractual life of ten years  calculated using the simplified method as allowed by staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
risk free rate based on the implied yield available at the time the options were granted on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option when granted 
dividend yield based on our historical practice of electing not to pay dividends to our shareholders 
expected volatility and the expected life of the options granted  both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes option pricing model  involve management s best estimates at that time 
the weighted average assumptions used to value options during the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  are set forth in note  stock based compensation  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
the fair value of our restricted stock awards is based on the price per share of our common stock on the date of grant 
we grant options to purchase our stock at fair value as of the date of grant 
sfas no 
r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options or restricted shares that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior and the vesting period of the respective stock options or restricted shares 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
hipoints loyalty program in july  we initiated hipoints  a loyalty program designed to reward respondents who register for our online panel  complete online surveys and refer others to join our online panel 
the earned points are non transferable and may be redeemed for gifts from a specific product folio at any time prior to expiration 
we maintain a reserve for our obligations with respect to future redemption of outstanding points based on the expected redemption rate of the points 
this expected redemption rate is based on our actual redemption rates since the inception of the program 
an actual redemption rate that differs from the expected redemption rate could have a material impact on our results of operations 
prior to december  points under the hipoints program expired after one year of account inactivity 
in december  we modified the expiration parameters of the program such that points now expire after nine months of account inactivity and tightened the rules around expirations to more accurately account for panelists that are not truly engaged in the program 
these changes resulted in an approximately reduction in our reserve for obligations with respect to future redemption of outstanding points during the second quarter of fiscal  which was recorded in the cost of services line of our consolidated statement of operations 
contingencies and other accruals from time to time  we record accruals for severance costs both in connection with formal restructuring programs and in the normal course  lease costs associated with excess facilities  contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of actions we undertake to streamline our organization  reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs 
estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions  such as future lease payments  sublease income  the fair value of 
table of contents assets  and severance and related benefits  are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated 
to the extent actual costs differ from those estimates  reserve levels may need to be adjusted 
in addition  these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such actions were approved 
additionally  we record accruals for estimated incentive compensation costs during each year 
amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not finally determinable until the completion of our fiscal year end closing process 
explanation of key financial statement captions revenue from services we recognize revenue from services on a proportional performance basis  as more particularly described above in critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
our revenue from services is derived principally from the following custom research including  but not limited to  customer satisfaction surveys  market share studies  new product introduction studies  brand recognition studies  reputation studies and ad concept testing 
tracking studies studies that regularly ask identical questions to similar demographic groups within a constant interval once a month  once a quarter  etc 
to feed business decision makers with dynamic data and intelligence 
service bureau research hisb provides data collection services primarily for other market research firms 
cost of services our direct costs associated with generating revenues principally consist of the following items project personnel project personnel have four distinct roles project management  survey design  data collection  and data analysis 
we maintain project personnel in north america  europe  and asia 
labor costs are specifically allocated to the projects they relate to 
we utilize a timekeeping system  which tracks the time of project personnel as incurred for each specific revenue generating project 
panelist incentives our panelists receive both cash and non cash incentives through programs such as our hipoints loyalty program for participating in our surveys 
we award cash incentives to our panelists for participating in surveys  which are earned when we receive a timely and complete survey response 
non cash incentives in the form of points are awarded to market survey respondents who register for our online panel  complete online surveys and refer others to join our online panel 
the earned points are non transferable and may be redeemed for gifts from a specific product folio at any time prior to their expiration 
data processing we manage the processing of survey data using our own employees 
we also engage third party suppliers to perform data processing on an as needed basis 
other direct costs other direct costs include direct purchases  principally labor and materials  related to data collection and analysis  and the amortization of software developed for internal use 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense includes the following payroll and related costs  including commissions  for sales and marketing professionals  
table of contents payroll and related costs for staff in the areas of finance  human resources  information technology and executive management  and other indirect costs necessary to support the business  including among others  office rents  travel  stock based compensation and public company costs 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes includes current and deferred income taxes 
furthermore  deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected realization of available net operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is necessary to reduce a deferred tax asset to an amount that we expect to realize in the future 
we continually review the adequacy of our valuation allowance and adjust it based on whether or not our assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that these benefits will be realized 
results of operations the following table sets forth the results of our continuing operations  expressed both as a dollar amount and as a percentage of revenue from services  for the fiscal years ended june revenue from services operating expenses cost of services selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization gain on sale of assets restructuring and other charges goodwill impairment charge operating income loss interest and other income interest expense income loss from continuing operations before taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss the results of continuing operations as presented and discussed herein do not include the results of our discontinued rent and recruit business

fiscal year ended june  versus fiscal year ended june  revenue from services 
revenue from services decreased by  or  to  for fiscal compared with fiscal as more fully described below  revenue from services was

on a local currency basis  uk revenue decreased by compared with fiscal revenue from french operations of  up compared with  for fiscal french revenue for fiscal included a negative foreign exchange rate impact compared with fiscal on a local currency basis  french revenue increased by compared with fiscal the increase in french revenue was principally driven by growth within the healthcare and consumer research groups 
revenue from german operations of  down compared with  for fiscal german revenue for fiscal included a negative foreign exchange rate impact compared with fiscal on a local currency basis  german revenue decreased by compared with fiscal the decrease in german revenue was principally driven by decreases in the research budgets at several of our german unit s key clients 
asian revenue increased by  to  for fiscal  an increase of compared with fiscal the increase was principally impacted by increased focus on driving business with clients in the pharmaceutical  telecommunications and hotel industries 
the impact of the foreign exchange rate on asian revenue was inconsequential compared with fiscal cost of services 
cost of services was  or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with  or of total revenue for fiscal cost of services was impacted by the declines in revenue discussed above  the headcount reductions taken throughout fiscal  as more fully described above under restructuring and other charges  and the differing types of custom research projects performed in fiscal compared with fiscal cost of services as a percentage of revenue for fiscal was greater than fiscal given the pace of the declines in revenue relative to the timing of our cost reductions 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal was  or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with  or of total 
table of contents revenue for fiscal selling  general and administrative expense was principally impacted by the following a  decrease in payroll related expense  driven by headcount reductions taken throughout this fiscal year  a  decrease in stock based compensation expense  driven by the departures of several senior executives from the prior management team throughout this fiscal year  a  decrease in travel expense  driven by our continued focus on controlling these costs  and a decrease in office rent  driven by space reductions taken during fiscal and the remainder of the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense was the result of decreases across a number of other operating expense categories because of our continued focus on ensuring appropriate alignment of our cost structure relative to the needs of our business 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was  or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with  or of total revenue for fiscal the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense when compared with fiscal was the result of fixed and intangible assets that became fully depreciated or amortized during fiscal combined with decreased capital spending during fiscal as part of our overall focus on controlling costs 
restructuring and other charges

see above under goodwill impairment charges for a discussion of the goodwill impairment charges incurred during fiscal and interest and other income 
interest and other income was or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with  or of total revenue for fiscal the decrease in interest and other income was principally the result of having a lower average cash balance and lower rate of return for fiscal when compared with fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was  or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with  or of total revenue for fiscal the increase in interest expense was principally the result of a  charge recorded during fiscal to reflect the ineffectiveness of our interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge during the second and third quarters of fiscal  along with an increase in the applicable spread under our credit facilities from to  each as a result of the covenant violations and subsequent waivers and amendments to our credit agreement described below under liquidity and capital resources credit facilities 
income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of  for fiscal  compared with an income tax benefit of for fiscal the tax provision for fiscal was principally impacted by the valuation allowance recorded against our us deferred tax assets  as discussed above under income taxes and the tax non deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge described above under goodwill impairment charges 
fiscal year ended june  versus fiscal year ended june  revenue from services 
revenue from services increased by  to  for fiscal  an increase of over fiscal revenue from services was impacted by several factors  as more fully described below 

table of contents north american revenue increased by  to  for fiscal  an increase of over fiscal for fiscal  north american revenue was comprised of  from us operations  down compared with  for fiscal the decrease in us revenue was impacted by revenue declines in the following industry groups healthcare  as a result of budget cuts in the pharmaceutical industry as well as the replacement of industry team leadership  and emerging and general markets  as a result of this group s transition to new sales leadership during the fiscal year 
 from canadian operations  all of which was attributable to our august acquisition of decima 
european revenue increased by  to  for fiscal  an increase of over fiscal for fiscal  european revenue was comprised of  from our uk operations  essentially flat when compared with  for fiscal  and  from our french and german operations  compared with  from those operations for fiscal the increase in revenue from these operations was principally the result of our april acquisition of mediatransfer  which contributed  in incremental revenue in fiscal european revenue for fiscal included a favorable impact of  as a result of foreign exchange rate differences and the depreciation of the us dollar against the british pound and the euro 
cost of services 
cost of services was  or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with  or of total revenue for fiscal cost of services was principally impacted by the increase in revenue from services discussed above  as well as the differing types of custom research projects performed in fiscal compared with fiscal additionally  cost of services was favorably impacted by the reduction in our reserve for obligations with respect to future redemption of outstanding points under our hipoints program discussed above

gain on sale of assets 
there were no gains on the sale of assets for fiscal gain on sale of assets during fiscal consisted of a gain realized on the december sale of our stockport facility  along with in net proceeds from the june sale of two internally developed patents 
restructuring and other charges 
see above under restructuring and other charges for a discussion of restructuring charges incurred during fiscal and goodwill impairment charge 
see above under goodwill impairment charges for a discussion of the goodwill impairment charge incurred during fiscal interest and other income 
interest and other income was  or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with  or of total revenue for fiscal the decrease in interest 
table of contents and other income was due to a decrease in the average balance of cash and marketable securities for fiscal when compared with fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was  or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with or of total revenue for fiscal the increase in interest expense was the result of our outstanding debt in fiscal compared with fiscal  during which we did not have any outstanding debt for the first nine months of the fiscal year 
the debt incurred was used to fund a portion of the consideration for our mediatransfer acquisition in fiscal  and our decima and marketshare acquisitions in fiscal income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit from continuing operations of for fiscal  compared with an income tax provision of  for fiscal this was principally impacted by a  tax charge which resulted from the goodwill impairment charge discussed above  which was largely non deductible for tax purposes

significant factors affecting company performance our revenue mix in reports filed with the sec for periods prior to the fiscal quarter ended december   in addition to reporting revenue from services  we provided detail as to the portion of revenue that was internet based 
we treated all of the revenue from a project as internet based whenever more than of the data collection for that project was completed online 
during the periods in which we were one of the few providers of internet based market research  an understanding of internet based revenue was helpful in understanding the speed of conversion of clients to the internet and our growth prospects 
costs related to internet data collection also are different than those related to traditional methods of data collection  so an understanding of our internet based revenue was helpful in comparing our margins with those of others in the market research industry 
internet based research now has gained wide market acceptance  both with providers and clients  and is less a differentiating factor for us than it historically was 
moreover  the percentage of our revenue in the united states that is internet based has stabilized within a range of of total us revenue during the most recent fiscal years  and the percentage of our revenue generated in europe has grown to be within a similar range 
rather than focusing on internet based revenue growth  our current business model emphasizes utilizing the most efficient and effective data collection method for the specific project  whether internet based  traditional  or otherwise 
therefore  we no longer believe that separate reporting of internet based revenue provides materially helpful information to investors  and discontinued separate reporting of that metric for periods after december  our ability to measure our performance we closely track certain key operating metrics  specifically bookings and ending sales backlog 
these key operating metrics enable us to measure the current and forecasted performance of our business relative to historical trends 
in prior periods  we have also reported days of sales outstanding  utilization and average billable full time equivalents 
we are no longer reporting these metrics and have limited the metrics reported below to those that we believe are most useful to investors in tracking trends within our business 

table of contents key operating metrics for continuing operations  by quarter  for the fiscal years ended june  and  were as follows us dollar amounts in millions q q q q q q q q fy fy fy fy fy fy fy fy cash marketable securities bookings ending sales backlog additional information regarding each of the key operating metrics noted above is as follows bookings are defined as the contract value of revenue generating projects that are anticipated to take place during the next four fiscal quarters for which a firm client commitment was received during the current period  less any adjustments to prior period bookings due to contract value adjustments or project cancellations during the current period 
bookings for the three months ended june  were million  compared with million for the same prior year period 
the decrease in bookings was principally impacted by the challenging global macroeconomic conditions discussed above under risks related to our business 
monitoring bookings enhances our ability to forecast long term revenue and to measure the effectiveness of our marketing and sales initiatives 
however  we also are mindful that bookings often vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
information concerning our new bookings is not comparable to  nor should it be substituted for  an analysis of our revenue over time 
there are no third party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings 
new bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts and renewals  as well as extensions and additions to existing contracts 
subsequent cancellations  extensions and other matters may affect the amount of bookings previously reported 
ending sales backlog is defined as prior period ending sales backlog plus current period bookings  less revenue recognized on outstanding projects as of the end of the period 
ending sales backlog helps us manage our future staffing levels more accurately and is also an indicator of the effectiveness of our marketing and sales initiatives 
generally  projects included in ending sales backlog at the end of a fiscal period convert to revenue from services during the following twelve months  based on our experience from prior years 
however  it is unclear what effect current global macroeconomic conditions will have on the conversion of backlog to revenue over the next few quarters  as projects currently in backlog remain subject to cancellation if the project has not already commenced 
ending sales backlog for the three months ended june  was million  compared with million for the same prior year period 
the decrease in ending sales backlog was principally impacted by the challenging global macroeconomic conditions discussed above under risks related to our business 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents the following table sets forth net cash provided by used in operating activities  net cash provided by used in investing activities and net cash provided by used in financing activities  for the fiscal years ended june net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities 
table of contents net cash provided by used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was  for fiscal  compared with  provided by operating activities for fiscal the change from fiscal was principally the result of our net loss for fiscal and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  many of which are project related and were impacted by current fiscal year revenue declines  partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and unbilled receivables 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to  for fiscal  compared with  for fiscal the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of the cash contributed from the operations of mediatransfer  decima and marketshare 
net cash provided by used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was  for fiscal  compared with  for fiscal this change was principally the result of having no cash outlay for acquisitions during fiscal  compared with  used during fiscal for acquisitions  and  in net purchases of marketable securities during the fiscal  compared with net proceeds from the maturities and sales of marketable securities of  for fiscal net cash used in investing activities was  for fiscal  compared with  in net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal when compared with fiscal  this change was principally the result of  in net cash used for acquisitions  compared with  used in fiscal  along with a decline in net proceeds generated from maturities and sales of marketable securities from  in fiscal to  in fiscal net cash provided by used in financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was  for fiscal  compared with  provided by financing activities for fiscal this change was partially the result of having no borrowings during fiscal  compared with  in net borrowings for fiscal  and a  decrease in repayments of outstanding borrowings for fiscal when compared with fiscal in addition  fiscal included  in cash used to pay the costs associated with the amendments to our credit agreement discussed below under credit facilities 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for fiscal  compared with  used in financing activities for fiscal this change was the result of  in net proceeds from borrowings  which were used to fund a portion of the consideration for our acquisitions of decima and marketshare  partially offset by  in payments on outstanding borrowings 
comparatively   was used during fiscal to fund repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program  which expired on december  the share repurchase program was not renewed  and no purchases were made under it after fiscal working capital at june   we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of  compared with  at june  available sources of cash to support known or reasonably likely cash requirements over the next months include cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at june  additional cash that may be generated from our operations and funds to the extent available through our credit facilities discussed below 
until we achieve leverage ratios specified in our amended credit facility  we must have minimum cash balances ranging between and times the amount of borrowings we make under the revolving line that is part of our amended credit facilities 
while we believe that our available sources of cash will support known or reasonably likely cash requirements over the next months  our ability to generate cash from our operations is dependent upon the factors discussed below 
generating cash from our operations significantly depends on our ability to profitably generate revenue  which requires that we continually develop new business  both for growth and to replace completed projects 
although work for no one client constitutes more than of our revenue  we 
table of contents have had to find significant amounts of replacement and additional revenue as client relationships and work for continuing clients change and will likely have to continue to do so in the future 
our ability to generate revenue depends not only on execution of our business plans  but also on general market factors outside of our control 
as many of our clients treat all or a portion of their market research expenditures as discretionary  our ability to generate revenue is adversely impacted whenever there are adverse macroeconomic conditions in the markets we serve 
as discussed above under risks related to our business  the adverse global macroeconomic environment has significantly impacted our operations during fiscal industry analysts at inside research have indicated that these trends may continue to persist  given the expected decrease in market research spending described above under overview 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including but not limited to  market acceptance of our services  the resources we allocate to the continuing development of new products and services  our technology infrastructure and online panel  and the marketing and selling of our services 
our capital expenditures are not expected to exceed  for fiscal credit facilities on september   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na jpmorgan  as administrative agent  and the lenders party thereto  pursuant to which the lenders made available certain credit facilities 
as of december   we were in violation of the leverage and interest coverage covenants under the terms of the credit agreement 
we obtained a day waiver of the covenant violations from the lenders on february   and in connection with the waiver  the credit agreement was amended the first amendment 
we obtained an additional day extension of the waiver on march   and in connection with the waiver  the credit agreement was further amended in immaterial respects 
on may  and effective as of that date  we entered into a further amendment the second amendment to the credit agreement  pursuant to which the prior covenant defaults were permanently waived and we were again in compliance with the terms of the credit agreement  as amended

at june   we did not have any amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit 
interest rate swap effective september   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with jpmorgan  which effectively fixed the floating libor interest portion of the rates on the amounts outstanding under term loans a and b including as term loans b and c were consolidated into term loan b at through september  the three month libor rate received on the swap matches the base rate paid on the term loan since both use three month libor 
the swap had an initial notional value of  which declines as payments are made on term loans a and b so that the amount outstanding under those term loans and the notional amount of the swap are always equal 
the interest rate swap had a notional amount of  at june   which was the same as the outstanding amount of the term loans 
the applicable spreads referenced in the table above are added to the rate fixed by the interest rate swap 
the terms of the interest rate swap remain unaffected by the first or second amendments 
the interest rate swap continues to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
at june   we recorded a liability of  in the other liabilities line item of our unaudited consolidated balance sheet to reflect the fair value of the interest rate swap 
as a result of the covenant violations noted above  it was determined that the interest rate swap was not an effective cash flow hedge at both december  and march  accordingly  we recorded charges to interest expense to reflect the ineffectiveness of the swap of  during the second and third quarters of fiscal at may   the swap was once again deemed an effective cash flow hedge  and continued to be effective at june  as such  changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were once again recorded through other comprehensive income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have two kinds of market risk exposures  interest rate exposure and foreign currency exposure 
we have no market risk sensitive instruments entered into for trading purposes 
in light of recent economic conditions  we reviewed the cash equivalents and marketable securities held by us 
we do not believe that our holdings have a material liquidity risk under current market conditions 
interest rate exposure at june   we had outstanding debt under our credit facilities of  the debt matures september  and bears interest at the floating adjusted libor plus an applicable margin 
on september   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which fixed the floating adjusted libor portion of the interest rate at through september  the 
table of contents additional applicable margin was fixed at four percentage points in the first amendment and five percentage points in the second amendment 
the terms of the interest rate swap remain unchanged by the first or second amendments 
using a sensitivity analysis based on a hypothetical increase in prevailing interest rates over a month period  each increase from prevailing interest rates at june  would have increased the fair value of the interest rate swap by and each decrease from prevailing interest rates at june  would have decreased the fair value of the interest rate swap by foreign currency exposure as a result of operating in foreign markets  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have international sales and operations in europe  north america  and asia 
therefore  we are subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
non us transactions are denominated in the functional currencies of the respective countries in which our foreign subsidiaries reside 
our consolidated assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date 
consolidated income and expense items are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates for each period presented 
accumulated net translation adjustments are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
we measure our risk related to foreign currency rate exposure on two levels  the first being the impact of operating results on the consolidation of foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in the functional currency of their home country  and the second being the extent to which we have instruments denominated in a foreign currency 
foreign exchange translation gains and losses are included in our results of operations as a result of consolidating the results of our international operations  which are denominated in each country s functional currency  with our us results 
the impact of translation gains or losses on net income from consolidating foreign subsidiaries was not material for the periods presented 
we have historically had low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates upon consolidating the results of our foreign subsidiaries with our us results  due to the size of our foreign operations in comparison to our consolidated operations 
however  if the operating profits of our international operations increase  our exposure to the appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar could have a more significant impact on our net income and cash flows 
thus  we evaluate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation risk on an ongoing basis 
since our foreign operations are conducted using a foreign currency  we bear additional risk of fluctuations in exchange rates because of instruments denominated in a foreign currency 
we have historically had low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates with regard to instruments denominated in a foreign currency  given the amount and short term nature of the maturity of these instruments 
the carrying values of financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency  including cash  cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable  approximate fair value because of the short term nature of the maturity of these instruments 
we performed a sensitivity analysis at june  holding all other variables constant  we have determined that the impact of a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows
