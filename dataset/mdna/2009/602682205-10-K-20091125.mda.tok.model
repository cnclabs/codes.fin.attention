table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  develop and sell semiconductor solutions for communications applications in the wireline and wireless network infrastructure  which includes today s separate but interrelated and converging enterprise  broadband access  metropolitan and wide area networks 
our products are classified into three focused product families 
our multiservice access dsp products include ultra low power multi core dsp system on a chip products for carrier class triple play edge gateways  metro trunking gateways and voice over ip voip and multi play service platforms in the carrier infrastructure 
our products are also used in broadband customer premises equipment gateways and other equipment that carriers are deploying in order to deliver voice  data and video services to residential subscribers 
our high performance analog hpa products  including high density crosspoint switches  optical drivers and other devices  plus timing  equalization and signal conditioning solutions for next generation fiber access networks including ethernet passive optical networking equipment 
our hpa technology also helps address switching  timing and signal conditioning challenges being used in enterprise storage equipment  and is helping to drive the broadcast video network transition to g high definition transmission 
our wide area networks wan communications products  which include a broad portfolio for legacy requirements in the existing circuit switched network  as well as emerging g wireless backhaul applications 
our products are sold to oems for use in a variety of network infrastructure equipment  including voice and media gateways  high speed routers  switches  access multiplexers  cross connect systems  add drop multiplexers  digital loop carrier equipment  ip private branch exchanges  optical modules  broadcast video systems and wireless base station equipment 
service providers use this equipment for packet processing in high speed multi service access applications including advanced voip and triple play voice  data and video service delivery  high speed analog transmission and switching for next generation optical networking  enterprise storage and broadcast video transmission applications with difficult switching  timing and synchronization requirements  and wan communications over the public switched telephone network  which furnishes much of the internet s underlying long distance infrastructure 
our customers include alcatel lucent  cisco systems  inc  huawei technologies co 
ltd  lm ericsson telephone company  nokia siemens networks  nortel networks  inc and zhongxing telecom equipment corp 
trends and factors affecting our business our products are components of network infrastructure equipment 
as a result  we rely on network infrastructure oems to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment 
these design wins are an integral part of the long sales cycle for our products 
our customers may need six months or longer to test and evaluate our products and an additional six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our products 
we believe our close relationships with leading network infrastructure oems facilitate early adoption of our products during development of their products  enhance our ability to obtain design wins and encourage adoption of our technology by the industry 
we believe our diverse portfolio of semiconductor solutions has us well positioned to capitalize on some of the most significant trends in telecommunications spending  including next generation network convergence  voip fiber access deployment in developing and developed markets  g wireless infrastructure build out  and the migration of broadcast video to high definition 
we market and sell our semiconductor products directly to network infrastructure oems 
we also sell our products indirectly through electronic component distributors and third party electronic manufacturing service providers  who manufacture products incorporating our semiconductor networking solutions for oems 
sales to distributors accounted for approximately of our revenues for fiscal our revenue is well diversified globally  with of fiscal revenue coming from outside of the americas 
we believe a portion of the products we sell to oems and third party manufacturing service providers in the asia pacific region is ultimately shipped to end markets in the americas and europe 
we are particularly leveraged in china  where fiber deployments are being rolled out by the country s major telecommunications carriers 
through our oem 
table of contents customers  we have started shipping into the fiber to the building fttb deployments of china telecom and china unicom 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  of our revenue was derived from china 
we have significant research  development  engineering and product design capabilities 
our success depends to a substantial degree upon our ability to develop and introduce in a timely fashion new products and enhancements to our existing products that meet changing customer requirements and emerging industry standards 
we have made  and plan to make  substantial investments in research and development and to participate in the formulation of industry standards 
we spent approximately million on research and development in fiscal we seek to maximize our return on our research and development spending by focusing our research and development investment in what we believe are key growth markets  including voip and other high bandwidth multi service access applications  plus high performance analog applications  such as optical networking and broadcast video transmission  and wireless infrastructure solutions for base station processing and backhaul applications 
we have developed and maintain a broad intellectual property portfolio  and we intend to periodically enter into strategic arrangements to leverage our portfolio by licensing or selling our patents 
we recognized our first revenues from the sale of patents during the fourth quarter of fiscal and continued to recognize patent related revenues in fiscal we anticipate continuing this intellectual property strategy in future periods 
we are dependent upon third parties for the development  manufacturing  assembly and testing of our products 
our ability to bring new products to market  to fulfill orders and to achieve long term revenue growth is dependent on our ability to obtain sufficient external manufacturing capacity  including wafer fabrication capacity 
periods of upturn in the semiconductor industry may be characterized by rapid increases in demand and a shortage of capacity for wafer fabrication and assembly and test services 
in such periods  we may experience longer lead times or indeterminate delivery schedules  which may adversely affect our ability to fulfill orders for our products 
during periods of capacity shortages for manufacturing  assembly and testing services  our primary foundries and other suppliers may devote their limited capacity to fulfill the requirements of other clients that are larger than we are  or who have superior contractual rights to enforce manufacture of their products  including to the exclusion of producing our products 
we may also incur increased manufacturing costs  including costs of finding acceptable alternative foundries or assembly and test service providers 
in order to achieve sustained profitability and positive cash flows from operations  we may need to further reduce operating expenses and or increase our revenues 
we have completed a series of cost reduction actions which have improved our operating cost structure  and we will continue to perform additional actions  when necessary 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we announced a new restructuring plan 
we anticipate incurring special charges of between approximately  and million dollars during the first quarter of fiscal  associated with a facilities consolidation as well as severance costs for affected employees 
we expect to realize the full benefit of these reductions beginning in the fiscal second quarter 
however  we intend to reinvest substantially all of such cost savings back into our research and development programs 
consequently  we do not expect that the restructuring plan will result in a long term reduction in our operating expenses 
our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend on increased demand for network infrastructure equipment that incorporates our products  which in turn depends primarily on the level of capital spending by communications service providers the level of which may decrease due to general economic conditions and uncertainty  over which we have no control 
we believe the market for network infrastructure equipment in general  and for communications semiconductors in particular  offers attractive long term growth prospects due to increasing demand for network capacity  the continued upgrading and expansion of existing networks and the build out of telecommunication networks in developing countries 
however  the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving technical standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
in addition  there has been an increasing trend toward industry consolidation  particularly among major network equipment and telecommunications companies 
consolidation in the industry may lead to pricing pressure and loss of market share 
these factors have caused substantial fluctuations in our revenues and our results of operations in the past  and we may experience cyclical fluctuations in our business in the future 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
among the significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements are those relating to inventories  revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  income taxes and impairment of long lived assets 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
inventories we assess the recoverability of our inventories at least quarterly through a review of inventory levels in relation to foreseeable demand generally over months 
foreseeable demand is based upon all available information  including sales backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycles 
when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand  we write down the value of those inventories which  at the time of our review  we expect to be unable to sell 
the amount of the inventory write down is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory 
our products are used by oems that have designed our products into network infrastructure equipment 
for many of our products  we gain these design wins through a lengthy sales cycle  which often includes providing technical support to the oem customer 
in the event of the loss of business from existing oem customers  we may be unable to secure new customers for our existing products without first achieving new design wins 
when the quantities of inventory on hand exceed foreseeable demand from existing oem customers into whose products our products have been designed  we generally will be unable to sell our excess inventories to others  and the estimated realizable value of such inventories to us is generally zero 
we base our assessment of the recoverability of our inventories  and the amounts of any write downs  on currently available information and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management 
in the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation transactions using a fair value method and recognize the fair value of each award as an expense over the service period 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based upon the market price of our common stock at the grant date 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards  as of the grant date  using the black scholes option pricing model 
the use of the black scholes model requires that we make a number of estimates  including the expected option term  the expected volatility in the price of our common stock  the risk free rate of interest and the dividend yield on our common stock 
if our expected option term and stock price volatility assumptions were different  the resulting determination of the fair value of stock option awards could be materially different 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the number of share based awards that we expect will ultimately vest upon the fulfillment of service conditions such as time based vesting or the achievement of specific performance conditions 
if the actual number of awards that ultimately vest differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
we classify compensation expense related to these awards in our consolidated statement of operations based on the department to which the recipient reports 
revenue recognition our products are often integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of the equipment 
additionally  we provide unspecified software upgrades and enhancements through our maintenance contracts for many of our products 
accordingly  we account for revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification  software revenue recognition  or asc  and all related interpretations 
for sales of products where software not included or is incidental to the equipment  we apply the provisions of accounting standards codification  revenue recognition  or asc  and all related interpretations 

table of contents we generate revenues from direct product sales  sales to distributors  maintenance contracts  development agreements and the sale and license of intellectual property 
we recognize revenues when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii our price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of the sales price is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product  system  or solution is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
technical support services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
advanced services revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance 
we recognize revenues on products shipped directly to customers at the time the products are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  in accordance with the terms specified in the arrangement  and the four above mentioned revenue recognition criteria are met 
we recognize revenues on sales to distributors based on the rights granted to these distributors in our distribution agreements 
we have certain distributors who have been granted return rights and receive credits for changes in selling prices to end customers  the magnitude of which is not known at the time products are shipped to the distributor 
the return rights granted to these distributors consist of limited stock rotation rights  which allow them to rotate up to of the products in their inventory twice a year  as well as certain product return rights if the applicable distribution agreement is terminated 
these distributors also receive price concessions because they resell our products to end customers at various negotiated price points which vary by end customer  product  quantity  geography and competitive pricing environments 
when a distributor s resale is priced at a discount from the distributor s invoice price  we credit back to the distributor a portion of the distributor s original purchase price after the resale transaction is complete 
thus  a portion of the deferred income on sales to distributors balance will be credited back to the distributor in the future 
under these agreements  we defer recognition of revenue until the products are resold by the distributor  at which time our final net sales price is fixed and the distributor s right to return the products expires 
at the time of shipment to these distributors  i we record a trade receivable at the invoiced selling price because there is a legally enforceable obligation from the distributor to pay us currently for product delivered  ii we relieve inventory for the carrying value of products shipped because legal title has passed to the distributor  and iii we record deferred revenue and deferred cost of inventory under the deferred income on sales to distributors caption in the liability section of our consolidated balance sheets 
we evaluate the deferred cost of inventory component of this account for possible impairment by considering potential obsolescence of products that might be returned to us and by considering the potential of resale prices of these products being below our cost 
by reviewing deferred inventory costs in the manners discussed above  we ensure that any portion of deferred inventory costs that are not recoverable from future contractual revenue are charged to cost of sales as an expense 
deferred income on sales to distributors effectively represents the gross margin on sales to distributors  however  the amount of gross margin we recognize in future periods may be less than the originally recorded deferred income as a result of negotiated price concessions 
in recent years  such concessions have exceeded of list price on average 
for detail of this account balance  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenues from other distributors at the time of shipment and when title and risk of loss transfer to the distributor  in accordance with the terms specified in the arrangement  and when the four above mentioned revenue recognition criteria are met 
these distributors may also be given business terms to return a portion of inventory  however they do not receive credits for changes in selling prices to end customers 
at the time of shipment  product prices are fixed and determinable and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated and accrued 
revenue from the sale and license of intellectual property is recognized when the above mentioned four revenue recognition criteria are met 
development revenue is recognized when services are performed and customer acceptance has been received and was not significant for any of the periods presented 
deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions we have provided a full valuation allowance against our u 
s federal and state deferred tax assets 
if sufficient evidence of our ability to generate future u 
s federal and or state taxable income becomes apparent  we may be required to reduce our valuation allowance  resulting in income tax benefits in our statement of operations 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance quarterly 
in july  the fasb issued interpretations that clarify the 
table of contents accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification  income taxes  or asc and prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under the new interpretations  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  the new interpretations provide guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
impairment of long lived assets we regularly monitor and review long lived assets  including fixed assets  goodwill and intangible assets  for impairment including whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  growth rates and other factors 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in our operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we recorded asset impairment charges on certain long lived assets totaling million in the second quarter of fiscal for further information on these asset impairments see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  established the accounting standards codification  or codification  as the source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb 
the codification is effective in the first interim and annual periods ending after september  and had no effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued provisions under accounting standards codification  fair value measurements and disclosures  or asc  in order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements by defining fair value  establishing a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expanding disclosures about fair value measurements 
the new provisions emphasize that fair value is market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
they also clarify the extent to which fair value is used to measure recognized assets and liabilities  the inputs used to develop measurements  and the effect of certain measurements on earnings for the period 
the provisions issued in september are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and are applied on a prospective basis 
in february  the fasb released additional provisions under asc which delayed the effective date of the september provisions for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
in october  the fasb issued more provisions under asc  which clarify the application of the september provisions in a market that is not active 
on october   we adopted the september provisions for financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring and non recurring basis and the october provisions 
consistent with the february updates  we elected to defer the adoption of the september provisions for non financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non recurring basis until october  the adoption of asc for non financial assets and liabilities is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued provisions under accounting standard codification  financial instruments  that provide companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 

table of contents the standard s objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
the standard requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of a company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
it also requires a company to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
the new standard does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards 
on october   we adopted this new standard but did not elect the fair value option for any additional financial assets or liabilities that we held at that date 
in june  the fasb issued provisions under accounting standards codification  research development  relating to the accounting for non refundable advanced payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
the new provisions require that these payments be deferred and capitalized and expensed as goods are delivered or as the related services are performed 
on october   we adopted these provisions 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued three related accounting provisions i accounting standards codification  fair value measurements and disclosures transition and open effective date information  or asc  ii accounting standards codification  investments debt and equity securities transition and open effective date information  or asc  and iii accounting standards codification  financial instruments transition and open effective date information  or asc  which will be effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  asc provides guidance on how to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities in the current economic environment and reemphasizes that the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price 
if we were to conclude that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity of the asset or liability in relation to normal market activities  quoted market values may not be representative of fair value and we may conclude that a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate 
asc modifies the requirements for recognizing other than temporarily impaired debt securities and revise the existing impairment model for such securities  by modifying the current intent and ability indicator in determining whether a debt security is other than temporarily impaired 
asc enhances the disclosure of relevant instruments for both interim and annual periods 
the adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued accounting standards codification  subsequent events  which defined the period after the balance sheet date during which a reporting entity shall evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements and the circumstances under which a company shall recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements 
this standard also requires a company to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated for recognition or disclosure in the financial statements 
we reflected the recognition and disclosure requirements of this standard in this annual report on form k 
in december  the fasb issued provisions under accounting standards codification  business combinations  or asc  which established principles and requirements for the acquirer of a business to recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets including in process research and development and defensive assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
prior to the adoption of asc  in process research and development costs were immediately expensed and acquisition costs were capitalized 
under asc  all acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
the standard also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
in april  the fasb updated asc to amend the provisions for the initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting  and disclosures for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations 
this update also eliminates the distinction between contractual and non contractual contingencies 
asc is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we will be required to adopt asc in the first quarter of fiscal we expect asc will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date 

table of contents in september  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on accounting standards update  or asu   revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu and asu  software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  or asu asu modifies the requirements that must be met for an entity to recognize revenue from the sale of a delivered item that is part of a multiple element arrangement when other items have not yet been delivered 
asu eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements must have either i vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value or ii third party evidence tpe before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement consideration that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
overall arrangement consideration will be allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relative selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on the entity s estimated selling price 
the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration has been eliminated 
asu modifies the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude from its scope tangible products that contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality 
these new updates are effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of these asus will have on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net revenues fiscal compared to fiscal  fiscal compared to fiscal the following table summarizes our net revenues change change dollars in millions multiservice access dsp products high performance analog products wan communications products intellectual property net revenues the decrease in our net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal reflects declines in two of our product families  with the largest decrease in demand occurring in our wan communications products  as well as a decrease in revenues from the sale and licensing of intellectual property 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in revenues in our multiservice access dsp products 
net revenues from our multiservice access dsp products increased million  or  mainly reflecting an increase in shipments for fiber to the building fttb deployments  particularly in asia  partially offset by decreased demand at one of our large strategic north american customers 
we are experiencing increased sales volumes of our voip product families as telecommunication service providers install equipment to transmit their voice traffic over ip data networks 
we believe we are benefiting from the deployment of ip based networks both in new network buildouts and the replacement of circuit switched networks 
net revenues from our high performance analog products decreased million  or  when comparing fiscal to fiscal within high performance analog  we are experiencing a benefit from increased demand for our crosspoint switches  which are used in telecommunications applications 
this benefit was offset by weak economic conditions affecting our physical media devices  which are used in infrastructure equipment for fiber to the premise deployments  metropolitan area networks and wide area networks 
net revenues from our wan communications products decreased million  or  mainly reflecting a dramatic decrease in demand due to weak economic conditions  particularly in north america and europe 
this decrease in demand was primarily in our atm mpls network processor products  our t e carrier transmission products and our carrier ethernet products 

table of contents the increase in our net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was driven by an increase in revenues from the sale and licensing of intellectual property  as well as an increase in product sales 
during fiscal  we recognized million from the sale and licensing of patents compared to million in fiscal the remaining million of the increase in revenues represents higher product shipments in our multiservice access dsp and high performance analog product families 
net revenues from our multiservice access dsp products increased million  or  reflecting a combination of increased sales volumes across our newer voip product families  including our multiservice access carrier products for fttb deployments  particularly in asia 
we believe we benefitted from the increasing deployment of ip based networks both in new network buildouts worldwide and the replacement of circuit switched networks 
net revenues from our high performance analog products increased million  or  reflecting a benefit from increased demand for our switching and signal conditioning products 
net revenues from our wan communications products did not change in fiscal when compared to fiscal gross margin change change dollars in millions gross margin percent of net revenues gross margin represents net revenues less cost of goods sold 
as a fabless semiconductor company  we use third parties including tsmc  amkor and ase for wafer fabrication and assembly and test services 
our cost of goods sold consists predominantly of purchased finished wafers  assembly and test services  royalty and other intellectual property costs  labor and overhead costs associated with supply chain management  engineering expenses pertaining to products sold  and any applicable asset impairment charges 
our gross margin for fiscal decreased million from fiscal  principally reflecting a decrease in revenues  as well as asset impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of our product sales decreased million  or  compared to and our sale or licensing of intellectual property decreased million  or 
the decrease in our gross margin as a percent of net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the drop in revenues from the sale or licensing of intellectual property  which have little associated cost  as well as product mix changes and reduced levels of overhead absorption caused by a lower level of product sales in the decrease in gross margin in fiscal was also impacted by asset impairment charges of million recorded in fiscal asset impairments consisted of million related to the write down of the carrying value of technology developed by ample communications  a million write down of ample communications related inventory  and an approximate  write down of certain manufacturing related fixed assets 
gross margin as a percent of net revenues for fiscal includes an approximate effect from these asset impairments 
our gross margin for fiscal increased million from fiscal million of this increase in gross margin was due to an increase in intellectual property sales with associated revenues growing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal additionally  our gross margin for fiscal increased as a result of increased product sales 
our gross margin as a percent of net revenues for fiscal increased from fiscal primarily as a result of this increase in intellectual property revenues  which have little associated cost 
our gross margin benefited from the sale of inventories with an original cost of million fiscal  million fiscal  and million fiscal that we had written down to a zero cost basis during fiscal these sales resulted from renewed demand for certain products that was not anticipated at the time of the write downs 
the previously written down inventories were generally sold at prices which exceeded their original cost 
as of october   we continued to hold inventories with an original cost of million which were previously written down to a zero cost basis 
we currently intend to hold these remaining inventories and will sell these inventories if we continue to experience a renewed demand for these products 
while there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so  if we are able to sell a portion of the inventories which are carried at zero cost basis  our gross margin will be favorably affected by an amount equal to the original cost of the zero cost basis inventory sold 
to the extent that we do not experience renewed demand for the remaining inventories  they will be scrapped as they become obsolete 

table of contents research and development change change dollars in millions research and development expenses percent of net revenues our research and development r d expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs  photomasks  electronic design automation tools and pre production evaluation and test costs 
the million decrease in r d expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily driven by a million decrease in compensation and personnel related costs mainly due to a focused effort to reduce costs associated with our workforce  including headcount reductions associated with our restructuring activities 
in addition  r d expense in fiscal included  related to severance benefits payable to certain former employees as a result of organizational changes  which were not incurred in fiscal the million decrease in r d expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal principally reflects a million decrease in depreciation expense  principally resulting from certain assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives 
in addition  the decrease in r d expenses reflects a  decrease in compensation and personnel related costs  resulting from our expense reduction actions and a  decrease in the cost of our facilities 
these decreases in r d were partially offset by an  increase in employee separation costs which consist of severance benefits payable to certain former employees as a result of organizational changes 
selling  general and administrative change change dollars in millions selling  general and administrative expenses percent of net revenues our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include personnel costs  independent sales representative commissions  product marketing  applications engineering and other marketing costs 
our sg a expenses also include costs of corporate functions including accounting  finance  legal  human resources  information systems and communications 
the million decrease in our sg a expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects a million decrease in compensation and personnel related costs  including stock compensation expense mainly due to a focused effort to reduce costs associated with our workforce  including headcount reductions associated with our restructuring activities 
in addition  sg a expense decreased million as a result of decreased spending on professional fees in fiscal and a  decrease in commissions paid to our sales representatives 
in addition  sg a expense decreased  in fiscal due to a decrease in expenses incurred related to severance benefits payable to former officers and employees 
the million increase in our sg a expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal reflects an increase of  in labor and benefits  including stock compensation  due to an increase in the cost of benefits offered to our employees  as well as  in employee separation costs which consist of severance benefits payable to certain former employees as a result of organizational changes 
additionally  we experienced a million increase in professional fees 
the increase in professional fees is primarily due to expenses incurred in conjunction with business development activities and effecting a reverse stock split 
special charges special charges consist of the following dollars in millions asset impairments restructuring charges total special charges 
table of contents asset impairments during fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges of million 
included in this amount are asset impairment charges of approximately  related to software and property and equipment that we determined to abandon or scrap  as well as asset impairment charges of million to write down the carrying value of goodwill related to our acquisition of certain assets of ample communications 
in the second quarter of fiscal  our ample reporting unit experienced a severe decline in sales and profitability due to a significant decline in demand that we believe was a result of the downturn in global economic conditions  as well as a bankruptcy filed by the reporting unit s most significant customer 
the drop in market demand resulted in significant declines in unit sales 
due to these market and economic conditions  our ample reporting unit experienced a significant decline in market value 
as a result  we concluded that there were sufficient factual circumstances for interim impairment analyses 
accordingly  in the second quarter of fiscal  we performed a goodwill impairment assessment 
based on the results of our assessment of goodwill for impairment  we determined that the carrying value of the ample reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value 
therefore  we performed a second step of the impairment test to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill 
the required analysis indicated that there would be no remaining implied value attributable to goodwill in the ample reporting unit and we impaired the entire goodwill balance of million 
restructuring charges mindspeed second quarter fiscal restructuring plan in the second quarter of fiscal  we announced the implementation of cost reduction measures with most of the savings expected to be derived from focused reductions in the areas of sales  general and administrative and wide area networking communication spending  including the closure of our dubai facility

we expect to pay these obligations over their respective terms  which expire at various dates through fiscal mindspeed restructuring plans in fiscal and  we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives to improve our operating cost structure 
these cost reduction initiatives included workforce reductions  significant reductions in capital spending and the consolidation of certain facilities 
activity under these initiatives was minimal in fiscal and there is no remaining accrued restructuring balance related to these plans at october  interest expense dollars in millions interest expense interest expense for fiscal  and represents interest on our convertible senior notes issued in december and july in october  we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes  thereby decreasing our interest expense related to these notes for the remainder of fiscal the interest expense increase for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is a result of our extinguishment and reissuance of million of our convertible notes which occurred in july of the interest rate on these convertible senior notes increased from to 
other income  net dollars in millions other income  net other income principally consists of interest income  foreign exchange gains and losses  franchise taxes and other non operating gains and losses 
the increase in other income in fiscal principally reflects the million gain we recorded in connection with the extinguishment of million aggregate principle amount of our convertible senior notes for cash of million 
in connection with the extinguishment  approximately  in debt discount and debt issuance costs were written off 
provision for income taxes dollars in millions provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes for fiscal years  and principally consisted of income taxes incurred by our foreign subsidiaries 
as a result of our recent operating losses and the potential of future operating results  we determined that it is more likely than not that the us federal and state income tax benefits principally net operating losses we can carry forward to future years which arose during fiscal  and will not be realized 
accordingly  we have not recognized any income tax benefits relating to our us federal and state operating losses for those periods and we do not expect to recognize any income tax benefits relating to future 
table of contents operating losses until we believe that such tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized 
we expect that our provision for income taxes for fiscal will principally consist of income taxes related to our foreign operations 
as of october   we had a valuation allowance of million against our us federal and state deferred tax assets which reduces their carrying value to zero because we do not expect to realize these deferred tax assets through the reduction of future income tax payments 
as of october   we had us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  including the net operating loss carryforwards we retained in the distribution 
we can provide no assurances that we will be able to retain or fully utilize such net operating loss carryforwards  or that such net operating loss carryforwards will not be significantly limited in the future 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalent balances  cash generated from product sales and the sales or licensing of our intellectual property  and our line of credit with silicon valley bank 
as of october   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
our working capital at october  was million 
in order to regain and sustain profitability and positive cash flows from operations  we may need to further reduce operating expenses and or increase revenues 
we have completed a series of cost reduction actions which have improved our operating expense structure  and we will continue to perform additional actions  when necessary 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we announced a restructuring plan 
these expense reductions alone may not allow us to return to the profitability we achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal our ability to achieve the necessary revenue growth to return to profitability will depend on increased demand for network infrastructure equipment that incorporates our products  which in turn depends primarily on the level of capital spending by communications service providers and enterprises the level of which may decrease due to general economic conditions  and uncertainty  over which we have no control 
we may not be successful in achieving the necessary revenue growth or we may be unable to sustain past and future expense reductions in subsequent periods 
we may not be able to regain or sustain profitability 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  along with cash expected to be generated from product sales and the sale and licensing of intellectual property  will be sufficient to fund our operations research and development efforts  anticipated capital expenditures  working capital and other financing requirements for the next months 
in november  we repaid the million outstanding balance of our senior convertible debt  and have no other principal payments on currently outstanding debt due in the next months 
from time to time  we may acquire our debt securities through privately negotiated transactions  tender offers  exchange offers for new debt or other securities  redemptions or otherwise  upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine appropriate 
we will need to continue a focused program of capital expenditures to meet our research and development and corporate requirements 
we may also consider acquisition opportunities to extend our technology portfolio and design expertise and to expand our product offerings 
in order to fund capital expenditures  increase our working capital or complete any acquisitions  we may seek to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
we may also need to seek to obtain additional debt or equity financing if we experience downturns or cyclical fluctuations in our business that are more severe or longer than anticipated or if we fail to achieve anticipated revenue and expense levels 
however  we cannot assure you that such financing will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all particularly in light of recent economic conditions in the capital markets

conexant warrant on june   conexant systems  inc completed the distribution to conexant stockholders of all outstanding shares of common stock of our company  its wholly owned subsidiary 
following the distribution  we began operations as an independent  publicly held company 
in the distribution  we issued to conexant a warrant to purchase six million shares of our common stock at a price of per share  exercisable for a period of ten years after the distribution 
the warrant may be transferred or sold in whole or part at any time 
the warrant contains antidilution provisions that provide for adjustment of the exercise price  and the number of shares issuable under the warrant  upon the occurrence of certain events 
if we issue  or are deemed to have issued  shares of our common stock  or securities convertible into our common stock  at prices below the current market price of our common stock as defined in the warrants at the time of the issuance of such securities  the warrant s exercise price will be reduced and the number of shares issuable under the warrant will be increased 
the amount of such adjustment if any  will be determined pursuant to a formula specified in the warrant and will depend on the number of shares issued  the offering price and the current market price of our common stock at the time of the issuance of such securities 
adjustments to the warrant pursuant to these antidilution provisions may result in significant dilution to the interests of our existing stockholders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the antidilution provisions may also limit our ability to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us 
in conjunction with the equity offering we completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the warrant was adjusted to represent the right to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
moreover  we may not realize any cash proceeds from the exercise of the warrant held by conexant 
a holder of the warrant may opt for a cashless exercise of all or part of the warrant 
in a cashless exercise  the holder of the warrant would make no cash payment to us and would receive a number of shares of our common stock having an aggregate value equal to the excess of the then current market price of the shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant over the exercise price of the warrant 
such an issuance of common stock would be immediately dilutive to the interests of other stockholders

the remaining million of the notes bear interest at a rate of  payable semiannually in arrears each february and august  and mature on august  in june  we extended our sublease with conexant pursuant to which we lease our headquarters in newport beach  california 
the sublease  which had been amended and restated in march  had an initial term through june the sublease was extended for an additional two year term through june for a reduced amount of space 
rent payable under the sublease for the next months is approximately million 
rent payable is subject to annual increases of  plus a prorated portion of operating expenses associated with the leased property 
we estimate our minimum future obligation under the sublease at approximately million over the remainder of the lease term  but actual costs under the sublease will vary based upon conexant s actual costs 
in addition  each year we may elect to purchase certain services from conexant based on a prorated portion of conexant s actual costs 
we lease our other facilities and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
the leases expire at various dates through and contain various provisions for rental adjustments  including  in certain cases  adjustments based on increases in the consumer price index 
the leases generally contain renewal provisions for varying periods of time 
although we have entered into non cancelable subleases with anticipated rental income totaling  and extending to various dates through fiscal  we have not reduced the amount of our contractual obligations under the related operating leases to take into account the anticipated rental income 
purchase obligations are comprised of commitments to purchase design tools and software for use in product development  which will be spent between fiscal and fiscal we have not included open purchase orders for inventory or other expenses issued in the normal course of business in the purchase obligations shown above 
in addition to the obligations included in the table above  we have a  liability related to post retirement benefits for employees at two of our international locations 
the timing of the related payments is not known 
off balance sheet arrangements we have made guarantees and indemnities  under which we may be required to make payments to a guaranteed or indemnified party  in relation to certain transactions 
in connection with the distribution  we generally assumed responsibility for all contingent liabilities and then current and future litigation against conexant or its subsidiaries related to our business 
we may also be responsible for certain federal income tax liabilities under a tax allocation agreement between us and conexant  which provides that we will be responsible for certain taxes imposed on us  conexant or conexant stockholders 
in connection with certain facility leases  we have indemnified our lessors for certain claims arising from the facility or the lease 
we indemnify our directors  officers  employees and agents to 
table of contents the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of delaware 
the duration of the guarantees and indemnities varies  and in many cases is indefinite 
the majority of our guarantees and indemnities do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these guarantees and indemnities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at october   our cash and cash equivalents consisted solely of cash 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or investment purposes 
interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk 
as of october   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value 
at october   our debt consisted of our short term and long term convertible senior notes 
our convertible senior notes bear interest at fixed rates of and 
consequently  our results of operations and cash flows are not subject to any significant interest rate risk relating to our convertible senior notes 
in addition  we have a long term revolving credit facility 
advances under our credit facility bear interest at a variable rate ranging from prime plus to a maximum rate of prime plus  as determined in accordance with the interest rate grid set forth in the loan and security agreement 
if the prime rate increases  thereby increasing our effective borrowing rate by the same amount  cash interest expense related to the credit facility would increase dependent on any outstanding borrowings 
because there were no outstanding borrowings on the credit facility as of october   any change in the prime interest rate would not have a material effect on our obligations under the credit facility 
foreign exchange risk we transact business in various foreign currencies and we face foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the majority of our foreign exchange risks are not hedged  however  from time to time  we may utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign exchange risk 
these hedging transactions are intended to offset the gains and losses we experience on foreign currency transactions with gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate our overall risk of foreign exchange gains and losses 
we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
at october   we held no foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at october   a change in currency rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
