item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations general our business is comprised of three reportable segments 
the north american retail division includes our retail office supply stores in the us and canada  which offer office supplies  computers and business machines and related supplies  and office furniture 
most stores also offer a design  print and ship center offering graphic design  printing  reproduction  mailing and shipping 
the north american business solutions division sells office supply products and services in the us and canada directly to businesses through catalogs  internet web sites and a dedicated sales force 
our international division sells office products and services through catalogs  internet web sites  a dedicated sales force and retail stores 
our fiscal year results are based on a or week retail calendar ending on the last saturday in december 
each of the three years addressed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is based on weeks 
our comparable store sales relate to stores that have been open for at least one year 
overview economic factors and company performance fiscal year was a very difficult period for the company 
the housing crisis that began in california and florida in deepened in and spilled over to other sectors of the us economy and then the global economy 
a wide range of underlying asset values decreased and in turn  contributed to a banking and credit crisis  as well as extreme volatility in the stock market 
we entered a recessionary period combined with a systemic lack of liquidity and deep cuts in corporate spending 
all of these factors contributed to a difficult retail environment 
while we worked hard to anticipate and satisfy our customers needs  we clearly did not meet our goals 
as a result  the company has reported a decline in sales and gross margins  as well as significant asset impairments and other charges  resulting in a significant loss for the year 
we cannot predict the future  but most economists anticipate another difficult year in this outlook of continued recessionary factors has contributed to the severity of some of the impairment charges recognized in we will continue to focus on the needs of our small to medium sized customers  controlling cash flows  expanding our private brands and providing solutions to all customers 
summary of charges at the time we reported our third quarter results  we also announced the launch of an internal review of assets and processes with the goal of positioning the company to deal with the deepening economic crisis and to benefit from its eventual improvement 
the results of that internal review led to decisions to close stores  exit certain businesses and write off certain assets that were not seen as providing future benefit 
these decisions resulted in material charges  some of which were recognized during the fourth quarter of  and others which will be recognized during as the related accounting criteria are met 
additional information about these activities is provided below 
we will manage these activities at a corporate level and the impacts will be disclosed as corporate charges and will not be reflected in the division operating results 
in addition to the charges that relate to these changes in business  we recognized other material charges because of the downturn in our business 
those charges include material asset impairments relating to stores we will continue to operate  charges to impair amortizing customer relationship intangible assets  as well as an increase in our allowance for bad debts related to our private label credit card portfolio and certain other accounts receivable balances to reflect the current economic downturn 
these charges are considered reflective of operating an ongoing business in difficult times and are included in division operating results 
we also recognized material goodwill and trade name impairment charges during the factors and amounts associated with these and other charges reported internally at the corporate level collectively  the charges are discussed below 
goodwill and trade name impairment charges as a result of our annual fourth quarter review of goodwill and other non amortizing intangible assets  we recorded non cash charges of billion to write down goodwill and million related to the impairment of trade names 
our recoverability assessment of these non amortizing intangible assets considers company specific projections  assumptions about market participant views and the company s overall market capitalization around the testing period 
all of those factors worsened during compared to amounts used for the evaluations 

table of contents beginning in  we discussed in our periodic reports the adverse impacts on our business from several broad economic drivers 
we continually adjusted our activities during in an effort to address the impact these factors were having on our customers and lessen the adverse impact on our results 
through the third quarter of  we assessed our full year forecast compared to the base year used in our prior year goodwill test and looked to a recent acquisition in the office supply sector as an indicator of then current market participant information 
at that time  our stock price had begun to decline  but it had not sustained a low valuation for an extended period of time 
we had announced the beginning of a business review to be conducted by each of the divisions  but the potential impacts were uncertain at that time 
considering these factors  we concluded that the accounting criteria requiring an acceleration of our goodwill testing had not been met at the end of the third quarter 
the changes in business conditions since that time are considered significant 
initial decisions from our fourth quarter business review included the closing of stores in north america and internationally  the exiting of certain unproductive businesses and the curtailing of capital expenditures throughout the company 
because of the current real estate markets  some of these decisions will require the use of cash for several years as the opportunities for subleasing vacant locations appears limited 
these changes  combined with the extreme volatility and related deepening economic crisis experienced during the fourth quarter  lower than expected full year operating results  continued recessionary projections for and significant uncertainty about when the global economy will recover  have contributed to reduced projected cash flows and higher risk adjusted discount rates used in our current analysis compared to those used in our goodwill test for and carried forward through our third quarter considerations 
for our test  we assessed our valuations with discount rates of approximately to without changing the impairment conclusion 
our test included a discount rate 
this increase reflects the significantly higher risk in the overall market and particularly with specialty retailers  as well as a reduction in our credit rating during our projections include anticipated benefits from a re leveraging of sales when conditions improved 
we anticipate a continued challenging environment for followed by some recovery beginning in in north america and beginning in for our international operations 
in each of the reporting units  we have estimated a terminal value based on a normal growth model 
given current market uncertainties  we believe this captures the periodic cycles inherent in any forward forecast of operations and is a better indicator than the multiple of ending year cash flow used in prior analyses 
to assess the reasonableness of our calculations  the resulting estimated fair values of all reporting units were aggregated and compared to an average market capitalization equity and debt during late  including a control premium of approximately to  depending on the discount rate used to assess the projected cash flows  the higher the discount rate  the lower the resulting control premium 
the market capitalization around the goodwill test was in excess of then current book value and corroborated the conclusion of no impairment at that time 
for the test  the estimated fair values indicated that the second step of goodwill impairment analysis was required in four of our five reporting units  and that analysis showed that the current value of goodwill could not be sustained in those four reporting units 
accordingly  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of billion  relating to the following reporting units north american retail  million  north american contract  million  europe  million  and asia  million 
included in these impairment charges is goodwill resulting from and later acquisitions 
all of these entities are considered integrated into their respective reporting units and their cash flows were aggregated with all other cash flows of the respective reporting unit in the determination of estimated fair value 
additionally  in light of the significant adverse economic conditions which developed later in the year  we looked for current market transactions that could provide perspective to our analysis  but no relevant purchase transactions could be found 
approximately million of goodwill associated with the north american direct reporting unit was not impaired 
this reporting unit has a relatively low net investment and projected cash flows were sufficient to recover its net assets 
based on the fair value estimate in excess of the carrying value  the company currently does not anticipate a risk of goodwill impairment for this reporting unit 
the impairment of trade names totaled approximately million and primarily relates to the niceday brand name which was part of a business acquisition in we have decided to shift the emphasis in the related markets away from this brand name to products with the office depot and other private brand names 
accordingly  we lowered the expected contribution from this trade name and  combined with the factors above  a non cash impairment charge was recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
because the brand is expected to be retained but with lower prominence  it remains a non amortizing intangible asset 
exit costs during  we announced a number of material charges relating to asset impairments  exit costs and other operating decisions that resulted from a wide ranging assessment of assets and commitments 
it was disclosed that additional charges would be recognized when the identified plans were implemented and the related accounting criteria were met 
associated pre tax charges in and totaled million and million  respectively 
the few remaining exit activities from the planned business changes 
table of contents have been incorporated into the activities related to our internal review that began in the fourth quarter of as mentioned above  we manage the costs and programs associated with these activities the charges at a corporate level  and accordingly  these amounts are not included in determining division operating profit 
additional information about the costs and programs associated with the charges is provided below 
a summary of the charges and the line item presentation of these amounts in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations is as follows 
dollars in millions  except per share amounts amounts amounts amounts cost of goods sold and occupancy costs store and warehouse operating and selling expenses goodwill and trade name impairments other asset impairments general and administrative expenses total pre tax charges income tax effect after tax impact per share impact the primary components of charges associated with exit activities include store closures north america during the fourth quarter of  we identified stores in north america to be closed by the end of the first quarter of  with an additional stores identified to be closed during as their leases expire or other lease arrangements are finalized 
as of december   six of the stores had been closed  and the number of additional stores to be closed had been reduced to ten  net of relocated stores 
the stores being closed are underperforming stores or stores that are no longer a strategic fit for the company 
in making the decision on which stores to close  we considered sales  operating profit  cash flow  condition of the shopping center  location of other stores in the proximity and customer demographics  among other factors 
the stores to be closed are located in various geographic regions  including in the central us  in the northeast and canada  in the west and eight in the south 
many of these customers may shop in alternative locations or through the company s other distribution channels 
we have not accounted for these closures as discontinued operations 
the total charges for these closures are estimated to be million  with approximately million recorded in the fourth quarter of and the balance to be recognized during as the stores are closed 
the amounts include approximately million of inventory write downs because the company executed an agreement with a third party liquidator in north america establishing the recoverable amount for inventory in those specific stores 
these inventory write downs are presented in cost of goods sold and occupancy costs in our consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  approximately million is for asset impairment  million is associated with severance and one time termination benefit accruals  and million represents other facility closure costs 
as mentioned above  six of the stores were closed by year end and approximately million was recognized for the estimated period of economic loss under the associated operating lease contracts 
additional severance of approximately million will be recognized as services are performed over the closure period and applicable lease accruals will be recognized when the facilities are closed during we currently estimate approximately million of lease charges to be recognized in  but the amount may change as sublease assumptions are refined and then current risk adjusted discount rates applied 
we are currently using discount rates ranging from to to discount these multi year obligations 
reduction in store openings north america we have reduced the number of new store openings for to approximately  from the previous estimate of stores 
this reduction resulted in the recognition in of approximately million for the estimated period of economic loss under the operating lease contracts associated with the stores that will not be opened 
we expect to record approximately million in lease costs for these activities during store closures international we have decided to exit the retail sales channel in japan during because most of our stores in that country are unprofitable 
the total charges for these closures is estimated to be million  with approximately million recorded in the fourth quarter of and the balance to be recognized during as the stores are closed 
the charges are primarily associated with asset impairments  and the charges include severance related expenses  lease costs and other facility closure costs of million  million and million  respectively 
additionally  we expect to incur charges associated with residual inventory values from these closed facilities  however  these values cannot be reasonably estimated 

table of contents supply chain consolidation north america during  our current plan is to close five distribution centers and one crossdock facility to streamline our supply chain 
these facilities are near the end of their initial lease terms and projected closure costs total approximately million  with million recognized during for severance related costs 
the remainder of the charges relate to one time termination benefits of million  lease costs of million and other exit costs including deconstruction expenses of million 
additionally  we expect to incur charges associated with residual inventory values from these closed facilities  however  these values cannot be reasonably estimated 
supply chain consolidation international we have substantially completed the consolidation of our distribution centers in europe with one closure planned for during  we recorded approximately million in exit costs associated with this activity 
these costs consisted primarily of accelerated depreciation  severance related expenses and future lease obligations  which totaled million  million and million  respectively 
we also recorded million in charges related to other facility closure costs in we expect to record approximately million in charges for these activities during the charges include lease costs  severance related expenses  accelerated depreciation and other facility closure costs of million  million  million and million  respectively 
call center and back office restructuring international during  we began the consolidation of our call centers and back office operations in europe 
we recorded approximately million of charges related to these activities in  of which million was associated with severance and other one time termination benefits 
the remaining million of charges incurred in related to other exit activities 
we expect to record approximately million in severance related charges and million in lease costs for these activities during additional employee reductions each of the divisions  as well as corporate  have identified positions that have been or will be eliminated in an effort to be more responsive to either customer needs or to centralize activities and eliminate geographic redundancies 
total severance and one time benefit costs associated with these actions are estimated to be approximately million  with million recognized during asset write downs as a result of the fourth quarter business review  the company determined that it would no longer use the functionality in certain software applications and accordingly  recognized a charge of approximately million to write down previously capitalized software costs that will not be providing future economic benefit 
additionally  during late  the company substantially lowered its expectations for new store openings and store remodels and determined that certain other projects would not be completed 
the company also concluded that possible acquisitions would not be completed before the end of the year  if at all 
previously deferred costs for these activities  which totaled approximately million  were expensed during the fourth quarter of other restructuring activities during  we recorded approximately million of charges associated with other restructuring activities related to enhancing efficiencies throughout the company 
of these charges  approximately million related to the harmonization of our product offerings in europe  which resulted in a write down of inventory in the fourth quarter of of the remaining charges  approximately million related to the acceleration of depreciation on certain assets and million was for lease costs 
we expect to recognize additional charges of approximately million in related to restructuring activities not identified above 
a summary of past and estimated future charges is presented below dollars in millions actual actual actual projected goodwill and trade name impairments other asset impairments and accelerated depreciation cost of goods sold lease obligations contract terminations one time termination benefits other associated costs total pre tax charges as with any estimate  the timing and amounts may change when projects are implemented 
additionally  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may impact amounts reported in us dollars related to our foreign activities 
of the total and projected charges  approximately million either have or are expected to require cash settlement  including longer term lease obligations that will require cash over multi year lease terms  approximately  million of charges are non cash items 

table of contents summary of operating results a summary of factors important to understanding our results for is provided below and further discussed in the narrative that follows this overview 
total company sales were billion in  down compared to sales in north america decreased for the year and comparable store sales in north american retail decreased 
international division sales increased in us dollars and decreased in local currencies 
gross margin for declined basis points from  following a basis point decline in the prior year 
the decline reflects deleveraging of fixed property costs resulting from the reduced sales  as well as increased promotional activity  partially offset by shifts in product and customer mix 
non cash charges for impairment of goodwill and trade names totaled billion 
other non cash asset impairment charges in totaled million  pretax  and relate primarily to the impairment of store assets in the north american retail division  certain software applications no longer used and impairment of customer list intangible assets in the international division 
of this total  million is included as a component of the charges 
additional pre tax charges of approximately million  million and million were recognized in  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for was  reflecting the largely non deductible nature of the goodwill impairment charge  as well as the impact of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and other adjustments 
diluted loss earnings per share for   and were   and  respectively 
the charges had a per share impact of  and in  and  respectively 
cash flow from operating activities was million in  compared to million in  primarily reflecting improvement in working capital that was significantly offset by the reduction in business performance 
total company our overall sales decreased in  and increased in  and in adverse economic conditions throughout our sales territories contributed to the decline 
the sales increase was driven by higher us dollar sales in the international division and essentially flat sales in north america 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflects significant deleveraging of fixed property costs in  as well as the impact of a highly promotional environment in both and in  gross margin benefited from a shift to core supplies 
gross margins in were adversely impacted by a shift in category mix to lower margin products  a shift in customer mix  inventory clearance activities  and cost increases 
an increase in private brand sales benefited gross margin in both periods 
total operating expenses as a percentage of sales was in  in and in the amount includes goodwill and trade name impairment charges of of sales and other asset impairments of of sales 
expressed as a percentage of sales  the remaining operating expenses were approximately basis points higher than in this change reflects the impact of relatively fixed levels of labor costs on a declining sales base  as well as increases in legal and professional fees and the impact of no bonus expense in the decrease in total operating expenses as a percentage of sales resulted primarily from lower performance based pay across all of our divisions in response to lower operating results 
lower advertising costs and pre opening expenses also contributed to the decrease in operating and selling expenses as a percentage of sales 
these positive impacts were partially offset by higher selling expenses and supply chain costs  as well as investments made to support growth initiatives in our international division 
discussion of other income and expense items  including changes in interest and taxes follows our review of the operating segments 

table of contents north american retail division dollars in millions sales change division operating profit loss of sales total sales in the north american retail division were billion in  a decrease of from sales in were up slightly compared to comparable store sales in from the  stores that were open for more than one year decreased for the full year and showed successive declines throughout each quarter of the year 
the comparable sales declines were across all three primary categories of supplies  technology and furniture and other with more discretionary items such as desks and filing showing the greatest declines 
some of our core supplies areas showed the lowest declines 
comparable store sales in from the  stores that were open for more than one year decreased 
the comparable store sales declines in both and were significantly influenced by the macroeconomic environment  which grew increasingly challenging in as the year progressed 
in  softness in the us housing market resulted in weaker small business and consumer spending  particularly in florida and california  which combined  represented approximately of division sales that year 
however  in  the difficult economic conditions expanded beyond the housing market to the banking and liquidity crisis which has prompted broad governmental intervention in an attempt to stimulate the us economy 
consumer spending declined as a result of economic factors such as the higher cost of such basic consumer staples as gas and food  rising levels of unemployment and personal debt  and reduced access to consumer credit 
management expects the company to continue to face a very difficult economic environment throughout fiscal as the global financial crisis has broadened and intensified  other sectors of the global economy have been adversely impacted and a severe global recession of uncertain length now appears likely 
as a company that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending  we expect to face an extremely challenging because of these economic conditions 
division operating performance in resulted in a million loss  compared to million operating profit in this measure of operating performance is consistent with the internal reporting of results used to manage the business but does not include charges associated with the strategic decision to close stores and one crossdock facility as well as certain other items 
please see charges discussion in the md a overview section above 
operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased by basis points in and basis points in as compared to the prior year 
product margins in were essentially flat with increased promotional and clearance activity largely offsetting an increase from a shift in product mix away from lower margin technology products 
in  product margins decreased approximately basis points from increased promotional activities and a shift in category mix to lower margin items 
although flat for the full year of  we experienced a significant decrease in vendor program funds in the second half of from reduced purchasing levels and as vendors experienced slowdown in their own businesses 
operating margin was negatively impacted in by approximately basis points from a de leveraging of fixed property costs and basis points from higher inventory shrink and valuation charges and higher supply chain costs as a percentage of sales 
in  de leveraging of fixed costs  higher supply chain costs and higher levels of inventory shrink reduced operating margins by basis points 
during  consistent with the downturn in the economy and our performance  we recognized approximately million of asset impairment charges  or basis points expressed as a percentage of sales 
partially offsetting these factors  we expanded our selection of private brands which had a positive impact on operating margins in and while payroll  advertising and other expenses were lower in  because of the reduced sales base  they contributed approximately basis points to the decline in operating margin 
the operating expenses improved operating margin approximately basis points reflecting a reduction in advertising costs as well as lower bonus accruals commensurate with lower division performance and lower pre opening expenses related to a reduction in new store openings 
as we look into  we believe the uncertain economic outlook will continue to challenge our sales and operating profit margin 
we opened new stores during and stores during  all using our m store design 
at the end of  we operated  retail stores in the us and canada 
we anticipate opening approximately stores in during  we plan to close stores in north america  of which are part of the strategic review launched in the fourth quarter of for additional information on this strategic review  see the overview to md a above 
during and  we remodeled stores and stores  respectively 
we exclude the brief remodel period from our comparable store sales calculation to partially account for the disruption 

table of contents north american business solutions division dollars in millions sales change division operating profit of sales sales in our north american business solutions division decreased in and in the sales decrease in reflects the impact of worsening economic conditions and the resulting decline in sales to our small to medium size customer base 
sales to our larger account customers  including the public sector  also declined  especially following the fourth quarter banking crisis  as customers confined more of their purchases to core supplies 
both our contract and direct channels experienced sales declines  with contract down and direct down 
the decrease reflects an reduction in sales from the direct channel  partially offset by sales increases in large and national account customers in the contract channel 
division operating profit totaled million in  compared to million in this measure of operating performance is consistent with the internal reporting of results used to manage the business but does not include charges associated with the strategic decision to close five distribution centers and eliminate certain positions nor a goodwill impairment charge of million recognized at the corporate level 
please see charges discussion in the md a overview section above 
operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased basis points in  following a basis point decline in product margins decreased approximately basis points in from higher promotional activity and customer incentives  partially offset by increased vendor program funds 
operating margin in was negatively impacted by basis points from a combination of higher incentives offered to large and national account customers  a shift in the sales mix to lower margin customers and products  net cost increases that were not fully passed along to our customers  lower vendor program funds  and to a lesser degree  higher inventory clearance charges 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales negatively impacted operating profit in by approximately basis points 
these expenses include an increased accrual for bad debts consistent with the economic downturn  higher advertising expenses in an attempt to stimulate sales and higher professional fees related to operational enhancements  as well as the impact of the declining sales base 
in  operating expenses reduced operating margin by approximately basis points  reflecting de leveraging of division fixed costs  somewhat higher selling costs  and costs associated with certain unprofitable contracts partially offset by lower advertising expenses and lower performance based variable pay resulting from lower division performance 
during  we anticipate continued negative margin impacts 
international division dollars in millions sales change division operating profit of sales sales in our international division in us dollars increased in  and in local currency sales decreased in and increased in the contract channel increased approximately in local currencies during and direct decreased approximately 
we continue to see adverse impacts of worsening economic conditions in the european countries where we have the greatest amount of sales 
we anticipate that these conditions could persist for some time and provide additional challenges to our operations 
in  the contract channel increased sales in local currencies by while sales in the direct channel were slightly negative  reflecting a decline in our business in the uk 
the retail channel  while a smaller part of our offering in this division  increased sales in local currencies in both and the increase resulted  in part  from the impact of acquisitions 
while revenues from our operations in asian markets increased in  the overall contribution from that business continues to be negative 
accordingly  we have committed to closing stores in japan and will pursue other opportunities to modify our business in that region with the intent of growing profitable sales or curtailing operations 

table of contents division operating profit totaled million in  compared to million in this measure of operating performance is consistent with the internal reporting of results used to manage the business but does not include charges associated with the strategic decision to close stores in japan and restructure certain operations nor a goodwill impairment charge of million recognized at the corporate level 
please see charges discussion in the md a overview section above 
operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased basis points in  following a basis point decline in despite improvements in our uk business in  the de leveraging of fixed costs against lower sales levels resulted in approximately basis points of operating margin decline 
a shift to lower margin customers and the impact of acquisitions resulted in a decrease in operating margin of approximately basis points 
also during  we recorded a non cash gain of approximately million related to the curtailment of a defined benefit pension plan in the uk and non cash impairment charges of approximately million related to our customer list intangible assets 
the decrease reflects lower performance of approximately basis points  primarily from the uk  and to a lesser extent  a greater percentage of contract sales in our sales mix 
during  the division established regional offices in asia and latin america  centralized certain support functions in europe  expanded into poland and consolidated certain warehouse facilities 
these investments lowered operating margin by approximately basis points 
partially offsetting the decrease in operating margin in were positive impacts totaling approximately basis points  which resulted primarily from lower performance based variable pay as a result of lower division performance 
we believe the uncertain economic outlook will continue to challenge our sales and operating profit margin in for us reporting  the international division s sales are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates experienced during the year 
the division s reported sales were positively impacted by approximately million in and million in from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
division operating profit was also positively impacted from changes in foreign exchange rates by million in and million in internally  we analyze our international operations in terms of local currency performance to allow focus on operating trends and results 
corporate and other general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses g a increased from million in to million in the portion of g a expenses considered directly or closely related to division activity is included in the measurement of division operating profit 
other companies may charge more or less g a expenses and other costs to their segments  and our results therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the remainder of the total g a expenses are considered corporate expenses 
a breakdown of g a is provided in the following table dollars in millions division g a corporate g a total g a of sales increases in division g a in were primarily driven by higher levels of performance based variable pay and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 
corporate g a includes charges of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
additionally in  we recognized a charge of approximately million to resolve a wage and hour litigation in california 
after considering these charges  corporate g a expenses as a percentage of sales increased approximately basis points from to and decreased by approximately basis points from to the increase primarily reflects higher performance based variable pay as well as costs for professional and legal fees associated with the company s proxy challenge and legal matters described in part i item legal proceedings 
also  during  the company initiated a voluntary exit incentive program for certain employees that resulted in charges for severance expenses of approximately million during the year 
the decrease reflects lower performance based pay  partially offset by higher professional fees and outside labor costs 

table of contents gain on sale of building in december  in connection with a decision to move to a new  leased  headquarters facility  we sold our corporate campus and entered into a leaseback agreement pending completion of the new facility 
the sale resulted in a gain of approximately million recognized in and million deferred over the leaseback period 
we recognized approximately million in amortization of the deferred gain on the sale during both and this amortization largely offset the rent expense during the leaseback period 
during  we entered into a longer term lease on our new corporate campus  and we moved into this new facility during the fourth quarter of other income and expense dollars in millions interest income interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt miscellaneous income  net interest expense increased for compared to  reflecting the impact of additional capital leases as well as a higher level of short term borrowings throughout the year 
the increase in interest expense in also reflected higher levels of short term borrowings compared to additionally  interest expense includes approximately million of incremental expense recorded in connection with reconciliations of amounts due under certain borrowings that are not expected to recur 
the loss on extinguishment of debt in represents the million make whole payment related to settlement of the mortgage on our corporate campus that was sold during that year 
our net miscellaneous income consists of our earnings of joint venture investments  royalty income  gains and losses related to foreign exchange transactions  and realized gains and impairments of other investments 
the majority of miscellaneous income is attributable to equity in earnings from our joint venture in mexico  office depot de mexico 
the change in and reflects higher joint venture earnings offset by foreign currency losses 
income taxes dollars in millions income tax expense benefit effective income tax rate income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate during reflects the largely non deductible nature of the goodwill impairment charge and non deductible foreign interest  as well as the impact of a million increase in deferred tax asset valuation allowances resulting from the change to loss positions in certain jurisdictions 
the decrease in reflects the impact from discrete benefits and current year valuation allowance changes  as well as the impact from a shift in the mix of pretax income  reflecting a higher proportion of international earnings taxed at lower rates 
our operational tax rates before these significant period impacts were approximately in  in and in the discrete items include a benefit of approximately million from the reversal of an accrual for uncertain tax position following a previously disclosed restructuring initiative and a local jurisdiction ruling that secured certain prior year filing positions 
additionally in  because of a jurisdictional restructuring  changes in foreign country tax law and certain book to tax return adjustments  we recognized tax benefits totaling million  primarily related to eliminations of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets 
in general  the effective tax rate can be affected by variability in our mix of income  the tax rates in various jurisdictions  changes in the rules related to accounting for income taxes  outcomes from tax audits that regularly are in process and our assessment of the need for accruals for uncertain tax positions  and therefore may be higher or lower than it has been over the past three years 
however  in  in light of the continued downturn in the economy and our performance  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against existing deferred tax assets 
while we currently cannot predict the likelihood of such an outcome  our effective tax rate may be volatile throughout the year 
any valuation allowances would not impact our cash tax position for the year 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity at december   we had approximately million in cash and equivalents and another million available under our asset based revolving credit facility 
the current and anticipated future difficult economic conditions impact our assessment of short term liquidity  but we consider our resources adequate to satisfy our cash needs 
while much of the loss recorded in resulted from non cash charges for asset impairments  we clearly had lower operating performance as well 
we anticipate the global economy will continue to struggle through  and in response  we have heightened our focus on maximizing operating cash flow and have significantly reduced our anticipated capital expenditures  including limiting the number of new stores and remodels 
also  we do not plan to make additional acquisitions or execute any share repurchases in the near term 
we are working to lower our working capital needs and have reduced inventory levels and focused on cash collections of our accounts receivable balances 
during  we completed several sale leaseback transactions and expect to complete others in we are also considering sales of some of our accounts receivable portfolio 
these possible sales  together with projected cash benefits from actions taken in our fourth quarter business review and other items  could add approximately million of liquidity during as discussed below  we have executed an asset based credit facility that is intended to provide us flexibility needed in these challenging times 
based on our current assessment of and the cash flow options available to us  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to withstand the anticipated continuation of difficult economic conditions 
we hold cash throughout our service areas  but we principally manage our cash through regional headquarters in north america and europe 
we may move cash between those regions from time to time through short term transactions and have used these cash transfers at the end of fiscal quarterly periods to pay down borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities 
although such transfers and debt repayments took place at the end of and each of the first three quarters of  we completed a non taxable distribution to the us in the amount of million during the fourth quarter of  thereby permanently repatriating this cash 
additional distributions  including distributions of foreign earnings or changes in long term arrangements could result in significant additional us tax payments and income tax expense 
currently  there are no plans to change our expectation of foreign earnings reinvestment or the long term nature of our intercompany arrangements  though accounting impacts of any change in these classifications would be recognized in the period of the change 
on september   the company entered into a credit agreement the agreement with a group of lenders  which provides for an asset based  multi currency revolving credit facility the facility of up to billion 
the amount that can be drawn on the facility at any given time is determined based on percentages of certain accounts receivable  inventory and credit card receivables the borrowing base

the agreement also contains representations  warranties  fees  affirmative and negative covenants  and default provisions 
the facility includes limitations in certain circumstances on acquisitions  dispositions  share repurchases and the payment of dividends 
the dividend restrictions are based on the then current and proforma fixed charge coverage ratio and borrowing availability at the point of consideration 
the company has never declared or paid cash dividends on its common stock 
the facility also includes provisions whereby if the global availability is less than million  or the european availability is below million  the company s cash collections go first to the agent to satisfy outstanding borrowings 
further  if total availability falls below million  a fixed charge coverage ratio test is required which  based on current forecasts  could effectively eliminate additional borrowing under the facility 

table of contents at december   the company s borrowings under the facility totaled approximately million at an effective interest rate of approximately 
there were also letters of credit outstanding under the facility totaling approximately million 
an additional million of letters of credit were outstanding under separate agreements 
average borrowings under the facility from september  to december  were approximately million 
the agreement replaced the company s revolving credit facility agreement  which provided for multiple currency borrowings of up to billion and had a sub limit of up to million for standby and trade letter of credit issuances 
the facility had a maturity date of may  in december  the company s credit rating was downgraded which provided the counterparty to the company s private label credit card program the right to terminate the agreement and require the company to repurchase the outstanding balance of approximately million 
both parties entered into a standstill agreement whereby the company permanently waived its early termination right and the counterparty agreed not to terminate the agreement and require repurchase of the outstanding balance until at least march  while a permanent solution was developed 
this standstill agreement precluded the occurrence of cross defaults in certain of the company s agreements 
in february  the company and the counterparty amended the agreement to permanently waive the repurchase clause and the company agreed to amend an existing million letter of credit which may be increased  after december   to as much as million based on an assessment of risk in the portfolio at that time 
in addition to our borrowings under the facility  we had short term borrowings million 
these borrowings primarily represent outstanding balances under various local currency credit facilities for our international subsidiaries that had an effective interest rate at the end of the year of approximately 
cash provided by used in our operating  investing and financing activities is summarized as follows dollars in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in primarily reflects improvement in working capital that was significantly offset by a reduction in business performance 
during  working capital was a source of cash of approximately million compared to a use of approximately million in as mentioned above  we are working to lower our working capital needs and accordingly  during  we reduced inventory levels and focused on cash collections of our accounts receivable balances 
working capital is influenced by a number of factors  including the aging of inventory and timing of vendor payments 
the timing of payments is subject to variability during the year depending on a variety of factors  including the flow of goods  credit terms  timing of promotions  vendor production planning  new product introductions and working capital management 
vendor payment deferrals totaled approximately million at year end  but we made no such deferrals at the end of or the effect of such vendor payment deferrals at period end on our financial statements was to report a higher accounts payable balance and lower balance of outstanding short term borrowings than would otherwise have appeared if the vendor payments had not been deferred 
for our accounting policy on cash management  see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the change in cash flows from operating activities during reflects a decrease in business performance as well as an increase in working capital used during the year 
investing activities we invested million  million and million in capital expenditures during  and  respectively 
this activity includes investments in information technology  the opening  relocating and remodeling of retail stores in north america and distribution network infrastructure costs 
additionally  a portion of our capital expenditures relates to our new corporate headquarters facility 
as mentioned above  we have significantly reduced our anticipated capital expenditures in response to the current economic conditions 
accordingly  we expect capital expenditures to total approximately million in as we are limiting store openings and remodel activities in the near term 
included in the future capital expenditure projections is continued investment in our enterprise wide information technology project that includes capitalized software development costs and related hardware 

table of contents proceeds from the disposition of assets in and include proceeds from sale leaseback transactions of million and million  respectively 
the transactions related to retail store locations and the transaction related to a european warehouse facility 
the realized gains on the sale leaseback transactions are being amortized over the lease terms 
during  we also purchased certain non operating assets for approximately million 
we sold certain of these non operating assets during the year 
we placed restricted cash on deposit in the amount of million and million  respectively  for transactions that were pending at the end of and during  we also received million as dividends from an equity method investment 
during  we acquired a majority ownership position in businesses in india and sweden 
the company has the right to acquire or may be required to purchase some or all of the minority interest shares of these businesses at various points over the next few years 
also during  we acquired under previously existing put options all remaining minority interest shares of our joint ventures in israel and china 
during  we acquired axidata inc  a canada based office products delivery company 
additionally in both and  we funded previously accrued acquisition related payments for former owners of entities acquired in we do not expect to make significant purchases of additional interests from minority shareholders in financing activities cash used in financing activities in primarily resulted from net repayments of short term borrowings under our previously existing revolving credit facility 
at the end of  borrowings under that facility totaled approximately million  all of which was repaid during as mentioned above  this facility was replaced with an asset based credit facility during the third quarter of  which had an outstanding balance of approximately million at the end of in conjunction with our asset based credit facility  we incurred debt issuance costs of approximately million in in addition to repayments on the revolving credit facility  we also repaid certain other borrowings related to our international subsidiaries and made payments on capital leases 
proceeds from the issuance of long and short term debt totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily driven by the decline in our operating cash flow  as we experienced higher levels of short term borrowings to support our working capital needs 
also  in connection with the sale of our corporate campus in  a portion of the proceeds was used to liquidate an existing mortgage on one of the facilities 
the board of directors has authorized open market purchases of our common stock under repurchase plans that were in effect during the three years presented 
we made no share repurchases under the approved plans in we purchased million shares in at a cost of million and million shares in at a cost of million 
at the end of  million remained available for additional repurchases under the most recent board approved plan 
our asset based credit facility has restrictions on share repurchases  and we do not expect to repurchase shares in the near term 
proceeds from issuance of common stock under our employee related plans were minimal during as a result of the drop in our stock price 
in and  these proceeds were million and million  respectively 
additionally  upon the issuance of certain restricted stock awards  employees surrendered shares to the company equal to approximately million in and million in in exchange for our settlement of their taxes due on these shares

contracts that can be unilaterally terminated without a penalty have not been included 
our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes million classified as deferred income taxes and other long term liabilities 
this caption primarily consists of our net long term deferred income taxes  the unfunded portion of our pension plan  deferred lease credits  and liabilities under our deferred compensation plans 
these liabilities have been excluded from the above table as the timing and or the amount of any cash payment is uncertain 
see note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our deferred tax positions and accruals for uncertain tax positions and note h for a discussion of our employee benefit plans  including the pension plan and the deferred compensation plan 
the table above includes scheduled  acquisition related payments 
in addition to the above  we have letters of credit totaling million outstanding at the end of the year  and we have recourse for private label credit card receivables transferred to a third party 
we record an estimate for losses on these receivables in our financial statements 
the total outstanding amount transferred to a third party at the end of the year was approximately million 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements other than those related to our operating lease agreements as described above 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these statements requires management to make judgments and estimates 
some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these financial statements 
a summary of significant accounting policies can be found in note a in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have also identified certain accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and we have provided below additional information on those policies 

table of contents vendor arrangements our inventory purchases from vendors are generally under evergreen arrangements with periodic updates or annual negotiated agreements 
many of these arrangements require the vendors to make payments to us or provide credits to be used against future purchases if and when certain conditions are met 
we generally refer to these arrangements as vendor programs  and they typically fall into two broad categories  with some underlying sub categories 
the largest category is volume based rebates 
generally  our product costs per unit decline as higher volumes of purchases are reached 
many of our vendor agreements provide that we pay higher per unit costs prior to reaching a predetermined tier  at which time the vendor rebates the per unit differential on past purchases  and also applies the lower cost to future purchases until the next milestone is reached 
current accounting rules provide that companies with a sound basis for estimating their full year purchases  and therefore the ultimate rebate level  can use that estimate to value inventory and cost of goods sold throughout the year 
we believe our history of purchases with many vendors provides us with a sound basis for our estimates 
if the anticipated volume of purchases is not reached  however  or if we form the belief at any given point in the year that it is not likely to be reached  cost of goods sold and the remaining inventory balances are adjusted to reflect that change in our outlook 
we review sales projections and related purchases against vendor program estimates at least quarterly and adjust these balances accordingly 
during the fourth quarter of  it became apparent that we were not going to reach the anticipated full year purchase levels and we reduced vendor program income recognized in that period by approximately million 
no similar adjustments were required in any quarter in the second broad category of arrangements with our vendors is event based programs 
these arrangements can take many forms  including advertising support  special pricing offered by certain of our vendors for a limited time  payments for special placement or promotion of a product  reimbursement of costs incurred to launch a vendor s product  and various other special programs 
these payments are classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold or inventory  as appropriate for the program 
some arrangements may meet the specific  incremental  identifiable cost criteria that allow for direct operating expense offset  but such arrangements are not significant 
additionally  we receive payments from vendors for certain of our activities that lower the vendors cost to ship their product to our facilities 
vendor rebates are recognized throughout the year based on judgment and estimates and amounts due from vendors are generally collected throughout the year based on purchase volumes 
the final amounts due from vendors are generally known soon after year end 
substantially all vendor program receivables outstanding at the end of the year are collected within the three months immediately following year end 
we believe that our historic collection rates of these receivables provide a sound basis for our estimates of anticipated vendor payments throughout the year 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we monitor active inventory for excessive quantities and slow moving items and record adjustments as necessary to lower the value if the anticipated realizable amount is below cost 
we also identify merchandise that we plan to discontinue or have begun to phase out and assess the estimated recoverability of the carrying value 
this includes consideration of the quantity of the merchandise  the rate of sale  and our assessment of current and projected market conditions 
if necessary  we record a charge to reduce the carrying value of this merchandise to our estimate of the lower of cost or realizable amount 
additional promotional activities may be initiated and markdowns may be taken as considered appropriate until the product is sold or otherwise disposed 
estimates and judgments are required in determining what items to stock and at what level  and what items to discontinue and how to value them prior to sale 
we also recognize an expense in cost of sales for our estimate of physical inventory loss from theft  short shipment and other factors referred to as inventory shrink 
during the year  we adjust the estimate of our shrink rate accrual following on hand adjustments and our physical inventory results 
these changes in estimates may result in volatility within the year or impact comparisons to other periods 
during  we have lowered our inventory levels to lessen working capital requirements and reduce obsolescence risk 
also  following a strategic review of our business in december  we decided to close stores in north america 
to facilitate these closures  we contracted with a liquidation firm that guaranteed the amount to be realized for the inventory in those stores 
during the fourth quarter  we recognized a million charge to adjust that inventory to the net contracted value 
that adjustment had no impact on the remaining inventory in other stores or in our supply chain 
intangible asset testing absent any circumstances that warrant testing at another time  we test for goodwill and non amortizing intangible asset impairment as part of our year end closing process 
we considered whether the test should be accelerated during the third quarter of  but concluded based on available information that the fourth quarter remained the appropriate period to perform the test 

table of contents our goodwill testing in  as in prior years  consists of comparing the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units to their carrying amounts  including recorded goodwill 
we have five reporting units  north american retail  north american contract  north american direct  europe and asia  each with some level of goodwill at the time of the test 
we estimate the fair values of each of our reporting units by discounting their projected future cash flows and compare the results to other indicators of value 
because of the extreme economic conditions that existed at and around the time of our test  we were unable to identify meaningful external indicators of value beyond other companies goodwill impairments being recognized and we relied on our discounted cash flow analysis for estimating fair value 
developing these future cash flow projections requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates regarding the sales  gross margin and operating expenses of our reporting units  as well as future economic conditions and the impact of planned business or operational strategies 
as discussed above  we recognized billion of goodwill impairment charges in approximately million of goodwill remains in the north american direct reporting unit 
we also recorded an impairment charge of approximately million on non amortizing trade name intangible assets 
at december   the non amortizing trade name value in europe was valued at million 
while the value of goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets are substantially reduced  should future results or economic events cause a change in our projected cash flows  or should our operating plans or business model change  future determinations of fair value may not support the carrying amount of these assets 
closed store accruals and asset impairments we regularly assess the performance of each retail store against historic patterns and projections of future profitability 
these assessments are based on management s estimates for sales growth  gross margin attainments  and cash flow generation 
if  as a result of these evaluations  management determines that a store will not achieve certain operating performance targets  we may decide to close the store 
when a store is no longer used for operating purposes  we recognize a liability for the remaining costs related to the property  reduced by an estimate of any sublease income 
the calculation of this liability requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the remaining term of the lease including vacancy period  anticipated sublease income  and costs associated with vacating the premises 
with assistance from independent third parties to assess market conditions  we periodically review these judgments and estimates and adjust the liability accordingly 
we plan to close stores through a liquidation process and an additional ten stores  net of relocations  at the end of their lease term in north america 
we also intend to close our retail operations in japan during the lease related costs associated with these closures will be recorded as the facilities close and will be calculated based on our assumption of vacancy period resulting from the slow economic conditions and the sublease rates available in the future 
these commitments with no economic benefit to the company are discounted at the then current credit adjusted discount rate 
future fluctuations in the economy and the market demand for commercial properties could result in material changes in this liability 
costs associated with facility closures are included in store and warehouse operating and selling expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings 
in addition to the decision about whether or not to close a store  store assets are regularly reviewed for recoverability of their carrying amounts 
the recoverability assessment requires judgment and estimates of a store s future cash flows 
historically  it has been our view that new stores require two years to develop a customer base necessary to achieve expected cash flows and we typically do not test for impairment during this early stage 
however  because of the unprecedented economic conditions experienced in  we included recently opened stores in our impairment analysis 
when we return to typical business conditions  we would expect new store operations to follow past patterns and we may return to testing for impairment only after the initial two years of performance 
our impairment analysis builds a cash flow model at the individual store level  beginning with recent store performance and trending the anticipated future results based on chain wide and individual store initiatives 
if the anticipated cash flows of a store cannot support the carrying amount of the store s assets  an impairment charge is recorded to operations as a component of store and warehouse operating and selling expenses 
to the extent that management s estimates of future performance are not realized  future assessments could result in material impairment charges 
our analysis during the third quarter of resulted in an impairment charge of approximately million  or approximately million more than the charge recorded in because of the significant economic downturn experienced during the fourth quarter of  we updated the analysis and recognized an additional million asset impairment charge 
also  because of decisions to close stores in both north america and japan  assets associated with those early closures were written down by approximately million 
these analyses anticipate continued difficult economic conditions throughout and modest recovery beginning in should economic conditions result that are worse than anticipated  additional impairment charges could result 
however  we believe our current assessment includes a reasonable estimation of future conditions 
income taxes income tax accounting requires management to make estimates and apply judgments to events that will be recognized in one period under rules that apply to financial reporting and in a different period in our tax returns 
in particular  judgment is required when estimating the value of future tax deductions  tax credits  and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards nols  as represented by deferred tax assets 
when we believe the realization of all or a portion of a deferred tax asset is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
changes in judgments that increase or decrease these valuation allowances impact current earnings 
in addition to judgments associated with valuation accounts  our current tax provision can be affected by our mix of income and identification or resolution of uncertain tax positions 
because income from domestic and international sources may be taxed at different rates  the shift in mix during a year or over years can cause the effective tax rate to change 
we base our rate during the year on our best estimate of an annual effective rate  and update those estimates quarterly  with the cumulative effect of a change in the anticipated annual rate reflected in the tax provision of that period 
such changes can result in significant interim reporting volatility 

table of contents we file our tax returns based on our best understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations 
however  complexities in the rules and our operations  as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required 
we generally maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority  available review periods expire  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount 
during  we recognized a significant tax charge to reestablish a valuation allowances because of the significant downturn in our operating results 
additional valuation allowances may be required in based on actual operating performance 
our effective tax rate in future periods may be positively or negatively impacted by changes in related judgments or pre tax operations 
significant trends  developments and uncertainties competitive factors over the years  we have seen continued development and growth of competitors in all segments of our business 
in particular  mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs  as well as grocery and drugstore chains  have increased their assortment of home office merchandise  attracting additional back to school customers and year round casual shoppers 
warehouse clubs have expanded beyond their in store assortment by adding catalogs and web sites from which a much broader assortment of products may be ordered 
we also face competition from other office supply stores that compete directly with us in numerous markets 
this competition is likely to result in increased competitive pressures on pricing  product selection and services provided 
many of these retail competitors  including discounters  warehouse clubs  and drug stores and grocery chains  carry basic office supply products 
some of them also feature technology products 
many of them may price certain of these offerings lower than we do  but they have not shown an indication of greatly expanding their somewhat limited product offerings at this time 
this trend towards a proliferation of retailers offering a limited assortment of office products is a potentially serious trend in our industry 
we have also seen growth in competitors that offer office products over the internet  featuring special purchase incentives and one time deals such as close outs 
through our own successful internet and business to business web sites  we believe that we have positioned ourselves competitively in the e commerce arena 
another trend in our industry has been consolidation  as competitors in office supply stores and the copy print channel have been acquired and consolidated into larger  well capitalized corporations 
this trend towards consolidation  coupled with acquisitions by financially strong organizations  is potentially a significant trend in our industry 
we regularly consider these and other competitive factors when we establish both offensive and defensive aspects of our overall business strategy and operating plans 
economic factors our customers in the north american retail division and many of our customers in the north american business solutions division are predominantly small and home office businesses 
accordingly  these customers may continue to curtail their spending in reaction to macroeconomic conditions  such as changes in the housing market and commodity costs  higher credit costs  credit availability  possible recession and other factors 
the downturn in the global economy experienced throughout negatively impacted our sales and profits 
liquidity factors historically  we have generated positive cash flow from operating activities and have had access to broad financial markets that provide the liquidity we need to operate our business 
together  these sources have been used to fund operating and working capital needs  as well as invest in business expansion through new store openings  capital improvements and acquisitions 
however  due to the downturn in the global economy our operating results have diminished 
in september  we entered into a billion asset based credit facility intended to provide liquidity 
the recent distress in the financial markets has resulted in extreme volatility in the capital markets and diminished liquidity and credit availability 
there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be adversely affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy 
in addition  deterioration in our financial results could negatively impact our credit ratings 
the tightening of the credit markets or a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs and make it more difficult for us to access funds  to refinance our existing indebtedness  to enter into agreements for new indebtedness or to obtain funding through the issuance of securities 
if such conditions were to persist  we would seek alternative sources of liquidity but may not be able to meet our obligations as they become due 

table of contents market sensitive risks and positions we have market risk exposure related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year 
interest rate changes on obligations may result from external market factors  as well as changes in our credit rating 
we manage our exposure to market risks at the corporate level 
the portfolio of interest sensitive assets and liabilities is monitored and adjusted to provide liquidity necessary to satisfy anticipated short term needs 
our risk management policies allow the use of specified financial instruments for hedging purposes only  speculation on interest rates or foreign currency rates is not permitted 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on cash equivalents and debt obligations 
the impact on cash and short term investments held at the end of from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would be a decrease in interest income of less than million 
market risk associated with our debt portfolio is summarized below fair risk fair risk dollars in thousands carrying value value sensitivity carrying value value sensitivity million senior notes revolving credit arrangement the risk sensitivity of fixed rate debt reflects the estimated increase in fair value from a basis point decrease in interest rates  calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
the sensitivity of variable rate debt reflects the possible increase in interest expense during the next period from a basis point change in interest rates prevailing at year end 
foreign exchange rate risk we conduct business in various countries outside the united states where the functional currency of the country is not the us dollar 
while we sell directly or indirectly through alliances to customers in countries  the principal operations of our international division are in countries with euro and british pound functional currencies 
we continue to assess our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation against the us dollar 
as of december   a change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in our operating profit of approximately million 
although operations generally are conducted in the relevant local currency  we also are subject to foreign exchange transaction exposure when our subsidiaries transact business in a currency other than their own functional currency 
this exposure arises primarily from inventory purchases in a foreign currency 
the notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain inventory exposures was million at its highest point during also  from time to time we enter into foreign exchange forward transactions to protect against possible changes in exchange rates related to scheduled or anticipated cash movements among our operating entities 
generally  we evaluate the performance of our international businesses by focusing on the local currency results of the business  and not with regard to the translation into us dollars  as the latter is impacted by external factors 
inflation and seasonality although we cannot determine the precise effects of inflation on our business  we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our sales or the results of our operations 
we consider our business to be only somewhat seasonal  with sales lower during the second quarter 
certain working capital components may build and recede during the year reflecting established selling cycles 
additionally  business cycles can and have impacted our operations and financial position when compared to other periods 
new accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements fas 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fas was effective for fiscal years beginning after november  for financial assets and liabilities  as well as for any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in financial statements 
certain aspects of this standard were effective at the beginning of the first quarter of and had no impact on the company 
in november  the fasb provided a one year deferral for the implementation of fas for other nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of the deferred portion of fas will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  business combinations fas r 
this standard retains the fundamental acquisition method of accounting established in statement  however  among other things  fas r requires recognition of assets and liabilities of noncontrolling interests acquired  fair value measurement of consideration and contingent consideration  expense recognition for transaction costs and certain integration costs  recognition of the fair value of contingencies  and adjustments to income tax expense for changes in an acquirer s existing valuation allowances or uncertain tax positions that result from the business combination 
the standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december  and shall be applied prospectively 
however  the standard did not address transition provisions for items such as in progress transactions costs that were capitalized under fas but are considered period costs under fas r 
during the fourth quarter of  we expensed previously deferred costs because they no longer were considered assets that would provide future economic benefit 
the impact was not material to our results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements fas 
this standard changes the way consolidated net income is presented  requiring consolidated net income to report amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest but earnings per share will be based on amounts attributable to the parent 
it also establishes protocol for recognizing certain ownership changes as equity transactions or gain or loss and requires presentation of noncontrolling ownership interest as a component of consolidated equity 
the standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december  and is to be applied prospectively 
we have not yet completed our assessment of the impact fas will have on the presentation of our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
this standard requires enhanced disclosures regarding derivatives and hedging activities  including a the manner in which an entity uses derivative instruments  b the manner in which derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and c the effect of derivative instruments and related hedged items on an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows
