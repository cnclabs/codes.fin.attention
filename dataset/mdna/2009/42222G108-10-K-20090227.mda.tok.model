table of contents managed health care operations we offer a full spectrum of managed health care products and services 
our strategy is to offer to employers and individuals a wide range of managed health care products and services that  among other things  provide comprehensive coverage and manage health care cost increases 
our health plans offer members a wide range of health care services including ambulatory and outpatient physician care  hospital care  pharmacy services  behavioral health and ancillary diagnostic and therapeutic services 
our health plans include a matrix package  which allows members to select their desired coverage from a variety of alternatives 
our principal commercial health products are as follows hmo plans our hmo plans offer comprehensive benefits generally through contracts with participating network physicians  hospitals and other providers 
when an individual enrolls in one of our hmo plans  he or she may select a primary care physician pcp from among the physicians participating in our network 
pcps generally are family practitioners  general practitioners or pediatricians who provide necessary preventive and primary medical care  and are generally responsible for coordinating other necessary health care services  including making referrals to participating network specialists 
we offer hmo plans with differing benefit designs and varying levels of co payments that result in different levels of premium rates 
in california  participating providers are typically contracted through medical groups 
in those cases  enrollees in hmo plans are generally required to secure specialty professional services from physicians in the group  as long as such services are available from group physicians 
ppo plans our ppo plans offer coverage for services received from any health care provider  with benefits generally paid at a higher level when care is received from a participating network provider 
coverage typically is subject to deductibles and co payments or coinsurance 
indemnity plans our indemnity plans offer the member the ability to select any health care provider for covered services 
some care management features may be included in these plans  such as inpatient precertification  disease management programs and benefits for preventive services 
coverage typically is subject to deductibles and coinsurance 
pos plans our pos plans blend the characteristics of hmo and indemnity plans 
members can have comprehensive hmo style benefits for services received from participating network providers with lower co payments particularly within the medical group  but also have coverage  generally at higher co payment or coinsurance levels  for services received outside the network

we provide employers and employees the ability to select and enroll in products with greater managed health care and cost containment elements 
in general  our hmos provide comprehensive health care coverage for a fixed fee or premium that does not vary with the extent or frequency of medical services actually received by the member 
ppo enrollees choose their medical care from a panel of contracting providers or choose a non contracting provider and are reimbursed on a traditional indemnity plan basis after reaching an annual deductible 
pos enrollees choose  each time they receive care  from conventional hmo or indemnity like in network and out of network coverage  with payments and or reimbursement depending on the coverage chosen 
we assume both underwriting and administrative expense risk in return for the premium revenue we receive from our hmo  pos and ppo products

in california  ppgs generally receive a monthly capitation fee for every member assigned to it 
under a capitation fee arrangement  we pay a provider group a fixed amount per member on a regular basis and the provider group accepts the risk of the frequency and cost of member utilization of professional services 
the capitation fee represents payment in full for all medical and ancillary services specified in the provider agreements 
in these capitation fee arrangements  in cases where the capitated ppg cannot provide the health care services needed  such ppgs generally contract with specialists and other ancillary service providers to furnish the requisite services under capitation agreements or negotiated fee schedules with specialists 
outside of california  most of our hmos reimburse physicians according to a discounted fee for service schedule  although several have capitation arrangements with certain providers and provider groups in their market areas 
for services provided under our ppo products and the out of network benefits of our pos products  we ordinarily reimburse physicians pursuant to discounted fee for service arrangements

generally  authorization for such services is for a limited number of appointments and must be renewed by mhn based on medical necessity 
if a member needs inpatient services  mhn maintains a network of approximately  facilities 
in addition to the physicians that are in our networks  we have also entered into agreements with various third parties that have networks of physicians contracted to them third party networks 
in general  under a third party network arrangement  health net is licensed by the third party to access its network providers and pay the claims of these physicians pursuant to the pricing terms of their contracts with the third party network 
hospital relationships our health plan subsidiaries arrange for hospital care primarily through contracts with selected hospitals in their service areas

additional information concerning our business competition we operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry currently subject to significant changes from business consolidations  new strategic alliances  legislative reform and market pressures brought about by a 
table of contents better informed and better organized customer base 
our health plans face substantial competition from for profit and nonprofit hmos  ppos  self funded plans including self insured employers and union trust funds  blue cross blue shield plans  and traditional indemnity insurance carriers  some of which have substantially larger enrollments and greater financial resources than we do 
the development and growth of companies offering internet based connections between health care professionals  employers and members  along with a variety of services  could also create additional competitors 
we believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered  size and quality of provider network  quality of service  responsiveness to user demands  financial stability  comprehensiveness of coverage  diversity of product offerings  and market presence and reputation 
the relative importance of each of these factors and the identity of our key competitors vary by market 
over the past several years  a health plan s ability to interact with employers  members and other third parties including health care professionals via the internet has become a more important competitive factor 
to that end  we have made technology investments to enhance our electronic interactions with third parties 
we believe that we compete effectively against other health care industry participants in the states in which we operate 
our primary competitors in california are kaiser permanente  anthem blue cross of california  unitedhealth group  inc and blue shield of california 
together  these four plans and health net account for a majority of the insured market in california 
kaiser is the largest hmo in california based on number of enrollees and anthem blue cross of california is the largest ppo provider in california based on number of enrollees 
there are also a number of small  regional based health plans that compete with health net in california  mainly in the small business group market segment 
in addition  two of the major national managed care companies  aetna  inc and cigna corp  are active in california 
their respective commercial full risk market share is not as significant as our primary competitors in california and we believe that each remains in california primarily to serve their national  self funded accounts california employees

marketing and sales we market our products and services to individuals and employer groups through inside sales staff  independent brokers  agents and consultants and through the internet 
for our group health business  we market our products and services utilizing a three step process 
we first market to potential employer groups  group insurance brokers and consultants 
we then provide information directly to employees once the employer has selected our health coverage 
finally  we engage members and employers in marketing for member and group retention 
for our small group business  members are enrolled by their employer based on the plan chosen by the employer 
in general  once selected by a large employer group  we solicit enrollees from the employee base directly 
during open enrollment periods when employees are permitted to change health care programs  we use a variety of techniques to attract new enrollees  including  without limitation  direct mail  work day and health fair presentations and telemarketing 
our sales efforts are supported by our marketing division  which engages in product research and development  multicultural marketing  advertising and communications  and member education and retention programs 

table of contents premiums for each employer group are generally contracted on a yearly basis and are payable monthly 
we consider numerous factors in setting our monthly premiums  including employer group needs and anticipated health care utilization rates as forecasted by us based on the demographic composition of  and our prior experience in  our service areas 
premiums are also affected by applicable regulations that in certain circumstances prohibit experience rating of group accounts ie  setting the premium for the group based on its past use of health care services and by state regulations governing the manner in which premiums are structured 
in some of our markets we sell individual policies  which are generally sold through independent brokers and agents 
in some states  carriers are allowed to individually underwrite these policies ie select applicants to whom coverage will be provided and others who are denied  although in other states there may be a requirement of guaranteed issue that restricts the carrier s discretion 
in guaranteed issue states  exclusions for preexisting conditions are generally permitted 
where individual underwriting is permitted  the carrier may  in certain circumstances  rescind the policy coverage if the individual misrepresents his or her medical history in the application process 
see item a 
risk factors proposed federal and state legislation affecting the managed health care industry could adversely affect us and regulatory activities and litigation relating to the rescission of coverage  if resolved unfavorably  could adversely affect us for additional information on health plans right to rescind coverage 
we believe that the importance of the ultimate health care consumer or member in the health care product purchasing process is likely to increase in the future  particularly in light of advances in technology and online resources 
accordingly  we are focusing our marketing strategies on the development of distinct brand identities and innovative product service offerings that will appeal to potential health plan members 
for example  decision power sm is a series of programs designed to more directly involve patients in their health care decisions 
these programs allow our members to access information and consult with health coaches as they are making decisions regarding health care issues 
as more employers begin to offer consumer directed health plans such as health savings accounts hsas and health reimbursement accounts hras  we believe consumers need to be able to learn  plan and make complex decisions regarding their health care 
our website combines access to current health net and vendor content and tools 
consumer directed health care plans  health savings accounts and health reimbursement accounts health savings accounts were created in as part of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of the mma 
hsas are individually owned accounts  similar to an ira or a k retirement plan  that generally allow employees or individuals to make contributions to the account on a pretax basis 
funds in hsas can be used to pay for certain qualified medical expenses such as plan deductibles  co payments and coinsurance on a tax free basis 
hsa funds can be invested and earnings on the investments are generally tax free 
hsas must be used in conjunction with high deductible health plans 
high deductible health plans provide in and out of network benefits and cover a wide range of health care services 
our hsa programs and other consumer driven health care products provide our members with tools to determine what health care services they may need and to estimate how much those services would cost 
we support our consumer directed programs with web based services that assist members in educating themselves about health care 
the web based program includes webmd s subimo estimator tools  decision power sm  prescription drug and hospital comparison tools 
our california health plan also offers a health net health reimbursement account 
an hra is a health reimbursement arrangement funded solely by an employer where the employer reimburses an employee for health expenses not covered by the group health insurance plan such as deductibles and coinsurance amounts 
employees are reimbursed tax free for qualified medical expenses that the employer agrees to reimburse  up to a maximum dollar amount for a coverage period 
subject to the employer s discretion  up to of any unused amounts in the hra at the end of a plan year can be carried forward for reimbursement in subsequent years 

table of contents health net systems consolidation project we continue to work on a number of systems and operational initiatives designed to improve our customer service  realize operational cost efficiencies and improve our decision making capability 
in  we completed our migration to a single medical management platform 
this platform provides operational efficiency in clinical operating units  allows for better multi disciplinary communication amongst our clinicians  and delivers our clinicians improved decision making and patient support tools 
in the third quarter of  we also announced the next stage of our operational strategy 
this stage is a three year effort to consolidate claim platforms across the enterprise and to consolidate service centers and associated staff 
we made significant progress in this arena in  including addressing many of the manual processes and workarounds of having multiple systems 
our progress in it applications and infrastructure outsourcing has been significant  and we continue to make progress on making it easier to do business with health net through the use of more sophisticated electronic channels 
see item a 
risk factors we are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties for risks associated with our outsourcing arrangements 
in addition  we have prioritized projects for with an eye to focusing on those that will bring the greatest immediate benefit 
examples of these projects include an electronic document distribution and print consolidation project  membership and accounting enrollment projects  a claims auto adjudication project and contact center technology and process improvements 
consolidating operations management and continuing to develop more consistent metrics and analytics will greatly increase our efficiency going forward and help us to deliver better service at a lower cost 
the completion of the projects will enable us to improve claim turnaround times  auto adjudication rates  electronic data interchange  and internet capabilities 
however  there are risks associated with these systems efforts 
see item a 
risk factors if we fail to effectively maintain our management information systems  it could adversely affect our business 
medical management we believe that managing health care costs is an essential function for a managed care company 
among the medical management techniques we utilize to contain the growth of health care costs are pre authorization or certification for outpatient and inpatient hospitalizations and a concurrent review of active inpatient hospital stays and discharge planning 
we believe that this authorization process reduces inappropriate use of medical resources and achieves efficiencies in referring cases to the most appropriate providers 
we also contract with third parties to manage certain conditions such as neonatal intensive care unit admissions and stays  as well as chronic conditions such as asthma  diabetes and congestive heart failure 
these techniques are widely used in the managed care industry and are accepted practices in the medical profession 
accreditation we pursue accreditation for certain of our health plans from the national committee for quality assurance ncqa and the utilization review accreditation commission urac 
ncqa and urac are independent  non profit organizations that review and accredit hmos and other healthcare organizations 
hmos that comply with review requirements and quality standards receive accreditation 
the commercial line of business of our arizona  california  connecticut  new jersey and new york hmo subsidiaries have all received ncqa accreditation with a score of excellent  which is the highest score ncqa awards 
hn california s medicare line of business also received ncqa accreditation with a score of excellent 
in addition  hn california s medicaid line of business received ncqa accreditation with a score of commendable  which is customary for first time accreditation 
our mhn subsidiary has received urac accreditation 
government regulation our business is subject to comprehensive federal regulation and state regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business 
these laws and regulations govern how we conduct our businesses and result in additional 
table of contents requirements  restrictions and costs to us 
we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all current state and federal laws and regulations applicable to our businesses 
certain of these laws and regulations are discussed below 
federal legislation and regulation medicare legislation 
on december   the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of mma was signed into law 
this complex legislation made many significant structural changes to the federal medicare program and added a voluntary prescription drug benefit  called a part d benefit  which was made available to medicare beneficiaries starting january  the mma changed the methodology for payment to private plans to a competitive bidding process beginning in for the medicare advantage plans  the federal cms calculates county specific payment rates based on fee for service costs in the county and a legislated formula 
these rates then serve as a benchmark against which we must bid for providing the medicare package of services 
the projected savings from the benchmark rate is used to fund additional benefits to members 
the remaining is retained by cms 
cms then pays us a monthly rate for each enrollee  which is the bid amount  with risk adjustment for that member  plus the of savings if any in the bid 
the risk adjustment factor reflects the member s age  gender and health status 
the mma also authorized regional ppos to serve regions covering the us and its territories  and authorized other products designed to provide a private market option on a broader scale 
our medicare contracts are subject to regulation by cms 
cms has the right to audit hmos and ppos operating under medicare contracts to determine the quality of care being rendered and the degree of compliance with cms contracts and regulations 
in january  we were notified by the cms that we were deficient in certain administrative procedures with respect to our stand alone pdp products  and were directed to cease the sale of such products until resumption of sale was approved by cms 
in march  cms authorized health net to resume sales of its stand alone pdp products 
in late  cms performed a routine audit of health net s medicare advantage operations 
cms found deficiencies in many of the business areas included in the audit 
health net received cms report and corrective action request on february  health net s corrective action plan must be submitted within days of receipt of the corrective action request for review and approval 
see item a 
risk factors federal and state audits  review and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations for a description of the risks associated with this audit 
in september  in part to implement provisions of the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of mippa  cms released final regulations regarding marketing practices of medicare advantage organizations mao and pdp sponsors 
the regulations prohibit certain marketing activities including telemarketing and other unsolicited sales contacts and require that agents and brokers selling medicare advantage and pdp products be state licensed and appointed in accordance with state laws 
health net was required to be in compliance with these provisions when it began marketing activities on october  for plan year enrollments 
cms also released an interim final rule implementing other mippa provisions  including specifying restrictions on compensation to mao and pdp sponsor contracted brokers 
in november  cms released a revised interim final rule on the compensation restrictions 
health net has implemented the requirements of the final regulations and interim final rule 
health net could be subject to monetary and other sanctions from cms in the event of non compliance by health net or its contracted or in house sales producers 
medicaid and related legislation 
federal law has also implemented other health programs that are partially funded by the federal government  such as the medicaid program known as medi cal in california and chip known as healthy families in california 
they are largely regulated and administered by state agencies and thus there are variations in these programs from state to state 
federal funding remains critical to the viability of these programs 
federal law permits the federal government to oversee and  in some cases  to enact  
table of contents regulations and other requirements that must be followed by the states 
medicaid is administered at the federal level by cms  chip is administered by the health resources and services administration  another arm of the department of health and human services 
privacy regulations 
the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information and other data by our businesses is regulated by various laws at the federal  state and local level 
these laws and regulations are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation 
most of those laws are derived from health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa and the privacy provisions in the federal gramm leach bliley financial modernization act of the gramm leach bliley act 
hipaa and the implementing regulations that have been adopted in connection therewith impose obligations for issuers of health insurance coverage and health benefit plan sponsors relating to the privacy and security of electronically transmitted protected health information phi 
the regulations  which relate to privacy  electronic transactions and codesets and security regulations  require health plans  clearinghouses and providers to comply with various requirements and restrictions related to the use  storage and disclosure of phi  adopt rigorous internal procedures to protect phi  create policies related to the privacy of phi and enter into specific written agreements with business associates to whom phi is disclosed 
the regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for non compliance 
we believe we are in compliance with the hipaa privacy regulations  the requirements relating to transactions and codesets and the security regulations 
the gramm leach bliley act generally requires insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares non public personal information with a non affiliated third party 
like hipaa  this law sets a floor standard  allowing states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection 
erisa 
most employee benefit plans are regulated by the federal government under the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa 
employment based health coverage is such an employee benefit plan 
erisa is administered  in large part  by the us department of labor dol 
erisa contains disclosure requirements for documents that define the benefits and coverage 
it also contains a provision that causes federal law to preempt state law in the regulation and governance of certain benefit plans and employer groups  including the availability of legal remedies under state law 
other federal regulations 
we must comply with  and are affected by  laws and regulations relating to the award  administration and performance of us government contracts 
government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and  in some instances  impose added costs on our business 
a violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts 

table of contents state laws and regulations our hmos  insurance companies and behavioral health plan are subject to extensive state regulation 
set forth below are the principal regulatory agencies that govern our health plans and insurance companies

they generally include certain minimum capital and deposit and or reserve requirements  restrictions on dividends and other distributions to the parent corporations and affiliated corporations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources statutory capital requirements 
these financial requirements are subject to change  which may require us to commit additional capital to certain regulated subsidiaries or may limit our ability to move capital through dividends and other distributions 
while there are state by state variations  hmo regulation generally is extremely comprehensive 
among the areas regulated by these hmo regulatory agencies are adequacy of financial resources  network of health care providers and administrative operations  sales and enrollment requirements  disclosure documents and notice requirements  product offerings  including the scope of mandatory benefits and required offerings of benefits that are optional coverages  procedures for member grievance resolution and medical necessity determinations  accessibility of providers  handling of provider claims including out of network claims and adherence to timely and accurate payment and appeal rules  and linguistic and cultural accessibility standards  governance requirements and reporting requirements 
variations in state regulation also arise in connection with the intensity of government oversight 
variations include the need to file or have affirmatively approved certain proposals before use or implementation by the health plan  the degree of review and comment by the regulatory agency  the amount and type of reporting by the 
table of contents health plan to the regulatory agency  the extent and frequency of audit or other examination  and the authority and extent of investigative activity  enforcement action  corrective action authority  and penalties and fines 
our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to legal restrictions on our ability to price some of our products 
some products may be subject to regulatory approval of premium levels 
generally  insurance and hmo laws require premiums to be established at amounts reasonably related to our costs 
pending federal and state legislation there are a number of other legislative initiatives and proposed regulations currently pending or previously proposed at the federal and state levels which could increase regulation of  and costs incurred by  the health care industry 
these measures and other initiatives  if enacted  could have significant adverse effects on our operations 
see item a 
risk factors proposed federal and state legislation and regulations affecting the managed health care industry could adversely affect us 
we cannot predict the outcome of any of the pending legislative or regulatory proposals  nor the extent to which we may be affected by the enactment of any such legislation or regulation 
intellectual property we have registered and maintain various service marks  trademarks and trade names that we use in our businesses  including marks and names incorporating the health net phrase  and from time to time we apply for additional registrations of such marks 
we utilize these and other marks and names in connection with the marketing and identification of products and services

we consider our relations with our employees to be very good 
dependence upon customers the federal government is the only customer of the company s government contracts segment  with premiums and fees accounting for of our government contracts revenue 
in addition  the federal government is a significant customer of the company s health plan services segment as a result of its contract with cms for coverage of medicare eligible individuals  including part d prescription plans  state agencies for federally subsidized medicaid and chip programs  and coverage of federal employees under the federal employees health benefits program 
medicare premiums accounted for of our total premium revenue in shareholder rights plan on july   our board of directors approved the extension of the benefits afforded by our former shareholder rights plan  which expired at the close of business on july   by adopting a new shareholder rights plan pursuant to a rights agreement with wells fargo bank  na the rights agent  dated as of july  the rights agreement

our profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to accurately predict and control health care costs 
a substantial majority of the revenue we receive is used to pay the costs of health care services or supplies delivered to our members 
the total health care costs we incur are affected by the number and type of individual services provided and the cost of each service 
our future profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to accurately predict health care costs and to manage future health care utilization and costs through underwriting criteria  utilization management  product design and negotiation of favorable professional and hospital contracts 
periodic renegotiations of hospital and other provider contracts  coupled with continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups  may result in increased health care costs or limit our ability to negotiate favorable rates 
changes in utilization rates  demographic characteristics  the regulatory environment  health care practices  inflation  new technologies  clusters of high cost cases  continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups and numerous other factors affecting health care costs may adversely affect our ability to predict and control health care costs as well as our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  a large scale public health epidemic could affect our ability to control health care costs 
see large scale public health epidemics and or terrorist activity could cause us to incur unexpected health care and other costs and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents for several years  one of the fastest increasing categories of our health care costs has been the cost of hospital based products and services 
factors underlying the increase in hospital costs include  but are not limited to  the underfunding of public programs  such as medicaid and medicare and the constant pressure that places on rates from commercial health plans  growing rates of uninsured individuals  new technology  state initiated mandates  alleged abuse of hospital chargemasters  an aging population and  under certain circumstances  relatively low levels of hospital competition caused by market concentration 
another significant category of our health care costs is costs of pharmaceutical products and services 
factors affecting our pharmaceutical costs include  but are not limited to  the price of drugs  utilization of new and existing drugs and changes in discounts 
as a measure of the impact of medical cost on our financial results  relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results 
for example  if medical costs increased by without a proportional change in related revenues for our health plan products  our annual net earnings for would have been reduced by approximately million 
the inability to forecast and manage our health care costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs  we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
while health plans compete on the basis of many factors  including service and the quality and depth of provider networks  price will continue to be a significant basis of competition 
our premium revenue is set in advance of the actual delivery of services  and  in certain circumstances  before contracting with providers 
while we attempt to take into account our estimate of expected health care costs over the premium period in setting the premiums we charge or bid  factors such as competition  regulations and other circumstances may limit our ability to fully base premiums on estimated costs 
in addition  many factors may  and often do  cause actual health care costs to exceed those costs estimated and reflected in premiums or bids 
these factors may include increased utilization of services  increased cost of individual services  catastrophes  epidemics  seasonality  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  and insured population characteristics 
our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by significant disparities between the premium increases of our health plans and those of our major competitors or by limitations on our ability to increase or maintain our premium levels 
in  our pricing was  we believe  generally consistent with that of our competitors but there can be no assurance that we will not institute higher premiums in the future 
in addition  we continue to see decreases in our total commercial membership as we seek to improve margins 
any future increase in premiums could result in the loss of members 
additionally  there is always the possibility that adverse risk selection could occur when members who utilize higher levels of health care services compared with the insured population as a whole choose to remain with our health plans rather than risk moving to another plan 
this could cause health care costs to be higher than anticipated and therefore cause our financial results to fall short of expectations 
in the various states in which we do business  premium prices are also constrained by state laws and regulations which restrict the spread between premiums and benefits  such as laws and regulations that require a minimum loss ratio of a certain percentage 
these laws and regulations not only restrict our ability to raise our premiums but also create competitive pressure from some of our competitors who may have lower health care costs than we have and therefore price their premiums at relatively low levels in relation to our cost of care 
our inability to estimate and maintain appropriate levels of reserves for claims may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our reserves for claims are estimates of incurred costs based on various assumptions 
the accuracy of these estimates may be affected by external forces such as changes in the rate of inflation  the regulatory environment  the judicious administration of claims  medical costs and other factors 
included in the reserves for claims are estimates for the costs of services that have been incurred but not reported and for claims received but not 
table of contents processed 
these estimates are continually monitored and reviewed and  as settlements are made or estimates adjusted  differences are reflected in current operations 
given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates  the actual liability could differ significantly from the amounts reserved 
if our actual liability is lower than estimated  it could mean that we set premium prices too high  which could result in a loss of membership 
if our actual liability for claims payments is higher than estimated  it could have a negative impact on our profitability per enrolled member and  subsequently  our earnings per share in any particular quarter or annual period 
for example  in the first quarter of  we announced that our actual liability for claims incurred during the second half of was significantly higher than what we had estimated  primarily as a result of unusual seasonal physician and hospital utilization patterns that emerged as fourth quarter claims from were paid in the first quarter of  and an unusually active flu season 
this development was a contributing factor to the company s first quarter profitability being lower than previous guidance and its decision to lower its full year earnings per diluted share guidance 
our businesses are subject to significant government regulation  which increases our cost of doing business and could adversely affect our ability to grow our businesses 
our businesses are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  financial requirements  licensing requirements  enrollment requirements and periodic examinations by governmental agencies 
these laws and regulations are generally intended to benefit and protect providers and health plan members rather than stockholders of managed health care companies such as health net 
the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change  and may be interpreted in ways that differ from our understanding retroactively based upon the decisions of regulators or courts 
broad latitude is given to the agencies administering these regulations to interpret them and to impose substantial fines when they believe violations have occurred 
regulatory agencies have imposed substantial fines against us in the past  and may impose substantial fines against us in the future if they determine that we have not complied with applicable laws and regulations 
see item legal proceedings for additional information 
existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business and may restrict our revenue and or enrollment growth  and or increase our health care and administrative costs  and or increase our exposure to liability with respect to members  providers or others 
further  individual associates may violate these laws and rules  notwithstanding our internal policies and compliance programs 
our hmo and insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations relating to cash reserves  minimum net worth  premium rates  approval of policy language and benefits  appeals and grievances with respect to benefit determinations  provider contracting  utilization management  issuance and termination of policies  claims payment practices and a wide variety of other regulations relating to the development and operation of health plans 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on us 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statutory capital requirements for additional information 
as a government contractor  we are subject to us government oversight 
the government may ask about and investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations 
depending on the results of those audits and investigations  the government could make claims against us 
under government procurement regulations and practices  a negative determination resulting from such claims could result in a contractor being fined  debarred and or suspended from being able to bid on  or be awarded  new government contracts for a period of time 
in addition  we are subject to state and federal false claims laws that generally prohibit the submission of false claims for reimbursement or payment to government agencies 
courts have imposed substantial fines and penalties against companies found to have violated these laws 
we are also exposed to other risks associated with us government contracting  including dependence upon congressional appropriation and allotment of funds 
in addition  laws or regulations adopted in the future could adversely affect our business 
see proposed federal and state legislation and regulations affecting the managed care industry could adversely affect us 

table of contents delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain governmental approvals  or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities  could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our members  increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted 
our efforts to capitalize on medicare business opportunities could prove to be unsuccessful 
medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business  accounting for approximately of our total premium revenue in and an expected in over the last several years we have significantly expanded our medicare health plans and restructured our medicare program management team and operations to enhance our ability to pursue business opportunities presented by the mma and the medicare program generally 
for example  in we consolidated overall medicare program management under a single executive with responsibility for medicare plan performance and compliance company wide 
all field based sales and servicing operations remain in the local markets close to their customers and distribution channels 
particular risks associated with our provision of medicare part d prescription drug benefits under the mma include potential uncollectibility of receivables  inadequacy of pricing assumptions  inability to receive and process information and increased pharmaceutical costs  as well as the underlying seasonality of this business  and extended settlement periods for claims submissions 
in addition  in connection with our participation in the medicare advantage and part d programs  we regularly record revenues associated with the risk adjustment reimbursement mechanism employed by cms 
this mechanism is designed to appropriately reimburse health plans for the relative health care cost risk of its medicare enrollees 
while we have historically recorded revenue and received payment for risk adjustment reimbursement settlements  there can be no assurance that we will receive payment from cms for the levels of the risk adjustment premium revenue recorded in any given quarter 
on july   the medicare improvement for patients and providers act of mippa became law 
beginning in  mippa may  among other things  significantly reduce funding for medicare advantage programs 
in response to mippa  cms promulgated interim final regulations governing the marketing and sale of medicare advantage and pdp products 
these regulations prohibit certain marketing activities by contracted and in house sales producers  including outbound calling  and place new requirements on amounts and duration of compensation payable to contracted producers 
we could be subject to monetary and other sanctions by cms for a contracted or in house sales producer s violation of these regulations 
in addition  the new presidential administration has made it clear that health reform  including the reduction of medicare expenditures  is an important priority 
if the cost and complexity of any changes to the medicare program exceed our expectations or prevent effective program implementation  if the government alters or further reduces funding of medicare programs  if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants  if cms suspended our ability to market  or enroll members in  our medicare products  or if we are not successful in winning contract renewals or new contracts under the mma s competitive bidding process  our current medicare business and our ability to expand our medicare operations could be materially and adversely affected  and we may not be able to realize any return on our investments in medicare initiatives 
see federal and state audits  review and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations for information on the results of our recent cms audit 
a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
approximately of our annual revenues relate to federal  state and local government health care coverage programs  such as medicare  medicaid and tricare 
all of the revenues in our government contracts segment come from the federal government 
under government funded health programs  the government payor typically determines premium and reimbursement levels 
if the government payor reduces premium or reimbursement levels or increases them by less than our costs increase  and we are unable to make offsetting adjustments through supplemental premiums and changes in benefit plans  we could be adversely 
table of contents affected 
contracts under these programs are generally subject to frequent change  including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the revenue received by us or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs 
changes of this nature could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
changes to government health care coverage programs in the future may also affect our willingness to participate in these programs 
states periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid 
currently  many states are experiencing budget deficits  and some states have reduced or have begun to reduce  or have proposed reductions in  payments to medicaid managed care providers 
for example  in july  the state of california implemented a reduction in the state s medi cal reimbursement rates 
this rate reduction had an adverse impact on our pretax income for and was one of the factors contributing to our lowered full year earnings per share guidance for any additional significant reduction in payments received in connection with medicaid could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  states can impose requirements on medicaid programs that make continued operations not feasible 
for example  in early we completed our transition out of the medicaid program in connecticut due to the state requiring medicaid contractors to publicly disclose certain proprietary and trade secret information and persistent underfunding of the program 
the amount of government receivables set forth in our consolidated financial statements represents our best estimate of the government s liability to us under tricare and other federal government contracts 
in general  government receivables are estimates and subject to government audit and negotiation 
in addition  inherent in government contracts are an uncertainty of and vulnerability to disagreements with the government 
final amounts we ultimately receive under government contracts may be significantly greater or less than the amounts we initially recognize on our financial statements 
health care operations under our tricare north contract are scheduled to conclude on march  unless extended by the department of defense 
we are currently negotiating an extension of the tricare north contract with the department of defense for an additional one year option period  which  if exercised would extend the contract until march  on june   we submitted our proposal to the department of defense for the third generation of tricare managed care support contracts referred to as t and  following discussions with the government regarding our proposal  we submitted our final proposal on january  the t contract is scheduled to be awarded on or before june   with implementation of the new contracts scheduled to begin on april  given the effective date of the new contracts  we currently believe that the department of defense will extend our current tricare north contract for one year 
there are competitive proposals from other companies for the t contract 
if the contract is not extended  and we are not awarded a new tricare contract  or if the terms and conditions of a new contract were significantly changed  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
proposed federal and state legislation and regulations affecting the managed health care industry could adversely affect us 
the united states congress and federal and state regulatory agencies frequently consider legislative proposals and regulatory initiatives which  if enacted  could materially affect the managed health care industry and the regulatory environment 
these proposals have included initiatives which  if enacted  could have material adverse effects on our operations  including subjecting us to additional litigation risk  regulatory compliance costs and restrictions on our business operations 
such measures have proposed  among other things  to restrict or eliminate health insurers and health plans in the marketplace  restrict a health insurer or health plan s profitability or regulate the medical cost ratio  require health plans to pay significantly higher taxes  or reduce government funding of government sponsored health programs in which we participate  
table of contents mandate certain benefits and administrative or other services that could increase the cost of healthcare or administrative services  or restrict our right to manage the member s care through authorization requirements  requirements of medical necessity  or formularies for covered pharmaceuticals  restrict our ability to contract with and manage access to providers and provider groups  enhance certain provider payments or appeal rights  or restrict our ability to select and terminate providers  mandate certain grievance and appeal rights for our members or providers  including establishment of third party reviews of certain care decisions  and regulate the individual coverage market by restricting or mandating premium levels  restrict our underwriting discretion  or restrict our ability to rescind coverage based on a member s misrepresentations and omissions 
recently  the issue of affordable health insurance and the challenge of insuring the uninsured have generated much public attention 
in states where we conduct business  governors and state legislatures are considering various proposals to cover the uninsured 
in addition  the new president and his administration  as well as members of congress  have indicated that they intend to enact federal health reform measures in the near future 
proposals under consideration at both the state and federal levels include  but are not limited to  restructuring the health insurance market to mandate coverage  guaranteeing insurance in the individual market  merging individual and small group markets  placing a cap on loss ratios or premiums or otherwise taking steps to expand access to health insurance in a manner that does not allow for management of risk  and taking steps to limit insurance company profitability 
we cannot predict the outcome of the legislative and regulatory proposals described above or any other such legislative or regulatory proposals  nor the extent to which we may be affected by the enactment of any such legislation or regulations 
such legislation or regulation  including measures that would cause us to change our current manner of operation or increase our exposure to liability  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and ability to compete in our industry 
we may experience losses as a result of the regional concentration of our business 
our business operations are concentrated in the northeast in the states of connecticut  new york and new jersey and in the states of california  arizona and oregon 
our california operations represented approximately of our total revenue in in late  we announced that  among other strategic alternatives  we are considering a divestiture of our northeast and arizona businesses 
if we divest our northeast and arizona businesses  the geographic concentration of our remaining business operations will increase 
due to this concentration in a small number of states  and  in particular  california  we are exposed to the risk of a deterioration in our financial results arising from a significant economic downturn in one or more of these states 
the state of california is experiencing a significant budget shortfall  which may lead to cuts in spending for services and the significant deterioration of economic conditions in california 
if economic conditions in any of these states significantly worsen  we may experience a reduction in existing and new business  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if any one of our health plans experiences significant losses  our consolidated results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
losses of accounts or deterioration in margins in any one of the states in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
federal and state audits  review and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we have been and  in some cases  currently are  involved in various federal and state governmental audits  reviews and investigations 
these include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by cms  state insurance and health and welfare departments and others pertaining to financial performance  market conduct and regulatory compliance issues 
such audits  reviews and investigations could result in the loss of 
table of contents licensure or the right to participate in certain programs  or the imposition of civil or criminal fines  penalties and other sanctions 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 
we have entered into consent agreements relating to  and in some instances have agreed to pay fines in connection with  several recent audits and investigations 
many regulatory audits  reviews and investigations in recent years have focused on the timeliness and accuracy of claims payments by managed care companies and health insurers 
our subsidiaries have been the subject of audits  reviews and investigations of this nature 
depending on the circumstances and the specific matters reviewed  regulatory findings could require remediation of claims payment errors and payment of penalties of material amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
beginning in november   cms performed routine audits of certain of our medicare advantage  pffs and pdp products  and found deficiencies in many of the business areas included in the review 
on february   we received the audit report and corrective action request from cms  and we have days to submit our corrective action plan to cms for review and approval 
if cms is not satisfied with our corrective action plan  or if it believes that the deficiencies are substantial and or repeat deficiencies  it could levy enforcement actions  including financial penalties and or the suspension of marketing and enrollment into our medicare products 
if cms were to impose substantial financial penalties and or suspend the marketing of and enrollment into our medicare products for a significant period of time in the future  it could have a material adverse effect on our medicare business 
on february   the new york attorney general nyag announced that his office was conducting an industry wide investigation into the manner in which health insurers calculate usual  customary and reasonable charges for purposes of reimbursing members for out of network medical services 
the nyag s office issued subpoenas to health insurance companies  including us  in connection with this investigation 
see item legal proceedings for additional detail regarding the nyag s investigation 
on january   the nyag announced that  as a result of his investigation  his office had entered into a settlement agreement with united healthgroup  inc  which owns and operates the ingenix database used by most health plans  including us  to price out of network claims 
at the time of the announcement of the settlement with united  the nyag indicated his intent to continue his investigation with respect to other health insurers 
in the meantime  the connecticut attorney general has also been investigating health plans reimbursement of out of network services 
on march   we received a request for voluntary production from the connecticut attorney general that seeks information similar to that subpoenaed by the nyag 
we are in the process of responding to the request and are cooperating with the connecticut attorney general as appropriate in his investigation 
there can be no assurance that other state attorneys general will not take actions similar to those taken by the nyag and the connecticut attorney general 
in addition  from time to time  agencies of the us government investigate whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with regulations applicable to government contractors 
government investigations of us  whether relating to government contracts or conducted for other reasons  could result in administrative  civil or criminal liabilities  including repayments  fines or penalties being imposed upon us  or could lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracting  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
regulatory activities and litigation relating to the rescission of coverage  if resolved unfavorably  could adversely affect us 
in our individual business in certain states  persons applying for insurance policies are required to provide information about their medical history as well as that of family members for whom they are seeking coverage 
these applications are subjected to a formal underwriting process to determine whether the applicants present an acceptable risk 
if coverage is issued and the health plan or insurer subsequently discovers that the applicant 
table of contents materially misrepresented their or their family members medical history  the health plan or insurer has the legal right to rescind the policy in accordance with applicable legal standards 
although rescission has long been a legally authorized practice  the decisions of health plans to rescind coverage and decline payment to treating providers  as well as the procedures used to do so  have recently generated public attention  particularly in california 
as a result  there have been both legislative and regulatory actions  as well as significant litigation  in connection with this issue 
on october   the california department of managed health care dmhc and the california department of insurance doi announced that they would be issuing joint regulations that would restrict the ability of health plans and insurers to rescind a member s coverage and deny payment to treating providers 
the dmhc has issued draft proposed regulations but has not formally promulgated any regulations to date 
the doi has not issued any proposed regulations and at this time it is not known whether or when either agency will issue regulations 
as of january   health plans and insurers in california  under certain defined circumstances  are obligated to pay providers for services they have rendered despite the rescission of a member s policy 
in october   the dmhc initiated a survey of health net of california s activities regarding the rescission of policies for the period january  through june  following completion of the survey  on may   health net of california entered into a settlement agreement with the dmhc 
see item legal proceedings litigation relating to rescission of policies for information regarding the details of the settlement agreement 
failure to substantially implement the actions set forth in the corrective action plan will subject health net of california to a potential additional penalty of up to million 
in april   the doi commenced an audit of health net life insurance company s rescission practices and related claims settlement practices for the period january  through february  on september   health net life entered into a settlement agreement with the doi which resolves all doi matters regarding health net life s rescission practices from january to date 
see item legal proceedings litigation relating to rescission of policies for information regarding the details of the settlement agreement 
failure to substantially comply with the settlement agreement subjects health net life to a potential additional monetary penalty of up to million 
we are also party to arbitrations and litigation  including a putative class action  in which rescinded members allege that we unlawfully rescinded their coverage 
the lawsuits generally seek reimbursement for the cost of medical services that were not paid as a result of the rescission  and also seek to recover for emotional distress  attorneys fees and punitive damages 
one of these arbitrations was decided in and resulted in an award paid to the claimant of approximately million 
recent court of appeal decisions in california adverse to health plans and insurers have increased the risks associated with rescissions of policies based on applications containing material misrepresentations of medical history  and may make it more difficult to rescind policies in the future 
on february   the los angeles city attorney filed a complaint against us relating to our underwriting practices and rescission of certain individual policies 
the complaint sought equitable relief and civil penalties for  among other things  alleged false advertising  violations of unfair competition laws and violations of the california penal code 
on february   health net entered into settlement agreements resolving both the putative class action and the action filed by the los angeles city attorney 
see item legal proceedings litigation relating to rescission of policies for additional information regarding these settlement agreements 
other government agencies  including the attorney general of california  have indicated that they are investigating  or may be interested in investigating  rescissions and related activities 
we cannot predict the outcome of the anticipated regulatory proposals described above  nor the extent to which we may be affected by the enactment of those or other regulatory or legislative activities relating to rescissions 
such legislation or regulation  including measures that would cause us to change our current manner of operation or increase our exposure to liability  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and ability to compete in our industry 
similarly  given the complexity and scope 
table of contents of rescission lawsuits  their final outcome cannot be predicted with any certainty 
it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period our results of operations could be adversely affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of these cases 
we face risks related to litigation  which  if resolved unfavorably  could result in substantial penalties and or monetary damages  including punitive damages 
in addition  we incur material expenses in the defense of litigation and our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected if we fail to accurately project litigation expenses 
we are subject to a variety of legal actions to which any corporation may be subject  including employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  wage and hour claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims  fraud and misrepresentation claims  shareholder suits  including suits for securities fraud  and intellectual property and real estate related disputes 
in addition  we incur and likely will continue to incur potential liability for claims related to the insurance industry in general and our business in particular  such as claims by members alleging failure to pay for or provide health care  poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged  improper rescission  termination or non renewal of coverage and insufficient payments for out of network services  claims by employer groups for return of premiums  and claims by providers  including claims for withheld or otherwise insufficient compensation or reimbursement  claims related to self funded business  and claims related to reinsurance matters 
such actions can also include allegations of fraud  misrepresentation  and unfair or improper business practices and can include claims for punitive damages 
also  there are currently  and may be in the future  attempts to bring class action lawsuits against various managed care organizations  including us 
in some of the cases pending against us  substantial non economic or punitive damages are also being sought 
recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of the types of claims we face 
there is a risk that we could incur substantial legal fees and expenses  including discovery expenses  in any of the actions we defend in excess of amounts budgeted for defense 
plaintiffs attorneys have increasingly used expansive electronic discovery requests as a litigation tactic 
responding to these requests  the scope of which may exceed the normal capacity of our historical systems for archiving and organizing electronic documents  may require application of significant resources and impose significant costs on us 
in certain cases  we could also be subject to awards of substantial legal fees and costs to plaintiffs counsel 
we cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuit with certainty  and we are incurring material expenses in the defense of litigation matters  including without limitation  substantial discovery costs 
while we currently have insurance policies that may provide coverage for some of the potential liabilities relating to litigation matters  there can be no assurance that coverage will be available for any particular case or liability 
insurers could dispute coverage or the amount of insurance could not be sufficient to cover the damages awarded or settlement amounts 
in addition  certain liabilities such as punitive damages  may not be covered by insurance 
insurance coverage for all or certain types of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future or the deductible on any such insurance coverage could be set at a level that would result in us effectively self insuring cases against us 
the deductible on our errors and omissions e o insurance has reached such a level 
given the amount of the deductible  the only cases which would be covered by our e o insurance are those involving claims that substantially exceed our average claim values and otherwise qualify for coverage under the terms of the insurance policy 
we regularly evaluate litigation matters pending against us  including those described in note to our consolidated financial statements  to determine if settlement of such matters would be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 
the costs associated with any such settlement could be substantial and  in certain cases  such as with the mccoy case  could result in an earnings charge in any particular quarter in which we enter into a settlement agreement 
although we have recorded litigation reserves which represent our best estimate on probable losses  both known and incurred but not reported  our recorded reserves might prove to be inadequate to cover an adverse result or settlement for extraordinary matters  such as the matters described in note 
table of contents therefore  costs associated with the various litigation matters to which we are subject and any earnings charge recorded in connection with a settlement agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to maintain good relations with the physicians  hospitals and other providers that we contract with  our profitability could be adversely affected 
we contract with physicians  hospitals and other providers as a means to assure access to health care services for our members  to manage health care costs and utilization and to better monitor the quality of care being delivered 
in any particular market  providers could refuse to contract with us  demand higher payments or take other actions  including litigation  which could result in higher health care costs  less desirable products for customers and members  disruption to provider access for current members or to support growth  or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations and multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or even monopolies 
some of these providers may compete directly with us 
if these providers refuse to contract with us or utilize their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage  our ability to market our products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 
we contract with professional providers in california primarily through capitation fee arrangements 
under a capitation fee arrangement  we pay a provider group a fixed amount per member on a regular basis and the provider group accepts the risk of the frequency and cost of member utilization of professional services 
provider groups that enter into capitation fee arrangements generally contract with specialists and other secondary providers  and may contract with primary care physicians  to provide services 
the inability of provider groups to properly manage costs under capitation arrangements can result in their financial instability and the termination of their relationship with us 
a provider group s financial instability or failure to pay secondary providers for services rendered could lead secondary providers to demand payment from us  even though we have made our regular capitated payments to the provider group 
depending on state law  we could be liable for such claims 
in california  the liability of our hmo subsidiaries for unpaid provider claims has not been definitively settled 
there can be no assurance that we will not be liable for unpaid provider claims 
there can also be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services  maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with secondary providers  the failure of any of which could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to members and our operations 
some providers that render services to our members and insureds that have coverage for out of network services are not contracted with our plans and insurance companies 
in those cases  there is no pre established understanding between the provider and the plan about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider  rather  the plan s obligation is to reimburse the member based upon the terms of the member s plan 
in some states and product lines  the amount of reimbursement is defined by law or regulation  but in most instances it is established by a standard set forth in the plan that is not clearly translated into dollar terms  such as usual  customary and reasonable 
in such instances providers may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with the plan or balance bill our member 
regulatory authorities in various states may also challenge the manner in which we reimburse members for services performed by non contracted providers 
for example  as described in more detail in item legal proceedings proceedings relating to claims payment practices  the nyag announced in february that his office is in the process of conducting such an investigation  and settlements entered into by other health plans with the nyag in the wake of this investigation have involved certain payments by those plans 
as a result of litigation or regulatory activity  we may have to pay providers additional amounts or reimburse members for their out of pocket payments 
the uncertainty about our financial obligations for such services and the possibility of subsequent adjustment of our original payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in addition  provider groups and hospitals that do contract with us have in certain situations commenced litigation and or arbitration proceedings against us to recover amounts they allege to be underpayments due to 
table of contents them under their contracts with us 
we believe that provider groups and hospitals have become increasingly sophisticated in their review of claim payments and contractual terms in an effort to maximize their payments from us and have increased their use of outside professionals  including accounting firms and attorneys  in these efforts 
these efforts and the litigation and arbitration that result from them could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
if the current unfavorable economic conditions continue or further deteriorate  it could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
recent market and economic conditions in the united states have been challenging and unprecedented 
continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation  energy costs  rising unemployment rates  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit and other capital  the us mortgage market  consumer spending and a declining real estate market have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the us economy and this is expected to continue going forward 
these extreme events could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
these market conditions expose us to a number of risks  including risks associated with the potential financial instability of our customers 
if our customer base experiences cash flow problems or other financial difficulties  it could  in turn  adversely impact membership in our plans 
for example  our customers may modify  delay or cancel plans to purchase our products  or may make changes in the mix of products purchased from us 
if our customers experience financial issues  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us  or may reduce their workforce  resulting in a decline in membership in our products 
further  our customers or potential customers may force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service to retain or obtain their business 
the adverse economic conditions could also cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary  employee funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs 
a significant decline in membership in our plans and the inability of current and or potential customers to pay their premiums as a result of unfavorable economic conditions may adversely affect our business  including our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
higher unemployment rates and significant employment layoffs and downsizings may also impact the number of enrollees in managed care programs and the profitability of our operations 
if economic conditions significantly deteriorate and unemployment rates continue to rise  we may experience a reduction in existing and new business  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
an extended economic downturn could adversely affect state and federal budgets  resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs  including medicare  medicaid and chip 
a reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to payments already negotiated and or received from the government and could adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
in addition  state and federal budgetary pressures could cause new or a higher levels of assessments or taxes for our commercial programs  such as surcharges on select fee for service and capitated medical claims or premium taxes on health maintenance organizations  and could adversely affect our results of operations 
our forecasts and other forward looking statements are based on a variety of assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties 
our performance may not be consistent with these forecasts and forward looking statements 
from time to time in press releases and otherwise  we publish forecasts or other forward looking statements regarding our future results  including estimated revenues  net earnings and other operating and financial metrics 
any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions 
these assumptions are subject to significant 
table of contents uncertainties  and  as a matter of course  any number of them may prove to be incorrect 
for example  in  we lowered our full year earnings per share guidance in the first  second and third quarter  which had a significant negative impact on our full year results 
the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors  including those described in this annual report  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the volatility in the financial markets and challenging economic conditions may make it particularly difficult to forecast our future performance 
as a result  we cannot assure that our performance will meet any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse 
you are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions  but instead are encouraged to utilize the entire mix of publicly available historical and forward looking information  as well as other available information affecting us  our services  and our industry when evaluating our forecasts and other forward looking statements relating to our operations and financial performance 
we have a material amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness  or need to refinance existing indebtedness  in the future  which may adversely affect our operations 
our indebtedness includes million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and million in borrowings under a financing facility which will amortize over a period ending december for a description of our senior notes and our financing facility  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital structure 
in addition  to provide liquidity  we have a million five year revolving credit facility that expires in june as of december   million was outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
we may incur additional debt in the future 
our existing indebtedness  and any additional debt we incur in the future through drawings on our revolving credit facility or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt  which would reduce funds available to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general operating requirements  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 
we continually evaluate options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness 
our ability to obtain any financing  whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise  and the terms of any such financing are dependent on  among other things  our financial condition  financial market conditions within our industry and generally  credit ratings and numerous other factors 
recently  credit markets have experienced unusual uncertainty  and liquidity and access to capital markets have tightened 
see adverse conditions in the credit markets may materially affect our ability to obtain credit 
consequently  in the event we need to access the credit markets to refinance our debt  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing on terms and within a time acceptable to us it could  in addition to other negative effects  have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  ability to compete or ability to comply with regulatory requirements 
adverse conditions in the credit markets may materially affect our ability to obtain credit 
the us and global capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption 
concern about the stability of the markets generally has lead many lenders to reduce and in some cases cease to provide funding to borrowers 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  they may materially and adversely affect our ability to access additional capital to meet liquidity needs  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the current economic environment and volatility in the financial markets could have an adverse impact on the value of our investment portfolio and our goodwill which could  in turn  have a negative effect on our results of operations and stockholders equity 
our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of available for sale investment securities such as interest yielding debt securities of varying maturities 
as of december   our available for sale investment securities were billion 
the value of fixed income securities is highly sensitive to fluctuations in short and long term interest rates  with the value decreasing as such rates increase and increasing as such rates decrease 
these securities may also be negatively impacted by illiquidity in the market 
we closely monitor the fair values of our investment securities and regularly evaluate them for any other than temporary impairments 
we have the intent and ability to hold our investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amount invested 
the current economic environment and recent volatility of the us and global capital markets have negatively impacted the liquidity of investments  such as our debt securities  and a worsening of credit market disruptions or sustained market downturns could have additional negative effects on the liquidity and value of our investment assets 
in addition  such volatility has increased the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets 
in the third quarter of  we recognized a million loss from other than temporary impairments in our available for sale investments and money market fund 
over time  the economic and capital market environment may further deteriorate or provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities  which could change our judgment regarding the impairment of certain investments 
this could result in realized losses relating to other than temporary declines being charged against future income 
given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved  there is continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and material other than temporary impairments may result in realized losses in future periods  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition

in addition  our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to state laws and regulations that govern the types of investments that are allowable and admissible in those subsidiaries portfolios 
there can be no assurance that our investment assets will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of these investments 
changes in the value of our investment assets  as a result of interest rate fluctuations  illiquidity or otherwise  could have a negative affect on our stockholders equity 
in addition  if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis  it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
the economic environment and crisis in the financial markets also resulted in significant fluctuations in our market capitalization during as a result of the decline in our market capitalization  we updated our annual goodwill impairment test as of december  no impairment was found but if our stock price does not stabilize or if our market capitalization continues to decline  we could be required to update our goodwill impairment test in future quarters 
depending on the results of any such impairment test  we could be required to take an impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of our goodwill 
if we were required to take such a charge  it would be non cash and would not affect our liquidity  tangible equity or regulatory capital levels but could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations 
downgrades in our debt ratings  should they occur  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
claims paying ability  financial strength  and debt ratings by nationally recognized rating agencies are increasingly important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and health benefits companies 
ratings information by nationally recognized rating agencies is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry 
we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important 
table of contents factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers 
in addition  our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly  our cost of capital  and our amortizing financing facility contains covenants requiring that we maintain certain public debt ratings 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital structure amortizing financing facility for additional information on our amortizing financing facility 
each of the rating agencies reviews our ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future 
our ratings reflect each rating agency s independent opinion of our financial strength  operating performance  ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders and other factors 
downgrades in our ratings  should they occur  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are a holding company and a substantial amount of our cash flow is generated by our subsidiaries 
our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends and maintenance of minimum levels of capital 
as a holding company  our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our consolidated operations and own substantially all of our consolidated assets 
consequently  our cash flow and our ability to pay our debt depends  in part  on the amount of cash that we receive from our subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries ability to make any payments to us will depend on their earnings  business and tax considerations  legal and regulatory restrictions and economic conditions 
in addition  in certain states our regulated subsidiaries are subject to risk based capital requirements  known as rbc 
these laws require our regulated subsidiaries to report their results of risk based capital calculations to the departments of insurance in their state of domicile and the national association of insurance commissioners 
failure to maintain the minimum rbc standards could subject certain of our regulated subsidiaries to corrective action  including increased reporting and or state supervision 
in addition  in most states  we are required to seek prior approval before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts 
if our regulated subsidiaries are restricted from paying us dividends or otherwise making cash transfers to us  it could have material adverse effect on our results of operations and health net  inc s free cash flow

on december   we entered into a million financing facility 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital structure for additional information regarding our revolving credit facility and our financing facility 
our revolving credit facility and our financing facility require us to comply with various covenants that impose restrictions on our operations  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make investments or other restricted payments  sell or otherwise dispose of assets and engage in other activities 
our revolving credit facility and our financing facility also require us to comply with certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
our financing facility has a covenant requiring us to maintain certain minimum public debt ratings 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital structure amortizing financing facility for details regarding the threshold ratings we are required to maintain under the financing facility 
the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facility and our financing facility could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies 
in addition  any failure by us to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under the revolving credit facility  our financing facility  and  in some circumstances  under the indenture governing our senior notes  which  in any case  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

table of contents the markets in which we do business are highly competitive 
if we do not design and price our products competitively  our membership and profitability could decline 
we are in a highly competitive industry 
many of our competitors may have certain characteristics  capabilities or resources  such as greater market share  superior provider and supplier arrangements and existing business relationships  that give them an advantage in competing with us 
these competitors include hmos  ppos  self funded employers  insurance companies  hospitals  health care facilities and other health care providers 
in addition  other companies may enter our markets in the future 
in addition  financial services or other technology based companies could enter the market and compete with us on the basis of their streamlined administrative functions 
the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors 
there is a risk that our customers may decide to perform for themselves functions or services currently provided by us  which could result in a decrease in our revenues 
in addition  our providers and suppliers may decide to market products and services to our customers in competition with us 
in recent years  there has been significant merger and acquisition activity in our industry and in industries that act as our suppliers  such as the hospital  physician  pharmaceutical and medical device industries 
this activity may create stronger competitors and or result in higher health care costs 
in addition  our contracts with government agencies  such as our tricare north contract  are frequently up for re bid and the loss of any significant government contract to a competitor could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that there is strong competition or that competition intensifies in any market  our ability to retain or increase customers  our revenue growth  our pricing flexibility  our control over medical cost trends and our marketing expenses may all be adversely affected 
nearly every major managed care organization has launched  announced or is developing hsa compatible high deductible health plans 
we have launched hsa programs in our northeast  arizona  california and oregon health plans 
our hsa programs represented a very small percentage of our total revenue in some of our large competitors  such as aetna and blue cross blue shield plans  have made large investments in  and heavily marketed  their consumer directed health plans and have gained more enrollment in many markets across the country 
if their enrollment trend continues  it may widen the competitive gap between us over the next several years 
if we fail to design  maintain and effectively market consumer directed health care programs that are attractive to consumers and  as a result  are unable to achieve a competitive market share in the consumer directed care category  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have historically experienced significant turnover in senior management and recently reorganized our management structure 
if we are unable to manage the succession of our key executives  it could adversely affect our business 
we have experienced a high turnover in our senior management team in recent years and in late reorganized our management structure 
although we have succession plans in place and have employment arrangements with our key executives  these do not guarantee that the services of these key executives will continue to be available to us 
we would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for future turnover of our senior management team 
if we fail to effectively maintain our management information systems  it could adversely affect our business 
our business depends significantly on effective information systems 
the information gathered and processed by our management information systems assists us in  among other things  pricing our services  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  processing provider claims  billing our customers on a timely basis 
table of contents and identifying accounts for collection 
our customers and providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verification  claims status and other information 
we have many different information systems for our various businesses and these systems require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
moreover  our merger  acquisition and divestiture activity requires transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information management systems 
health net s operations strategy team is currently reviewing options for transitioning to a single technology platform companywide to gain operational and cost efficiencies 
we believe that by consolidating our current systems  we will gain operational and cost efficiencies 
transitioning to a single in house system and utilizing varying levels of system outsourcing are options currently under consideration by management 
see item business additional information concerning our business health net systems consolidation project for additional information regarding this consolidation project 
any difficulty or unexpected delay associated with the transition to or from information systems  any inability or failure to properly maintain management information systems  or any inability or failure to successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs  could result in operational disruptions  loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers  disputes with customers and providers  regulatory problems  significant increases in administrative expenses and or other adverse consequences 
in addition  we may  from time to time  obtain significant portions of our systems related or other services or facilities from independent third parties  which may make our operations vulnerable to adverse effects if such third parties fail to perform adequately 
see we are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties 
we are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties 
we contract with independent third party vendors who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions 
these third party vendors include  but are not limited to  information technology system providers  medical management providers  claims administration providers  billing and enrollment providers  call center providers and specialty service providers 
our arrangements with third party vendors may make our operations vulnerable if those third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us  including their obligations to maintain and protect the security and confidentiality of our information and data  as a result of our failure to adequately monitor and regulate their performance  changes in the vendors operations or financial condition or other matters outside of our control 
violations of laws or regulations governing our business by third party vendors could increase our exposure to liability or otherwise increase the costs associated with the operation of our business 
in addition  to the extent we outsource selected services or selected functions to third parties in foreign jurisdictions  we could be exposed to risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states  including international economic and political conditions  additional costs associated with complying with foreign laws and fluctuations in currency values 
in  we entered into an outsourcing agreement the it outsourcing agreement with international business machines corporation ibm and two separate outsourcing agreements collectively  the applications and claims outsourcing agreements with cognizant technology solutions us corporation cognizant 
under the terms of the it outsourcing agreement  ibm will  among other things  provide us with data center services  it security management services  technical support services  administrative support services and  via an ibm partner  voice and data network services 
under the terms of the applications and claims outsourcing agreements  cognizant will  among other things  provide application development  testing and monitoring services  application maintenance and support services  project management services  claims adjudication  adjustment  audit and process improvement services 
we will retain responsibility for the payment of claims and the development of claims processing policies 
the it outsourcing agreement and the applications and claims outsourcing agreements  as well as any of our other outsourcing arrangements  could increase our exposure to the risks outlined above 
in addition  we may not fully realize the anticipated economic and other benefits from our outsourcing projects or other relationships 
table of contents we enter into with third party vendors  as a result of regulatory restrictions on outsourcing or otherwise 
this could result in substantial costs or other operational or financial problems that could adversely impact our results of operations 
acquisitions  divestitures and other significant transactions may adversely affect our business 
we continue to evaluate the profitability realized or likely to be realized by our existing businesses and operations 
from time to time we review  from a strategic standpoint  potential acquisitions and divestitures in light of our core businesses and growth strategies 
the success of any such acquisition or divestiture depends  in part  upon our ability to identify suitable buyers or sellers  negotiate favorable contractual terms and  in many cases  obtain governmental approval 
for acquisitions  success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into the company s existing operations 
if we are unable to consummate  successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings  our financial results could be adversely affected 
in addition  we may  from time to time  divest businesses that are less of a strategic fit for the company or do not produce an adequate return 
in november  we announced that  among other strategic alternatives  we are considering a divestiture of our northeast and arizona businesses 
we may not be able to divest our northeast and arizona businesses or may not be able to do so on terms that are favorable to us 
failure to divest or execute another strategic alternative following such an announcement could adversely impact our ability to operate those businesses profitably 
should a divestiture of the northeast and arizona businesses occur  our profitability may be impacted by either gains or losses on the sales of those businesses or lost operating income or cash flows from those businesses 
further  in the event the structure of the transaction results in continuing obligations by the buyer to us or our customers  a buyer s inability to fulfill these obligations could lead to future financial loss on our part 
in addition  any divestiture could result in significant asset impairment charges  including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
these potential acquisitions or divestitures present financial  managerial and operational challenges  including diversion of management attention from existing businesses  difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems  increased expenses  assumption of unknown liabilities  indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers 
we must comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure compliance by our business associates with hipaa 
in december  the department of health and human services promulgated regulations under hipaa related to the privacy and security of electronically transmitted protected health information phi 
the regulations require health plans  clearinghouses and providers to comply with various requirements and restrictions related to the use  storage  transmission and disclosure of phi  adopt rigorous internal procedures to safeguard phi  and enter into specific written agreements with business associates to whom phi is disclosed 
the regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for non compliance 
in addition  the regulations could expose us to additional liability for  among other things  violations of the regulations by our business associates  including the third party vendors involved in our outsourcing projects 
although our contracts with business associates provide for appropriate protections of phi  we may have limited control over the actions and practices of our business associates 
compliance with hipaa and other state and federal privacy and security regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes  the development of new administrative processes and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates 
negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products and services 
managed health care companies have received and continue to receive negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry 
for example  the company and the managed health care industry have been subject to negative publicity surrounding practices in connection with the rescission of individual health insurance policies 
in addition  health care and related health care reform proposals have been and are expected 
table of contents to continue to be the subject of intense media attention  especially since the new presidential administration has announced that federal health reform is one of its top priorities 
such political discourse can often generate publicity that portrays managed care in a negative light 
our marketing efforts may be affected by the amount of negative publicity to which the industry has been subject  as well as by speculation and uncertainty relating to merger and acquisition activity among companies in our industry  including speculation about a possible divestiture of our northeast and arizona businesses 
speculation  uncertainty or negative publicity about us  our industry or our lines of business could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products or services  require changes to our products or services  or stimulate additional legislation  regulation  review of industry practices or litigation that could adversely affect us 
if we are unable to manage our general and administrative expenses  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
the level of our administrative expenses can affect our profitability  and administrative expense increases are difficult to predict 
while we attempt to effectively manage such expenses  including through the development of online functionalities and other projects designed to create administrative efficiencies  increases in staff related and other administrative expenses may occur from time to time due to business or product start ups or expansions  growth  membership declines or changes in business  difficulties or delays in projects designed to create administrative efficiencies  acquisitions  reliance on outsourced services  regulatory requirements  including compliance with hipaa regulations  or other reasons 
for example  in  our administrative expenses increased as we continued to support expected commercial growth 
in addition  in november  we announced a reorganization plan to enhance efficiency and achieve general and administrative cost savings 
the reorganization is ongoing and is intended to enable us to streamline our operations  including consolidating technology platforms  combining duplicative administrative and operational functions and outsourcing certain operations where appropriate 
we are targeting annual savings of million in general and administrative expenses by in connection with the reorganization 
however  there can be no assurance that the reorganization will produce the anticipated savings or that the reorganization will not significantly disrupt operations thereby negatively impacting our financial performance 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage our administrative expenses  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we depend  in part  on independent brokers and sales agents to market our products and services  and recent regulatory investigations have focused on certain brokerage practices  including broker compensation arrangements and bid quoting practices 
we market our products and services both through sales people employed by us and through independent sales agents 
independent sales agents typically do not work with us on an exclusive basis and may market health care products and services of our competitors 
we face intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent sales agents and we cannot assure you that these agents will continue to market our products at a reasonable cost 
although we have a number of sales employees and agents  if key sales employees or agents or a large subset of these individuals were to leave us  our ability to retain existing customers and members could be impaired 
there have been a number of investigations and enforcement actions against insurance brokers and insurers over the last several years regarding allegedly inappropriate or undisclosed payments made by insurers to brokers for the placement of insurance business 
for example  cms has increased its scrutiny of insurance brokers and insurers regarding allegedly improper sales and marketing practices in connection with the sale of medicare products 
while we are not aware of any unlawful practices by the company or any of our agents or brokers in connection with the marketing and sales of our products and services  investigations by the new york attorney general  new york department of insurance  cms and other regulators  as well as regulatory changes initiated in several states in response to allegedly inappropriate broker conduct and broker payment practices  could result in changes in industry practices that could have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products

there can be no assurance that the trading price of our common stock will vary in a manner consistent with the variation in the hmo index or the standard poor s mid cap index of which our common stock is also a component 
the market prices of our common stock and the securities of certain other publicly traded companies in our industry have shown significant volatility and sensitivity in response to many factors  including public communications regarding managed care  legislative or regulatory actions  health care reform litigation or threatened litigation  health care cost trends  pricing trends  competition  earnings  receivable collections or membership reports of particular industry participants  and market speculation about or actual acquisition activity 
additionally  adverse developments affecting any one of the companies in our sector could cause the price of our common stock to weaken  even if those adverse developments do not otherwise affect us 
there can be no assurances regarding the level or stability of our share price at any time or the impact of these or any other factors on our stock price 
if we are required to publicly disclose information regarding our provider reimbursement rates and preferred drug list or other trade secret information for our programs  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in  following a determination that the connecticut freedom of information act was applicable to managed care organizations participating in the connecticut medicaid program  the state of connecticut announced that it was considering making the state s freedom of information act applicable to other state programs  such as programs for the uninsured and the state employee health benefits program 
if we are required to publicly disclose information regarding our provider reimbursement rates  preferred drug lists or other trade secret information  it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to contract with providers and compete effectively in the marketplace 
large scale public health epidemics and or terrorist activity could cause us to incur unexpected health care and other costs and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
an outbreak of a pandemic disease and or future terrorist activities  including bio terrorism  could materially and adversely affect the us economy in general and the health care industry specifically 
depending on the government s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurance companies  a large scale public health epidemic or future acts of bio terrorism could lead to  among other things  increased use of health care services  disruption of information and payment systems  increased health care costs due to increased in patient and out patient hospital costs and the cost of any anti viral medication used to treat affected people 
natural disasters  including earthquakes  fires and floods  could severely damage or interrupt our systems and operations and result in an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
natural disasters such as fire  flood  earthquake  tornado  power loss  virus  telecommunications failure  break in or similar event could severely damage or interrupt our systems and operations  result in loss of data  and or delay or impair our ability to service our members and providers 
we have in place a disaster recovery plan which is intended to provide us with the ability to maintain fully redundant systems for our operations in the event of a natural disaster utilizing various alternate sites provided by a national disaster recovery vendor 
however  there can be no assurance that such adverse effects will not occur in the event of a disaster 
any such disaster or similar event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

item legal proceedings 
litigation related to the sale of businesses amcareco litigation we are a defendant in two related litigation matters pending in louisiana and texas state courts  both of which relate to claims asserted by three separate state receivers overseeing the liquidation of three health plans in louisiana  texas and oklahoma that were previously owned by our former subsidiary  foundation health corporation fhc  which merged into health net  inc in january in  fhc sold its interest in these plans to amcareco  inc amcareco 
we retained a minority interest in the three plans after the sale 
thereafter  the three plans became known as amcare of louisiana amcare la  amcare of oklahoma amcare ok and amcare of texas amcare tx 
in  three years after the sale of the plans to amcareco  each of the amcare plans was placed under state oversight and ultimately into receivership 
the receivers for each of the amcare plans filed suit against us contending that  among other things  we were responsible as a controlling 
table of contents shareholder of amcareco following the sale of the plans for post acquisition misconduct by amcareco and others that caused the three health plans to fail and ultimately be placed into receivership 
on june   a consolidated trial of the claims asserted against us by the three receivers commenced in state court in baton rouge  louisiana 
the claims of the receiver for amcare tx were tried before a jury and the claims of the receivers for the amcare la and amcare ok were tried before the judge in the same proceeding 
on june   the jury considering the claims of the receiver for amcare tx returned a verdict against us in the amount of million  consisting of million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages 
the court later reduced the compensatory and punitive damages awards to million and million  respectively  and entered judgments against us in those amounts 
the proceedings regarding the claims of the receivers for amcare la and amcare ok concluded on july  on november   the court issued separate judgments on those claims that awarded million in compensatory damages to amcare la and million in compensatory damages to amcare ok  respectively 
the court later denied requests by amcare la and amcare ok for attorneys fees and punitive damages 
we thereafter appealed both judgments  and the receivers for amcare la and amcare ok each appealed the orders denying them attorneys fees and punitive damages 
on december   the court of appeal issued its judgment on each of the appeals 
it reversed in their entirety the trial court s judgments in favor of the amcare tx and amcare ok receivers  and entered judgment in our favor against those receivers  finding that the receivers claims failed as a matter of law 
as a result  those receivers cross appeals were rendered moot 
the court of appeal also reversed the trial court judgment in favor of the amcare la receiver  with the exception of a single breach of contract claim  on which it entered judgment in favor of the amcare la receiver in the amount of million 
on january   the three receivers filed a request for rehearing by the court of appeal 
on february   the court of appeal denied the request for a rehearing 
the receivers have days from that date to file an application for a writ with the louisiana supreme court 
in light of the original trial court judgments against us  on november   we filed a complaint in the us district court for the middle district of louisiana and simultaneously filed an identical suit in the th judicial district court in east baton rouge parish seeking to nullify the three judgments that were rendered against us on the grounds of ill practice which resulted in the judgments entered 
we have alleged that the judgments and other prejudicial rulings rendered in these cases were the result of impermissible ex part contacts between the receivers  their counsel and the trial court during the course of the litigation 
preliminary motions and exceptions have been filed by the receivers for amcare tx  amcare ok and amcare la seeking dismissal of our claim for nullification on various grounds 
the federal judge dismissed health net s federal complaint and health net appealed to the us fifth circuit court of appeals 
on july   the fifth circuit issued an opinion affirming the district court s dismissal of the federal complaint  albeit on different legal grounds from those relied upon by the district court 
the state court nullity action has been stayed pending the resolution of health net s jurisdictional appeal in the federal action and has remained stayed during the pendency of the appeal of the underlying judgments 
these proceedings are subject to many uncertainties  and  given their complexity and scope  their outcome  including the outcome of any appeal  cannot be predicted at this time 
it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period our results of operations  cash flow and or liquidity could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of these proceedings depending  in part  upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period 
however  at this time  management believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
litigation relating to rescission of policies in recent years  there has been growing public attention  especially in california  to the practices of health plans and health insurers involving the rescission of members policies for misrepresenting their health status on 
table of contents applications for coverage 
on october   the california department of managed health care dmhc and the california department of insurance doi announced their intention to issue joint regulations limiting the rights of health plans and insurers to rescind coverage 
the dmhc has issued draft proposed regulations but has not formally promulgated any regulations to date 
the doi has not issued any proposed regulations 
in addition  effective january   newly enacted legislation in california requires health plans and insurers to pay health care providers who  under certain circumstances  have rendered services to members whose policies are subsequently rescinded 
the issue of rescissions has also attracted increasing media attention  and both the dmhc and the doi have been conducting surveys of the rescission practices of health plans  including ours 
other government agencies  including the attorney general of california  are investigating  or have indicated that they may be interested in investigating  rescissions and related activities 
on october   the dmhc initiated a survey of health net of california s activities regarding the rescission of policies for the period january  through june  following completion of the survey  on may   health net of california entered into a settlement agreement with the dmhc 
the settlement agreement requires health net of california to pay a  administrative fine  offer future coverage to all hmo enrollees who had coverage rescinded from january  through may   offer those enrollees an opportunity to participate in an expedited review process where the enrollee could seek to resolve claims for out of pocket medical expenses and other damages incurred as a result of the rescission  and file a corrective action plan for various internal procedural changes by june  health net of california filed the corrective action plan by the due date and has commenced implementation of the corrective action plan 
failure to substantially implement the actions set forth in the corrective action plan will subject health net of california to a potential penalty of up to million 
on april   the doi commenced an audit of health net life insurance company s rescission practices and related claims settlement practices for the period january  through february  on september   health net life entered into a settlement agreement with the doi  which resolves all doi matters regarding health net life s rescission practices from january to date 
under the settlement agreement  health net life paid a million penalty in and agreed to certain corrective actions  including offering future coverage to all rescinded ppo insureds and offering an opportunity to participate in an expedited review process that allows former insureds to seek to resolve their claims for damages incurred as a result of their rescission 
on october   health net life filed a corrective action proposal for various procedure changes 
failure to substantially comply with the settlement agreement subjects health net life to a potential additional monetary penalty of up to million 
we are also party to arbitrations and litigation  including a putative class action lawsuit filed in april in los angeles superior court  in which rescinded members allege that we unlawfully rescinded their coverage 
the lawsuits generally seek to recover the cost of medical services that were not paid for as a result of the rescission  and in some cases they also seek damages for emotional distress  attorney fees and punitive damages 
on february   the los angeles city attorney filed a complaint against health net in the los angeles superior court relating to our underwriting practices and rescission of certain individual policies 
the complaint sought equitable relief and civil penalties for  among other things  alleged false advertising  violations of unfair competition laws and violations of the california penal code 
on february   we entered into settlement agreements that resolved both the putative class action and the los angeles city attorney s lawsuit 
under the terms of the settlement agreements  we agreed to pay a total of million to class members individuals rescinded between february  and february   in accordance with an agreed upon distribution formula 
the class action settlement agreement also provides that we will reimburse class members for certain out of pocket expenses related to covered medical services that occurred between the time of their original enrollment and the date of their rescission  and we will also hold them harmless for certain unpaid bills for such services 
under the agreement  our reimbursement and hold harmless obligations are capped at a total of million in the aggregate 
we will also pay attorney fees of approximately million 
under the terms of the two agreements  we also agreed that we would not engage in any rescissions in california until january   unless legislation or regulations governing the process for rescissions is enacted  or we implement a third party 
table of contents independent review process that is not objected to by the dmhc or the doi 
the agreement with the city attorney also provides that we will pay a million civil penalty  as well as contribute  as cy pres payments to specified non profit organizations that support childrens healthcare 
we also agreed as part of the settlements to offer coverage to class members on a going forward basis without medical underwriting  similar to the offer we agreed to make as part of our settlements with the dmhc and doi 
on february   the court gave preliminary approval of the settlements and scheduled a final approval hearing for may  class members will be given notice of the settlement  and an opportunity to opt out of the agreement  or to file objections to the settlement  which will be considered by the court at the final approval hearing 
all of the settlement amounts have been fully accrued for as of december  we cannot predict the outcome of the anticipated regulatory proposals described above  nor the extent to which we may be affected by the enactment of those or other regulatory or legislative activities relating to rescissions 
such legislation or regulation  including measures that would cause us to change our current manner of operation or increase our exposure to liability  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and ability to compete in our industry 
similarly  given the complexity and scope of rescission lawsuits  their final outcome cannot be predicted with any certainty 
it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period our results of operations could be adversely affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of these cases 
proceedings relating to claims payment practices on march   we entered into a final settlement agreement with the plaintiffs in the mccoy  wachtel and scharfman lawsuits  which were nationwide class actions principally relating to our out of network claims payment practices 
we are currently in the process of implementing the terms of the settlement agreement 
we were also the subject of a regulatory investigation conducted by the new jersey department of banking and insurance dobi related principally to the timeliness and accuracy of our claims payment practices for services rendered by out of network providers in new jersey 
on august   we entered into a consent order with dobi and agreed to remediate certain claims and pay a million fine 
we completed the remediation of the claims as of august  in the third quarter of  we recorded a million charge relating to the settlement of the mccoy  wachtel and scharfman cases  including the million fine arising from the consent order with dobi 
on february   the new york attorney general nyag announced that his office was conducting an industry wide investigation into the manner in which health insurers calculate usual  customary and reasonable charges for purposes of reimbursing members for out of network medical services 
the nyag s office issued subpoenas to health insurance companies  including us  in connection with this investigation 
as described by the nyag in a press conference on february   the threatened claims appear to be similar in part to those asserted by the plaintiffs in the mccoy  wachtel and scharfman cases described above 
we are in the process of responding to the subpoena and are cooperating with the nyag as appropriate in his investigation 
on january   the nyag announced that  as a result of his investigation  his office had entered into a settlement agreement with unitedhealth group  inc  which owns and operates ingenix  the company that supplied the database used by many health insurers  including us  to determine certain out of network reimbursements 
under the terms of the settlement  united will discontinue its ownership and operation of those databases  and will pay million towards creation of a new database to be owned and operated by a non profit organization in new york 
since the announcement of the agreement with united  the nyag has reached agreements with some other health plans  under which they agreed to make payments towards the creation of the database and  in some instances  agree to utilize the database if certain conditions are satisfied 
at the time of the announcement of the settlement  the nyag indicated his intent to continue his investigation with respect to other health insurers 
in the meantime  the connecticut attorney general has also been investigating health plans reimbursement of out of network services 
on march   we received a request for voluntary production from the connecticut attorney general that sought information similar to that subpoenaed by the nyag 
we are in the process of responding to the request and are cooperating with the connecticut attorney general as appropriate in his investigation 

table of contents miscellaneous proceedings in the ordinary course of our business operations  we are also subject to periodic reviews by various regulatory agencies with respect to our compliance with a wide variety of rules and regulations applicable to our business  including  without limitation  rules relating to pre authorization penalties  payment of out of network claims and timely review of grievances and appeals  which may result in remediation of certain claims and the assessment of regulatory fines or penalties 
in addition  in the ordinary course of our business operations  we are also party to various other legal proceedings  including  without limitation  litigation arising out of our general business activities  such as contract disputes  employment litigation  wage and hour claims  real estate and intellectual property claims  claims brought by members seeking coverage or additional reimbursement for services allegedly rendered to our members  but which allegedly were either denied  underpaid or not paid  and claims arising out of the acquisition or divestiture of various business units or other assets 
we are also subject to claims relating to the performance of contractual obligations to providers  members  employer groups and others  including the alleged failure to properly pay claims and challenges to the manner in which we process claims 
in addition  we are subject to claims relating to the insurance industry in general  such as claims relating to reinsurance agreements and rescission of coverage and other types of insurance coverage obligations 
these other regulatory and legal proceedings are subject to many uncertainties  and  given their complexity and scope  their final outcome cannot be predicted at this time 
it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period our results of operations and cash flow could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of any or all of these other regulatory and legal proceedings depending  in part  upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period 
however  at this time  management believes that the ultimate outcome of all of these other regulatory and legal proceedings that are pending  after consideration of applicable reserves and potentially available insurance coverage benefits  should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
potential settlements we regularly evaluate litigation matters pending against us  including those described above  to determine if settlement of such matters would be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 
the costs associated with any such settlement could be substantial and  in certain cases  could result in a significant earnings charge in any particular quarter in which we enter into a settlement agreement 
we have recorded reserves and accrued costs for future legal costs for certain significant matters described above 
these reserves and accrued costs represent our best estimate of probable loss  including related future legal costs for such matters  both known and incurred but not reported  although our recorded amounts might ultimately be inadequate to cover such costs 
therefore  the costs associated with the various litigation matters to which we are subject and any earnings charge recorded in connection with a settlement agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview general we are an integrated managed care organization that delivers managed health care services through health plans and government sponsored managed care plans 
we are among the nation s largest publicly traded managed health care companies 
our mission is to help people be healthy  secure and comfortable 
we provide health benefits to approximately million individuals across the country through group  individual  medicare including the medicare prescription drug benefit commonly referred to as part d  medicaid  tricare and veterans affairs programs 
our behavioral health services subsidiary  managed health network mhn  provides behavioral health  substance abuse and employee assistance programs to approximately million individuals  including our own health plan members 
our subsidiaries also offer managed health care products related to prescription drugs  and offer managed health care product coordination for multi region employers and administrative services for medical groups and self funded benefits programs 
how we report our results we currently operate within two reportable segments  health plan services and government contracts  each of which is described below 
our health plan services reportable segment includes the operations of our commercial  medicare including the medicare prescription drug benefit commonly referred to as part d and medicaid health plans  the operations of our health and life insurance companies  and our behavioral health and pharmaceutical services subsidiaries 
we have approximately million members  including medicare part d members and administrative services only aso members in our health plan services segment 
our government contracts segment includes our government sponsored managed care federal contract with the us department of defense the department of defense under the tricare program in the north region and other health care related government contracts 
under the tricare contract for the north region  we provide health care services to approximately million military health system mhs eligible beneficiaries active duty personnel and tricare medicare dual eligible beneficiaries  including million tricare eligibles for whom we provide health care and administrative services and million other mhs eligible beneficiaries for whom we provide aso 
we also provide behavioral health services to military families under the department of defense military family life counseling contract 
how we measure our profitability our profitability depends in large part on our ability to  among other things  effectively price our health care products  manage health care costs  including reserve estimates and pharmacy costs  contract with health care providers  attract and retain members  and manage our general and administrative g a and selling expenses 
in addition  factors such as regulation  competition and general economic conditions affect our operations and profitability 
the effect of escalating health care costs  as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers  may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business  and may have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we measure our health plan services segment profitability based on medical care ratio mcr and pretax income 
the mcr is calculated as health plan services expense excluding depreciation and amortization divided by health plan services premiums 
the pretax income is calculated as health plan services premiums and administrative services fees and other income less health plan services expense and g a and other net expenses 
see results of operations table of summary financial information for a calculation of our mcr and results of operations health plan services segment results for a calculation of our pretax income 

table of contents health plan services premiums include health maintenance organization hmo  point of service pos and preferred provider organization ppo premiums from employer groups and individuals and from medicare recipients who have purchased supplemental benefit coverage which premiums are based on a predetermined prepaid fee  medicaid revenues based on multi year contracts to provide care to medicaid recipients  and revenue under medicare risk contracts  including medicare part d  to provide care to enrolled medicare recipients 
medicare revenue can also include amounts for risk factor adjustments and additional premiums that we charge in some places to members who purchase our medicare risk plans see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the amount of premiums we earn in a given year is driven by the rates we charge and enrollment levels 
administrative services fees and other income primarily include revenue for administrative services such as claims processing  customer service  medical management  provider network access and other administrative services 
health plan services expense includes medical and related costs for health services provided to our members  including physician services  hospital and related professional services  outpatient care  and pharmacy benefit costs 
these expenses are impacted by unit costs and utilization rates 
unit costs represent the health care cost per visit  and the utilization rates represent the volume of health care consumption by our members 
g a expenses include those costs related to employees and benefits  consulting and professional fees  marketing  premium taxes and assessments  occupancy costs and litigation and regulatory related costs 
such costs are driven by membership levels  introduction of new products  system consolidations  outsourcing activities and compliance requirements for changing regulations 
these expenses also include expenses associated with corporate shared services and other costs to reflect the fact that such expenses are incurred primarily to support the health plan services segment 
selling expenses consist of external broker commission expenses and generally vary with premium volume 
we measure our government contracts segment profitability based on government contracts cost ratio and pretax income 
the government contracts cost ratio is calculated as government contracts cost divided by government contracts revenue 
the pretax income is calculated as government contracts revenue less government contracts cost 
see results of operations table of summary financial information for a calculation of our government contracts cost ratio and results of operations government contracts segment results for a calculation of our pretax income 
government contracts revenue is made up of two major components health care and administrative services 
the health care component includes revenue recorded for health care costs for the provision of services to our members  including paid claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims ibnr expenses for which we are at risk  and underwriting fees earned for providing the health care and assuming underwriting risk in the delivery of care 
the administrative services component encompasses fees received for all other services provided to both the government customer and to beneficiaries  including services such as medical management  claims processing  enrollment  customer services and other services unique to the managed care support contract with the government 
government contracts revenue and expenses include the impact from underruns and overruns relative to our target cost under the applicable contracts see note to our consolidated financial statements 
recent developments during the fourth quarter of  we announced that the company s board of directors directed our chief operating officer to assume responsibility for all operational matters of the company  and our president and chief executive officer to focus his efforts on the company s strategy  with particular emphasis on how best to deploy the company s assets in the current competitive and economic environment 
this process includes reviewing our health plans in arizona  connecticut  new jersey and new york to determine their long term strategic position in the company as well as a possible divestiture among other strategic alternatives 
we are continuing with this process and no definitive decisions have been made at this time

table of contents liquidity and capital resources market and economic conditions in the us  recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented in recent history and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth through the third and fourth quarters of continued concerns about the us mortgage market  declining real estate market  and the availability of credit have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the us economy 
in september  added concerns fueled by the federal government conservatorship of the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and the federal national mortgage association fannie mae  the declared bankruptcy of lehman brothers holdings inc  the us government provided loan to american international group inc and other federal government interventions in the us credit markets led to increased market uncertainty and instability in both us and international capital and credit markets 
these conditions  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has caused many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
while we have not experienced a reduction in the capital and funding available to us at this time  continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to timely replace maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  if our customer base experiences cash flow problems and other financial difficulties  it could  in turn  adversely impact membership in our plans 
for example  our customers may modify  delay or cancel plans to purchase our products  may reduce the number of individuals to whom they provide coverage  or may make changes in the mix or products purchased from us 
in addition  if our customers experience financial issues  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us 
further  our customers or potential customers may force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service to retain or obtain their business 
a significant decline in membership in our plans and the inability of current and or potential customers to pay their premiums as a result of unfavorable conditions may adversely affect our business  including our revenues  profitability and cash flow

the maximum amount available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility is reduced by the dollar amount of any outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   we had outstanding an aggregate of million in letters of credit and outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility of million 
as a result  the maximum amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility was million as of december   and no amount had been drawn on the letters of credit 
as of february   we had million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
statutory capital requirements certain of our subsidiaries must comply with minimum capital and surplus requirements under applicable state laws and regulations  and must have adequate reserves for claims 
management believes that as of december   all of our active health plans and insurance subsidiaries met their respective regulatory requirements  in all material respects 
by law  regulation and governmental policy  our health plan and insurance subsidiaries  which we refer to as our regulated subsidiaries  are required to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth 
the minimum statutory net worth requirements differ by state and are generally based on balances established by statute  a percentage of annualized premium revenue  a percentage of annualized health care costs  or risk based capital rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements are based on guidelines established by the national association of insurance commissioners 
the rbc formula  which calculates asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk  business risk and other factors  generates the authorized control level acl  which represents the minimum amount of net worth believed to be required to support the regulated entity s business 
for states in which the rbc requirements have been adopted  the regulated entity typically must maintain the greater of the company action level rbc  calculated as of the acl  or the minimum statutory net worth requirement calculated pursuant to pre rbc guidelines 
because our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to their state regulators overall oversight authority  some of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital and surplus in excess of the rbc requirement  even though rbc has been adopted in their states of domicile 
we generally manage our aggregate regulated subsidiary capital above of acl  although rbc standards are not yet applicable to all of our regulated subsidiaries 
at december   we had sufficient capital to exceed this level 
as necessary  we make contributions to and issue standby letters of credit on behalf of our subsidiaries to meet rbc or other statutory capital requirements under state laws and regulations 
during the year ended december   we made capital contributions of million to various subsidiaries to maintain rbc or other statutory capital requirements 
health net  inc made a capital contribution in the amount of million to one of its subsidiaries to meet rbc or other statutory capital requirements under state laws and regulations thereafter through february  
table of contents legislation has been or may be enacted in certain states in which our subsidiaries operate imposing substantially increased minimum capital and or statutory deposit requirements for hmos in such states 
such statutory deposits may only be drawn upon under limited circumstances relating to the protection of policyholders 
as a result of the above requirements and other regulatory requirements  certain subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans or other transfers of cash to their parent companies 
such restrictions  unless amended or waived or unless regulatory approval is granted  limit the use of any cash generated by these subsidiaries to pay our obligations 
the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance departments is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus  statutory income and unassigned surplus 
contractual obligations our significant contractual obligations as of december  are summarized below for the years ending december total thereafter dollars in millions long term debt principal long term debt interest floating rate borrowings principal floating rate borrowings interest valuation of interest rate swap contracts operating leases long term purchase obligations fin liabilities  including interest and penalties b deferred compensation a estimated future payments for pension and other benefits a a represents estimated future payments from through b the fin obligations shown above represent uncertain tax positions expected to be paid within the reporting periods presented 
in addition to the obligations shown above  approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as a liability in accordance with fin  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled or paid 
operating leases we lease office space under various operating leases 
certain leases are cancelable with substantial penalties 
see item properties for additional information regarding our leases 
on march   we sold our acre commercial campus in shelton  connecticut the shelton property to the dacourt group  inc dacourt and leased it back from dacourt under an operating lease agreement for an initial term of ten years with an option to extend for two additional terms of ten years each 
the total future minimum lease commitments under the lease are approximately million 
effective january   we entered into an operating lease agreement to renew our leased office space in woodland hills  california for our corporate headquarters 
the new lease is for a term of years and has provisions for space reduction at specific times over the term of the lease  but it does not provide for complete cancellation rights 
the total future minimum lease commitments under the lease are approximately million 

table of contents long term purchase obligations we have entered into long term agreements to purchase various services  which may contain certain termination provisions and have remaining terms in excess of one year as of december  we have entered into long term agreements to receive services related to pharmacy benefit management  pharmacy claims processing services and health quality risk scoring enhancement services with external third party service providers 
the remaining terms are approximately three years for each of these contracts 
termination of these agreements is subject to certain termination provisions 
the total future minimum commitments under these agreements are million and are included in the table above 
on august   we entered into a five and one half year agreement with international business machines corporation ibm to outsource our it infrastructure management services including data center services  it security management and help desk support 
the total future minimum commitments under the agreement are million 
on september   we entered into a five year and three month agreement with cognizant technology solutions us corporation cognizant to outsource our software applications development and management activities to cognizant 
under the terms of the agreement  cognizant will  among other things  provide us with services including the following application development  testing and monitoring services  application maintenance and support services  project management services and cross functional services 
the total future commitments under the agreement are million 
we have excluded from the table above amounts already recorded in our current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we have also excluded from the table above various contracts we have entered into with our health care providers  health care facilities  the federal government and other contracts that we have entered into for the purpose of providing health care services 
we have excluded those contracts that allow for cancellation without significant penalty  obligations that are contingent upon achieving certain goals and contracts for goods and services that are fulfilled by vendors within a short time horizon and within the normal course of business 
on january   we also entered into a five year and two months agreement with cognizant to outsource a substantial portion of our claims processing activities to cognizant 
under the terms of the agreement  cognizant will  among other things  provide us with claims adjudication  adjustment  audit and process improvement services 
the total future commitments under the agreement are million 
the future contractual obligations in the contractual obligations table are estimated based on information currently available 
the timing of and the actual payment amounts may differ based on actual events 
surety bonds in order to secure judgment pending our appeal in the amcareco litigation  we obtained surety bonds totaling million  which are further secured by letters of credit issued in december in the amounts of million

off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined under regulation s k a and the instructions thereto 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
principal areas requiring the use of estimates include revenue recognition  health care costs  reserves for contingent liabilities  amounts receivable or payable under government contracts  goodwill and recoverability of long lived assets and investments and income taxes 
accordingly  we consider accounting policies on these areas to be critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
a significant change in any one of these amounts may have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that we use in preparing our financial statements is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
health plan services health plan services premium revenues include hmo  pos and ppo premiums from employer groups and individuals and from medicare recipients who have purchased supplemental benefit coverage for which premiums are based on a predetermined prepaid fee  medicaid revenues based on multi year contracts to provide care to medicaid recipients  and revenue under medicare risk contracts including part d to provide care and services to enrolled medicare recipients 
revenue is recognized in the month in which the related enrollees are entitled to health care services 
premiums collected in advance of the month in which enrollees are entitled to health care services are recorded as unearned premiums 
approximately   and in  and  respectively  of our health plan services premium revenues were generated under medicare and medicaid medi cal contracts 
these revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by the respective fiscal intermediaries 
laws and regulations governing these programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation 
as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount 
our medicare contracts are with cms 
cms deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors 
the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history would indicate that they are expected to have higher medical costs 
under this risk adjustment methodology  cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient  hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings 
we and the health care providers collect  compile and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines 
we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms 
from time to time  we make adjustments to our revenues based on retroactivity 
these retroactivity adjustments reflect changes in the number of enrollees subsequent to when the revenue is billed 
we estimate the amount of future retroactivity each period and accordingly adjust the billed revenue 
the estimated adjustments are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the volume of contract renewal activity during the period and other information 
we refine our estimates and methodologies as information on actual retroactivity becomes available 
on a monthly basis  we estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables to reflect allowances for doubtful accounts 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based on the creditworthiness of our customers  our historical collection rates and the age of our unpaid balances 
during this process  we also assess the recoverability of the receivables  and an allowance is recorded based upon their net realizable value 
those receivables that are deemed to be uncollectible  such as receivables from bankrupt employer groups  are fully written off against their corresponding asset account  with a debit to the allowance to the extent such an allowance was previously recorded 

table of contents reserves for claims and other settlements include reserves for claims incurred but not reported claims ibnr and received but unprocessed claims  and other liabilities including capitation payable  shared risk settlements  provider disputes  provider incentives and other reserves for our health plan services reporting segment 
as of december   of reserves for claims and other settlements were attributed to claims reserves 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of changes in the reserve for claims 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for claims primarily by using standard actuarial developmental methodologies 
this method is also known as the chain ladder or completion factor method 
the developmental method estimates reserves for claims based upon the historical lag between the month when services are rendered and the month claims are paid while taking into consideration  among other things  expected medical cost inflation  seasonal patterns  product mix  benefit plan changes and changes in membership 
a key component of the developmental method is the completion factor which is a measure of how complete the claims paid to date are relative to the estimate of the claims for services rendered for a given period 
while the completion factors are reliable and robust for older service periods  they are more volatile and less reliable for more recent periods since a large portion of health care claims are not submitted to us until several months after services have been rendered 
accordingly  for the most recent months  the incurred claims are estimated from a trend analysis based on per member per month claims trends developed from the experience in preceding months 
this method is applied consistently year over year while assumptions may be adjusted to reflect changes in medical cost inflation  seasonal patterns  product mix  benefit plan changes and changes in membership 
an extensive degree of actuarial judgment is used in this estimation process  considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  and the estimates are highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and payment patterns and medical cost trends 
as such  the completion factors and the claims per member per month trend factor are the most significant factors used in estimating our reserves for claims 
since a large portion of the reserves for claims is attributed to the most recent months  the estimated reserves for claims are highly sensitive to these factors 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by these factors completion factor a percentage point increase decrease in factor health plan services increase decrease in reserves for claims million million million million medical cost trend b percentage point increase decrease in factor health plan services increase decrease in reserves for claims million million million million a impact due to change in completion factor for the most recent three months 
completion factors indicate how complete claims paid to date are in relation to the estimate of total claims for a given period 
therefore  an increase in completion factor percent results in a decrease in the remaining estimated reserves for claims 
b impact due to change in annualized medical cost trend used to estimate the per member per month cost for the most recent three months 
other relevant factors include exceptional situations that might require judgmental adjustments in setting the reserves for claims  such as system conversions  processing interruptions or changes  environmental changes or other factors 
all of these factors are used in estimating reserves for claims and are important to our reserve 
table of contents methodology in trending the claims per member per month for purposes of estimating the reserves for the most recent months 
in developing our best estimate of reserves for claims  we consistently apply the principles and methodology described above from year to year  while also giving due consideration to the potential variability of these factors 
because reserves for claims include various actuarially developed estimates  our actual health care services expense may be more or less than our previously developed estimates 
claims processing expenses are also accrued based on an estimate of expenses necessary to process such claims 
such reserves are continually monitored and reviewed  with any adjustments reflected in current operations 
hn of california  our california hmo  generally contracts with various medical groups to provide professional care to certain of its members on a capitated  or fixed per member per month fee basis 
capitation contracts generally include a provision for stop loss and non capitated services for which we are liable 
professional capitated contracts also generally contain provisions for shared risk 
we have risk sharing arrangements with certain of our providers related to approximately  members  primarily in the california commercial market 
shared risk arrangements provide for us to share with our providers the variance between actual costs and predetermined goals 
our hmos in other states also contract with hospitals  physicians and other providers of health care  pursuant to discounted fee for service arrangements  hospital per diems  and case rates under which providers bill the hmos for each individual service provided to enrollees 
additionally  we contract with certain hospitals to provide hospital care to enrolled members on a capitation basis 
we assess the profitability of contracts for providing health care services when operating results or forecasts indicate probable future losses 
significant factors that can lead to a change in our profitability estimates include premium yield and health care cost trend assumptions  risk share terms and non performance of a provider under a capitated agreement resulting in membership reverting to fee for service arrangements with other providers 
contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with the method of determining premium rates 
losses are determined by comparing anticipated premiums to estimates for the total of health care related costs less reinsurance recoveries  if any  and the cost of maintaining the contracts 
losses  if any  are recognized in the period the losses are determined and are classified as health plan services 
we held no premium deficiency reserves as of december  government contracts the tricare north region contract is made up of two major revenue components  health care and administrative services 
health care services revenue includes health care costs  including paid claims and estimated ibnr expenses  for care provided for which we are at risk and underwriting fees earned for providing the health care and assuming underwriting risk in the delivery of care 
administrative services revenue encompasses all other services provided to both the government customer and to beneficiaries  including services such as medical management  claims processing  enrollment  customer services and other services unique to the managed care support contracts with the government 
health care costs and associated revenues are recognized as the costs are incurred and the associated revenue is earned 
revenue related to administrative services is recognized as the services are provided and earned 
revenues associated with the transition to the tricare contract for the north region are recognized over the entire term of the contract 
there are different variables that impact the estimate of the ibnr reserves for our tricare business than those that impact our managed care businesses 
these variables consist of changes in the level of our nation s military activity  including the call up of reservists in support of heightened military activity  continual changes in the number of eligible beneficiaries  changes in the health care facilities in which the eligible beneficiaries seek treatment  and revisions to the provisions of the contract in the form of change orders 
each of these factors is subject to significant judgment  and we have incorporated our best estimate of these factors in estimating the reserve for ibnr claims 

table of contents as part of our tricare contract for the north region  we have a risk sharing arrangement with the federal government whereby variances in actual claim experience from the targeted medical claim amount negotiated in our annual bid are shared 
due to this risk sharing arrangement provided for in the tricare contract for the north region  the changes in the estimate of the ibnr reserves are not expected to have a material effect on the favorable or adverse development of our liability under the tricare contract 
other government contracts revenues are recognized in the month in which the eligible beneficiaries are entitled to health care services or in the month in which the administrative services are performed or the period that coverage for services is provided 
under our tricare contract for the north region we recognize amounts receivable and payable under the government contracts related to estimated health care ibnr expenses which are reported separately on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  these amounts are the same since all of the estimated health care ibnr expenses incurred are offset by an equal amount of revenues earned 
some of the amounts receivable under government contracts are comprised primarily of contractually defined billings  deferred underwriting fees under the terms of the contract and change orders for services not originally specified in the contracts 
change orders arise because the government often directs us to implement changes to our contracts before the scope and or value is defined or negotiated 
we start to incur costs immediately  before we have proposed a price to the government 
in these situations  we make no attempt to estimate and record revenue 
our policy is to defer the costs as incurred until we have submitted a cost proposal to the government  at which time we will record the costs and the appropriate value for revenue  using our best estimate of what will ultimately be negotiated 
in the normal course of contracting with the federal government  we may make claims for contract and price adjustments arising from cost overruns against the government 
we recognize such claims when the amounts become determinable  supportable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
reserves for contingent liabilities in the course of our operations  we are involved on a routine basis in various disputes with members  health care providers  and other entities  as well as audits by government agencies that relate to our services and or business practices that expose us to potential losses 
we recognize an estimated loss  which may represent damages  settlement costs  future legal expenses or a combination of the foregoing  as appropriate  from such loss contingencies when it is both probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our loss estimates are based in part on an analysis of potential results  the stage of the proceedings  consultation with outside counsel and any other relevant information available 
goodwill goodwill and other intangible assets arise primarily as a result of various business acquisitions and consist of identifiable intangible assets acquired and the excess of the cost of the acquisitions over the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of the value of employer group contracts  provider networks and customer relationships  which are all subject to amortization 
we perform our annual impairment test on our recorded goodwill as of june or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that we might not recover the carrying value of these assets for each of our reporting units 
health plans services is our only reporting unit with goodwill as of december  and we test goodwill for impairment annually based on the estimated fair value of our health plan services reporting unit 
we test for impairment on a more frequent basis in cases where events and changes in circumstances would indicate that we might not recover the carrying value of goodwill 
our measurement of fair 
table of contents value is primarily based on the income approach to fair value determination 
the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow methodology 
the discounted cash flow methodology is based upon converting expected cash flows to present value 
annual cash flows are estimated for each year of a defined multi year period until the growth pattern becomes stable 
the interim cash flows expected after the growth pattern becomes stable are calculated using an appropriate capitalization technique and then discounted 
there are numerous assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the estimated fair value of our reporting units  including certain assumptions and estimates related to future earnings and membership levels based on current and future plans and initiatives  long term strategies and our annual planning and forecasting process as well as the weighted average cost of capital used in the discounting process 
if these planned initiatives do not accomplish their targeted objectives  the assumptions and estimates underlying the goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected and have a material effect upon our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
during the year ended december   we recorded higher than expected health care costs and lowered our earnings guidance 
the reduction in guidance was primarily driven by lower than expected commercial enrollment  higher than expected commercial health care cost trends  and the volatile economic environment 
as a result of this revised outlook combined with a decline in our market capitalization  we updated our annual impairment test on our goodwill asset as of september  and as of december   which indicated that there was no impairment 
recoverability of long lived assets and investments we periodically assess the recoverability of our long lived assets including property and equipment and other long term assets and investments where events and changes in circumstances would indicate that we might not recover the carrying value as follows long lived assets held and used we test long lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
if we identify an indicator of impairment  we assess recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and is measured as the excess of carrying value over fair value 
we recognized such an impairment of million in representing impairments of investment securities and long lived assets  including property and equipment 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated by applying enacted tax rates and laws to taxable years in which such differences are expected to reverse 
we establish a valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits from our deferred tax assets only when an analysis of both positive and negative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the benefits will be realized 
we file tax returns in many tax jurisdictions 
often  application of tax rules within the various jurisdictions is subject to differing interpretation 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that it is probable certain positions will be challenged by taxing authorities  and we may not prevail on 
table of contents the positions as filed 
accordingly  we maintain a liability for the estimated amount of contingent tax challenges by taxing authorities upon examination  in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which we adopted as of january  prior to  we maintained a liability pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertain taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
the interpretation requires us to analyze the amount at which each tax position meets a more likely than not standard for sustainability upon examination by taxing authorities 
only tax benefit amounts meeting or exceeding this standard will be reflected in tax provision expense and deferred tax asset balances 
the interpretation also requires that any differences between the amounts of tax benefits reported on tax returns and tax benefits reported in the financial statements be recorded in a liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is reported separately from deferred tax assets and liabilities and classified as current or noncurrent based upon the expected period of payment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to fin policies and the impact of adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate and market risk primarily due to our investing and borrowing activities 
market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and in equity prices 
interest rate risk is a consequence of maintaining variable interest rate earning investments and fixed rate liabilities or fixed income investments and variable rate liabilities 
we are exposed to interest rate risks arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates  prepayment speeds and or the shape and slope of the yield curve 
in addition  we are exposed to the risk of loss related to changes in credit spreads 
credit spread risk arises from the potential changes in an issuer s credit rating or credit perception that will affect the value of financial instruments 
we attempt to manage the interest rate risks related to our investment portfolios by actively managing the asset duration of our investment portfolios 
the overall goal for the investment portfolios is to provide a source of liquidity and support the ongoing operations of our business units 
our philosophy is to actively manage assets to maximize total return over a multiple year time horizon  subject to appropriate levels of risk 
each business unit has additional requirements with respect to liquidity  current income and contribution to surplus 
we manage these risks by setting risk tolerances  targeting asset class allocations  diversifying among assets and asset characteristics  and using performance measurement and reporting 
we use a value at risk var model  which follows a variance co variance methodology  to assess the market risk for our investment portfolio 
var is a method of assessing investment risk that uses standard statistical techniques to measure the worst expected loss in the portfolio over an assumed portfolio disposition period under normal market conditions 
the determination is made at a given statistical confidence level 
we assumed a portfolio disposition period of days with a confidence level of for the computation of var for the computation further assumes that the distribution of returns is normal 
based on such methodology and assumptions  the computed var was approximately million as of december  our calculated var exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that could be recognized on our investment portfolios assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and are not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in our investment portfolios during the year 
except for those securities held by trustees or regulatory agencies see note to our consolidated financial statements  all of our investment securities are designated as available for sale assets 
as such  they are reflected at their estimated fair value  with the difference between amortized cost and estimated fair value 
table of contents reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity see note to the consolidated financial statements 
virtually  all of our investment securities are fixed income securities 
approximately of our available for sale investment securities are mortgage backed securities mbs and asset backed securities abs 
approximately of the mbs are backed by federal agencies 
therefore  we believe that our exposure to credit related market value risk for our mbs is limited 
generally  in a rising interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of fixed income securities would be expected to decrease  conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of fixed income securities would be expected to increase 
however  these securities may be negatively impacted by illiquidity in the market 
the recent disruptions in the credit markets have negatively impacted the liquidity of investments 
however  such disruptions did not have a material impact to the liquidity of our investments 
a worsening of credit market disruptions or sustained market downturns could have negative effects on the liquidity and value of our investment assets 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which totaled million as of december   are subject to variable interest rates 
for additional information regarding our revolving credit facility  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our floating rate borrowings  if any  are presumed to have equal book and fair values because the interest rates paid on these borrowings  if any  are based on prevailing market rates 
the fair value of our fixed rate borrowings  including our senior notes and financing facility as of december   was approximately million  which was based on quoted market prices 
where quoted market prices were not readily available  fair values were estimated using valuation methodologies based on available and observable market information 
such valuation methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing  comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business  and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows
