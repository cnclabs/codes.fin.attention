manufacturing  operations  and products security products 
our security products segment  with a manufacturing facility in south carolina and a facility in illinois shared with marine components  manufactures locking mechanisms and other security products for sale to the postal  transportation  office furniture  banking  vending  and other industries 
we believe we are a north american market leader in the manufacture and sale of cabinet locks and other locking mechanisms 
our security products are used in a variety of applications including ignition systems  mailboxes  vending and gaming machines  parking meters  electrical circuit panels  storage compartments  office furniture and medical cabinet security 
these products include disc tumbler locks which provide moderate security and generally represent the lowest cost lock to produce  pin tumbler locking mechanisms which are more costly to produce and are used in applications requiring higher levels of security  including our keset high security system  which allows the user to change the keying on a single lock times without removing the lock from its enclosure  and our innovative elock electronic locks which provide stand alone security and audit trail capability for drug storage and other valuables through the use of a proximity card  magnetic stripe  or keypad credentials 
a substantial portion of our security products sales consist of products with specialized adaptations to an individual manufacturer s specifications  some of which are listed above 
we also have a standardized product line suitable for many customers which is offered through a north american distribution network to lock distributors and smaller original equipment manufacturers oems via our stock locks distribution program 
furniture components 
our furniture components segment  with facilities in canada  michigan and taiwan  manufactures a complete line of precision ball bearing slides and ergonomic computer support systems for use in applications such as computer related equipment  appliances  tool storage cabinets  imaging equipment  file cabinets  desk drawers  automated teller machines and other applications 
these products include our patented integrated slide lock which allows a file cabinet manufacturer to reduce the possibility of multiple drawers being opened at the same time  our patented adjustable ball lock which reduces the risk of heavily filled drawers  such as auto mechanic tool boxes  from opening while in movement  our self closing slide  which is designed to assist in closing a drawer and is used in applications such as bottom mount freezers  articulating computer keyboard support arms designed to attach to desks in the workplace and home office environments to alleviate possible user strains and stress and maximize usable workspace  along with our patented leverlock keyboard arm  which is designed to make ergonomic adjustments to the keyboard arm easier  cpu storage devices which minimize adverse effects of dust and moisture  and complementary accessories  such as ergonomic wrist rest aids  mouse pad supports and flat screen computer monitor support arms 
marine components 
our marine components segment  with a facility in wisconsin and a facility in illinois shared with security products  manufactures and distributes marine instruments  hardware and accessories for performance boats 
our specialty marine component products are high performance components designed to operate within precise tolerances in the highly corrosive marine environment 
these products include original equipment and aftermarket stainless steel exhaust headers  exhaust pipes  mufflers and other exhaust components  high performance gauges such as gps speedometers and tachometers  controls  throttles  steering wheels and other billet accessories  and dash panels  led lighting  rigging and other accessories 
our business segments operated six manufacturing facilities at december  including one facility in grayslake  illinois that houses operations relating to security products and marine components

security products furniture components marine components mauldin  sc grayslake  il kitchener  ontario byron center  mi taipei  taiwan neenah  wi grayslake  il raw materials our primary raw materials are zinc  copper and brass used in the security products segment for the manufacture of locking mechanisms  coiled steel used in the furniture components segment for the manufacture of precision ball bearing slides and ergonomic computer support systems  stainless steel used in the marine components segment for the manufacture of exhaust headers and pipes and other components  and plastic resins used primarily in the furniture components segment for injection molded plastics employed in the manufacturing of ergonomic computer support systems 
these raw materials are purchased from several suppliers and are readily available from numerous sources 
we occasionally enter into raw material arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
while these arrangements do not necessarily commit us to a minimum volume of purchases  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified purchase volumes 
we utilize purchase arrangements to stabilize our raw material prices provided we meet the specified minimum monthly purchase quantities 
raw materials purchased outside of these arrangements are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products  it is often difficult to recover all increases in raw material costs through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges 
consequently  overall operating margins can be affected by raw material cost pressures 
all of our primary raw materials are impacted by related commodity markets where prices are cyclical  reflecting overall economic trends and specific developments in consuming industries 
patents and trademarks we hold a number of patents relating to our component products  certain of which are believed to be important to us and our continuing business activity 
patents generally have a term of years  and our patents have remaining terms ranging from less than one year to years at december  our major trademarks and brand names include furniture components security products marine components compx precision slides compx security products custom marine compx waterloo national cabinet lock livorsi marine compx ergonomx fort lock cmi industrial mufflers compx durislide timberline custom marine stainless dynaslide chicago lock exhaust waterloo furniture stock locks the choice in components limited keset performance boating tubar mega rim ace ii race rim compx elock compx marine lockview software sales  marketing and distribution 
we sell components directly to large oem customers through our factory based sales and marketing professionals and with engineers working in concert with field salespeople and independent manufacturers representatives 
we select manufacturers representatives based on special skills in certain markets or relationships with current or potential customers 
a significant portion of our sales are also made through distributors 
we have a significant market share of cabinet lock sales as a result of the locksmith distribution channel 
we support our distributor sales with a line of standardized products used by the largest segments of the marketplace 
these products are packaged and merchandised for easy availability and handling by distributors and end users 
due to our success with the stock locks inventory program within the security products segment  similar programs have been implemented for distributor sales of ergonomic computer support systems within the furniture components segment 
in  our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our total sales  however  no one customer accounted for sales of or more in of the  was related to security products and was related to furniture components 
overall  our customer base is diverse and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
competition the markets in which we participate are highly competitive 
we compete primarily on the basis of product design  including ergonomic and aesthetic factors  product quality and durability  price  on time delivery  service and technical support 
we focus our efforts on the middle and high end segments of the market  where product design  quality  durability and service are valued by the customer 
our marine components segment competes with small domestic manufacturers and is minimally affected by foreign competitors 
our security products and furniture components segments compete against a number of domestic and foreign manufacturers 
suppliers  particularly asian based furniture component suppliers  have put intense price pressure on our products 
in some cases  we have lost sales to these lower cost manufacturers 
we have responded by shifting the manufacture of some products to our lower cost facilities  working to reduce costs and gain operational efficiencies through workforce reductions and lean process improvements in all of our facilities  and by working with our customers to be their value added supplier of choice by offering customer support services which asian based suppliers are generally unable to provide 
international operations we have substantial operations and assets located outside the united states  principally furniture component operations in canada and taiwan 
the majority of our non us sales are to customers located in canada 
these operations are subject to  among other things  currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our results of operations have in the past been both favorably and unfavorably affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
political and economic uncertainties in certain of the countries in which we operate may expose us to risk of loss 
we do not believe that there is currently any likelihood of material loss through political or economic instability  seizure  nationalization or similar event 
we cannot predict  however  whether events of this type in the future could have a material effect on our operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the consolidated financial statements 
regulatory and environmental matters our operations are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use  storage  handling  generation  transportation  treatment  emission  discharge  disposal  remediation of and exposure to hazardous and non hazardous substances  materials and wastes environmental laws 
our operations also are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all such laws and regulations 
to date  the costs of maintaining compliance with such laws and regulations have not significantly impacted our results 
we currently do not anticipate any significant costs or expenses relating to such matters  however  it is possible future laws and regulations may require us to incur significant additional expenditures 
employees as of december   we employed the following number of people united states canada taiwan total approximately of our canadian employees are represented by a labor union covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
a new collective bargaining agreement  providing for wage increases from to  was ratified in january and expires january we believe our labor relations are good at all of our facilities

item a 
risk factors listed below are certain risk factors associated with us and our businesses 
in addition to the potential effect of these risk factors discussed below  any risk factor which could result in reduced earnings or operating losses  or reduced liquidity  could in turn adversely affect our ability to service our liabilities or pay dividends on our common stock or adversely affect the quoted market prices for our securities 
many of the markets in which we operate are mature and highly competitive resulting in pricing pressure and the need to continuously reduce costs 
many of the markets we serve are highly competitive  with a number of competitors offering similar products 
we focus our efforts on the middle and high end segment of the market where we feel that we can compete due to the importance of product design  quality and durability to the customer 
however  our ability to effectively compete is impacted by a number of factors 
the occurrence of any of these factors could result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
competitors may be able to drive down prices for our products because their costs are lower than our costs  especially those sourced from asia 
competitors financial  technological and other resources may be greater than our resources  which may enable them to more effectively withstand changes in market conditions 
competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
consolidation of our competitors or customers in any of the markets in which we compete may result in reduced demand for our products 
new competitors could emerge by modifying their existing production facilities to manufacture products that compete with our products 
our ability to sustain a cost structure that enables us to be cost competitive 
our ability to adjust costs relative to our pricing 
customers may no longer value our product design  quality or durability over lower cost products of our competitors 
sales for certain precision slides and ergonomic products are concentrated in the office furniture industry  which has periodically experienced significant reductions in demand that could result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
sales of our products to the office furniture manufacturing industry accounted for approximately  and for  and  respectively  of our net sales 
the future growth  if any  of the office furniture industry will be affected by a variety of macroeconomic factors  such as service industry employment levels  corporate cash flows and non residential commercial construction  as well as industry factors such as corporate reengineering and restructuring  technology demands  ergonomic  health and safety concerns and corporate relocations 
there can be no assurance that current or future economic or industry trends will not materially and adversely affect our business 
our failure to enter into new markets with our current businesses would result in the continued significant impact of fluctuations in demand within the office furniture manufacturing industry on our operating results 
in an effort to reduce our dependence on the office furniture market for certain products and to increase our participation in other markets  we have been devoting resources to identify new customers and develop new applications for those products in markets outside of the office furniture industry  such as home appliances  tool boxes and server racks 
developing these new applications for our products involves substantial risk and uncertainties due to our limited experience with customers and applications in these markets as well as facing competitors who are already established in these markets 
we may not be successful in developing new customers or applications for our products outside of the office furniture industry 
significant time may be required to develop new applications and uncertainty exists as to the extent to which we will face competition in this regard 
our development of innovative features for current products is critical to sustaining and growing our sales 
historically  our ability to provide value added custom engineered products that address requirements of technology and space utilization has been a key element of our success 
we spend a significant amount of time and effort to refine  improve and adapt our existing products for new customers and applications 
since expenditures for these types of activities are not considered research and development expense under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the amount of our research and development expenditures  which is not significant  is not indicative of the overall effort involved in the development of new product features 
the introduction of new product features requires the coordination of the design  manufacturing and marketing of the new product features with current and potential customers 
the ability to coordinate these activities with current and potential customers may be affected by factors beyond our control 
while we will continue to emphasize the introduction of innovative new product features that target customer specific opportunities  there can be no assurance that any new product features we introduce will achieve the same degree of success that we have achieved with our existing products 
introduction of new product features typically requires us to increase production volume on a timely basis while maintaining product quality 
manufacturers often encounter difficulties in increasing production volumes  including delays  quality control problems and shortages of qualified personnel or raw materials 
as we attempt to introduce new product features in the future  there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase production volume without encountering these or other problems  which might negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations 
recent and future acquisitions could subject us to a number of operational risks 
a key component of our strategy is to grow and diversify our business through acquisitions 
our ability to successfully execute this component of our strategy entails a number of risks  including the identification of suitable growth opportunities  an inaccurate assessment of acquired liabilities that were undisclosed or not properly disclosed  the entry into markets in which we may have limited or no experience  the diversion of management s attention from our core businesses  the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses  difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies  synergies and cost savings  and an increase in our indebtedness and a limitation in our ability to access additional capital when needed 
higher costs of our raw materials may decrease our liquidity 
certain of the raw materials used in our products are commodities that are subject to significant fluctuations in price in response to world wide supply and demand 
coiled steel is the major raw material used in the manufacture of precision ball bearing slides and ergonomic computer support systems 
plastic resins for injection molded plastics are also an integral material for ergonomic computer support systems 
zinc is a principal raw material used in the manufacture of security products 
stainless steel tubing is the major raw material used in the manufacture of marine exhaust systems 
these raw materials are purchased from several suppliers and are generally readily available from numerous sources 
we occasionally enter into raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
materials purchased outside of these arrangements are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
should our vendors not be able to meet their contractual obligations or should we be otherwise unable to obtain necessary raw materials  we may incur higher costs for raw materials or may be required to reduce production levels  either of which may decrease our liquidity as we may be unable to offset the higher costs with increased selling prices for our products 
negative worldwide economic conditions could continue to result in a decrease in our sales and an increase in our operating costs  which could continue to adversely affect our business and operating results 
if the current worldwide economic downturn continues  many of our direct and indirect customers may continue to delay or reduce their purchases of the components we manufacture or products that utilize our components 
in addition  many of our customers rely on credit financing for their working capital needs 
if the negative conditions in the global credit markets continue to prevent our customers access to credit  product orders may continue to decrease which could result in lower sales 
likewise  if our suppliers continue to face challenges in obtaining credit  in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses  they may become unable to continue to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products 
these actions could continue to result in reductions in our sales  increased price competition and increased operating costs  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
negative global economic conditions increase the risk that we could suffer unrecoverable losses on our customers accounts receivable which would adversely affect our financial results 
we extend credit and payment terms to some of our customers 
although we have an ongoing process of evaluating our customers financial condition  we could suffer significant losses if a customer fails and is unable to pay us 
a significant loss of an accounts receivable would have a negative impact on our financial results

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a leading manufacturer of security products  precision ball bearing slides  and ergonomic computer support systems used in the office furniture  transportation  postal  tool storage  home appliance and a variety of other industries 
we are also a leading manufacturer of stainless steel exhaust systems  gauges and throttle controls for the performance boat industry 
operating income overview we reported operating income of million in compared to operating income of million in and million in our results include a million goodwill impairment charge related to our marine components unit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the goodwill impairment charge has no impact on our liquidity  cash flows from operating activities  or debt covenant compliance  and does not have any impact on future operations 
in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results of operations as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we have disclosed below our operating income  excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge  which is a non gaap measure that is used by our management to assess the performance of our operations 
we believe the disclosure of operating income  exclusive of the goodwill impairment charge  provides useful information to investors because it allows investors to analyze the performance of our operations in the same way that our management assesses performance 
operating income for the year ended december  including the effect of the goodwill impairment charge goodwill impairment excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment charge gaap charge non gaap dollars in thousands operating income excluding the goodwill impairment charge  we reported operating income of million in compared to million in  although operating income was impacted by million in facility consolidation costs 
the change in operating income compared to  excluding the goodwill impairment charge  was primarily the net result of lower order rates from many of our customers due to unfavorable economic conditions in north america and increased raw material costs  offset by the favorable effects of facility consolidation costs incurred in  the continuation of cost reductions throughout and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our operating income decreased from to primarily due to the unfavorable effects of costs incurred in related to the consolidation of three of our northern illinois facilities into one facility  the unfavorable effect of relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates  lower sales to the office furniture industry due to competition from lower priced asian manufacturers and lower order rates from many of our customers due to unfavorable economic conditions in north america 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted sales by  and positively impacted operating income by million in  as compared to the positive impact on sales relates to sales denominated in non us dollar currencies translated into higher us dollar sales due to a strengthening of the local currency in relation to the us dollar 
the positive impact on operating income is due to foreign currency transaction gains in as compared to losses in fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted sales in as compared to by  and negatively impacted operating income by million 
the impact on net sales is primarily due to the strengthening canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar 
the net impact on operating income primarily results from our canadian operations  due to the relative increase in costs as a result of the stronger canadian dollar 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have based the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations upon our consolidated financial statements 
we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory reserves  the recoverability of long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets and the realization of deferred income tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our actual future results might differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are applicable to all of our operating segments inventory reserves we provide reserves for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we also consider the age and the quantity of inventory on hand in estimating the reserve 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected  we may be required to recognize additional inventory reserves 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we review goodwill for impairment at least annually 
we are also required to review goodwill for impairment at other times during each year when impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
the estimated fair values of our three reporting units are determined based on discounted cash flow projections level inputs 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
significant judgment is required in estimating cash flows 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans 
during the third quarter of  we reviewed goodwill for impairment at each of our reporting units 
we concluded the fair value of our marine reporting unit did not exceed the carrying value of its net assets as of september  as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million for our marine components reporting unit  which represented all of the goodwill we had previously recognized for this reporting unit 
the factors that led us to conclude goodwill associated with the marine components reporting unit was fully impaired include the continued decline in consumer spending in the marine market as well as the overall negative economic outlook  both of which resulted in near term and longer term reduced revenue  profit and cash flow forecasts for the marine components unit 
while we continue to believe in the long term potential of the marine components unit  due to the extraordinary economic downturn in the marine industry we are not currently able to foresee when the industry and our business will recover 
in response to the present economic conditions  we have taken steps to reduce operating costs without inhibiting our ability to take advantage of opportunities to expand our market share 
when we performed this analysis in the third quarter of  we also reviewed the goodwill associated with our security products and furniture components reporting units as well as the other intangible assets associated with our marine components unit including customer lists  trademarks and patents  and concluded there was no impairment of either the goodwill for those reporting units or the other intangible assets of our marine components unit 
the estimated fair values were also determined based on discounted cash flow projections 
assumptions used in these impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans 
however  different assumptions and estimates could result in materially different findings which could result in the recognition of a material asset impairment 
due to the continued weakening of the economy  we re evaluated the goodwill associated with our furniture components reporting unit again in the fourth quarter of and concluded no additional impairments were present 
if our future results were to be significantly below our current expectations  it is reasonably likely that we would conclude additional impairments of the goodwill and intangible assets associated with our furniture components reporting unit would be present 
as of december  our furniture components reporting unit had approximately million of goodwill 
holding all other assumptions constant at the re evaluation date  a to basis point increase in the discount rate would reduce the enterprise value for our furniture components reporting unit  indicating potential impairment 
if we record additional impairment charges in the future  it could cause us to fail to comply with one or more of the financial covenants contained in our credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the event we were to fail to comply with one or more covenants  we would attempt to negotiate waivers of any noncompliance  however  there can be no assurance that we would be able to negotiate any waivers 
in addition  the costs or conditions associated with any waivers could be significant 
at december  we had no balances outstanding under the facility and we do not anticipate needing to utilize the facility for operations in long lived assets we assess our property and equipment costs for impairment only when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
our determination is based upon  among other things  our estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset level inputs and our estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
significant judgment is required in estimating cash flows 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans 
no impairment was identified in income taxes we recognize deferred taxes for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting in accordance with the recognition criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we record a reserve for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin no 
 accounting for uncertain tax positions for tax positions where we believe it is more likely than not our position will not prevail with the applicable tax authorities 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period the change in estimate was made 
in addition  we make an evaluation at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested as that term is defined in gaap 
while we may have concluded in the past that some of the undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances can change in the future  and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances  such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries  could result in a conclusion that some or all of the undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
in such an event  we would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental us income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of the previously considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were distributed to us in the us accruals we record accruals for environmental  legal and other contingencies and commitments when estimated future expenditures associated with the contingencies become probable  and we can reasonably estimate the amounts of the future expenditures 
however  new information may become available to us  or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount we are required to accrue for such matters and  therefore  a corresponding decrease or increase of our reported net income in the period of such change

net sales decreased in as compared to principally due to lower order rates from many of our customers resulting from unfavorable economic conditions in north america  offset in part by the effect of sales price increases for certain products to mitigate the effect of higher raw material costs 
net sales decreased in as compared to principally due to lower sales of certain products to the office furniture market where asian competitors have established selling prices at a level below which we consider would return a minimally sufficient margin to us as well as lower order rates from many of our customers due to unfavorable economic conditions  offset in part by the effect of sales price increases for certain products to mitigate the effect of higher raw material costs 
costs of goods sold and gross margin 
cost of goods sold decreased from to primarily due to decreased sales volumes 
as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased in from the prior year 
the decrease in gross margin is primarily due to higher raw material costs  not all of which could be recovered through sales price increases or surcharges  combined with reduced coverage of fixed manufacturing costs from lower sales volume partially offset by lower depreciation expense in due to a reduction in capital expenditure requirements for shorter lived assets over the last several years in response to lower sales 
cost of goods sold decreased from to  and gross margin percentage increased from the prior year 
during  we experienced the favorable effects of an improved product mix due to the sales decline primarily occurring in our lower margin furniture components segment and improved operating efficiency within our recently acquired marine operations partially offset by the unfavorable effect of relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates  lower sales to the office furniture industry due to competition from lower priced asian manufacturers and lower order rates from many of our customers due to unfavorable economic conditions 
operating costs and expenses 
operating costs and expenses consists primarily of salaries  commissions and advertising expenses directly related to product sales  as well as  gains and losses on plant  property and equipment and currency gains and losses 
as a percentage of net sales  operating costs and expenses decreased from to primarily as a result of million of costs recorded in related to the consolidation of three of our northern illinois facilities into one facility see note to the consolidated financial statements and a million favorable change in currency gains and losses 
as a percentage of net sales  operating costs and expenses increased from to primarily as a result of lower sales volumes in  the increase in foreign exchange transaction losses due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar a loss increase over of million as well as million of costs related to the consolidation of three of our northern illinois facilities into one facility in goodwill impairment 
in  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million for our marine components reporting unit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating income 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge discussed above  the comparison of operating income for to was primarily impacted by a negative impact of approximately million relating to lower order rates from many of our customers resulting from unfavorable economic conditions in north america  and increased raw material costs that we were not able to fully recover through sales price increases by approximately million due to the competitive nature of the markets we serve 
the above decreases were primarily offset by the one time million of facility consolidation costs incurred in million in lower depreciation expense in due to a reduction in capital expenditures for shorter lived assets over the last several years in response to lower sales  and the million favorable effect on operating income of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
operating income for decreased million  or compared to and operating margins decreased to in compared to for we experienced the favorable effects of an improved product mix due to a higher portion of the sales decline in occurring among lower margin products  an increased percentage of sales from our higher margin marine business  and improved operating efficiency within our recently acquired marine operations 
however  these improvements were more than offset by the unfavorable effects of the million one time facility consolidation costs noted above  a million unfavorable effect of relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates including the million related to foreign exchange transaction losses noted above  lower sales to the office furniture industry due to competition from lower priced asian manufacturers  and lower order rates from many of our customers due to unfavorable economic conditions 
currency 
our furniture components segment has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states in canada and taiwan 
the majority of sales generated from our non us operations are denominated in the us dollar with the remainder denominated in other currencies  principally the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for our non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar values of our non us sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
overall  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had the following effects on our furniture component segment s net sales and operating income increase decrease year ended december  vs vs impact on in thousands net sales operating income the positive impact on sales relates to sales denominated in non us dollar currencies translating into higher us dollar sales due to a strengthening of the local currency in relation to the us dollar 
the negative impact on operating income for the versus comparison results from the us dollar denominated sales of non us operations converted into lower local currency amounts due to the weakening of the us dollar 
this negatively impacts margin as it results in less local currency generated from sales to cover the costs of non us operations which are denominated in the local currency 
the positive impact on operating income for the versus comparison is due to currency exchange gains in as compared to losses in general our profitability primarily depends on our ability to utilize our production capacity effectively  which is affected by  among other things  the demand for our products and our ability to control our manufacturing costs  primarily comprised of labor costs and raw materials such as zinc  copper  coiled steel  stainless steel and plastic resins 
raw material costs represent approximately of our total cost of sales 
during  and most of  worldwide raw material costs increased significantly 
we occasionally enter into raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
while these arrangements do not necessarily commit us to a minimum volume of purchases  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified volume purchase levels 
this allows us to stabilize raw material purchase prices to a certain extent  provided the specified minimum monthly purchase quantities are met 
we enter into such arrangements for zinc  coiled steel and plastic resins 
while raw material purchase prices have recently declined  it is uncertain whether the current prices will stabilize during materials purchased on the spot market are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products  it is often difficult to recover increases in raw material costs through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges 
consequently  overall operating margins may be affected by raw material cost pressures 
other non operating income  net as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements  other non operating income  net primarily includes interest income 
interest income decreased in compared to by approximately  due to lower interest rates on lower invested cash balances 
other non operating income was comparable from to interest expense interest expense increased approximately million in compared to and increased  in compared to  as a result of financing the october repurchase and or cancellation of a net million shares of our class a common stock from an affiliate with a promissory note 
we expect interest expense to be lower than due to lower average debt outstanding and lower interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes as a member of the contran tax group  we compute our provision for income taxes on a separate company basis  using the tax elections made by contran 
one such election is whether to claim a deduction or a tax credit against us taxable income with respect to foreign income taxes paid 
consistent with elections of the contran tax group  in  and we did not claim a credit with respect to foreign income taxes paid but instead we claimed a tax deduction for related withholding taxes 
this resulted in an increase in our effective income tax rate 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge  our effective income tax rate increased from in to in primarily due to a higher percentage of our earnings being sourced from canada and as noted above  the taxes on these earnings are not claimed as a credit on our us tax return 
our effective income tax rate was comparable at and in and  respectively 
we currently expect our effective income tax rate for will approximate our effective income tax rate for  excluding the goodwill impairment charge 
segment results the key performance indicator for our segments is the level of their operating income see discussion below

security products net sales decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease in sales is primarily due to lower order rates from many of our customers resulting from unfavorable economic conditions in north america  offset in part by the effect of sales price increases for certain products to mitigate the effect of higher raw material costs 
as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased in compared to primarily due to increased raw material costs that were not fully recovered through price increases 
operating income percentage increased slightly in primarily as a result of million of costs incurred in related to the consolidation of two of our northern illinois security products facilities shared with a marine components operation 
security products net sales decreased to million in compared to million in gross margin percentage was comparable year over year 
operating income margin percentage decreased in compared to  which resulted in a decrease in operating income 
the operating income margin percentage decrease was primarily due to the facility consolidation discussed above and the lower sales volumes resulting from lower order rates from many of our customers due to unfavorable economic conditions offset by lower raw material costs in furniture components 
furniture components net sales decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower order rates from many of our customers resulting from unfavorable economic conditions in north america  offset in part by the effect of sales price increases for certain products to mitigate the effect of higher raw material costs 
gross margin percentage was comparable year over year 
operating income percentage increased in compared to primarily due to a million favorable change in the effect of currency exchange rates 
furniture components net sales decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower sales volumes to the office furniture industry where  for certain products asian competitors have established selling prices at a level below which we consider would return a minimally sufficient margin to us and the effect of lower order rates from many of our customers due to unfavorable economic conditions 
gross margin percentage increased slightly in compared to due to million in lower depreciation expense resulting from a reduction in capital expenditures over the last several years in response to lower sales and improvements in operational efficiencies through lean manufacturing and other process improvements 
marine components 
marine components net sales decreased in as compared to primarily due to a dramatic overall downturn in the marine industry 
gross margin percentage decreased from in to in operating income for the marine components segment includes a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million as a result of our third quarter goodwill evaluation analysis 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge  operating income decreased from approximately  of income in to an operating loss of approximately  in the decreases in gross margin and operating income are the result of reduced coverage of fixed costs from lower sales volume 
marine components net sales increased in from due to the impact of a marine acquisition in april operating income was comparable from to as improvements in gross margin relating to improved production efficiency were offset by increased selling and administrative costs relating to creating more robust support functions for those recently acquired businesses 
outlook demand for our products continues to slow  especially during the fourth quarter of  as customers react to the condition of the overall economy 
while all segments of our business are being affected  we are experiencing a greater softness in demand in the industries we serve which are more directly connected to lower consumer spending  as further explained below 
our security products segment is the least affected by the softness in consumer demand  because we sell products to a diverse number of business customers across a wide range of markets  most of which are not directly impacted by changes in consumer demand 
while demand within this segment is not as significantly affected by softness in the overall economy  we expect sales to be lower over the next twelve months 
our furniture components segment sales are primarily concentrated in the office furniture  toolbox  home appliance and a number of other industries 
several of these industries  primarily toolbox and home appliance  are more directly affected by consumer demand than those served by our security products segment 
we expect many of the markets served by furniture components to continue to experience low demand over the next twelve months 
our marine segment has been the most affected by the slowing economy as the decrease in consumer confidence  the decline in home values  a tighter credit market and volatile fuel costs have resulted in a significant reduction in consumer spending in the marine market 
we do not expect the marine market to recover until consumer confidence returns and home values stabilize 
while changes in market demand are not within our control  we are focused on the areas we can impact 
we expect our lean manufacturing and cost improvement initiatives to continue to positively impact our productivity and result in a more efficient infrastructure that we can leverage when demand growth returns 
additionally  we continue to seek opportunities to gain market share in markets we currently serve  expand into new markets and develop new product features in order to mitigate the impact of reduced demand as well as broaden our sales base 
in addition to challenges with overall demand  volatility in the cost of raw materials is ongoing 
while the cost of commodity raw materials declined in the second half of  we currently expect these costs to continue to be volatile in if raw material prices increase  we may not be able to fully recover the cost by passing them on to our customers through price increases due to the competitive nature of the markets we serve and the depressed economic conditions 
liquidity and capital resources summary 
our primary source of liquidity on an on going basis is our cash flow from operating activities  which is generally used to i fund capital expenditures  ii repay short term or long term indebtedness incurred primarily for working capital  capital expenditures or reducing our outstanding stock and iii provide for the payment of dividends if declared 
from time to time  we will incur indebtedness  primarily for short term working capital needs  or to fund capital expenditures or business combinations 
in addition  from time to time  we may also sell assets outside the ordinary course of business  the proceeds of which are generally used to repay indebtedness including indebtedness which may have been collateralized by the assets sold or to fund capital expenditures or business combinations 
consolidated cash flows 
operating activities 
trends in cash flows from operating activities  excluding changes in assets and liabilities  for  and have generally been similar to the trends in our earnings 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased in compared to  and in compared to due to the timing of capital expenditures placed into service each year 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
changes in assets and liabilities result primarily from the timing of production  sales and purchases 
such changes in assets and liabilities generally tend to even out over time 
however  year to year relative changes in assets and liabilities can significantly affect the comparability of cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  an increase of million over cash provided by operating activities 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to is primarily the net result of higher operating income in of approximately  exclusive of the million goodwill impairment charge  lower depreciation and amortization in of million  lower net cash provided by relative changes in our inventories  receivables  payables and non tax related accruals of million in lower cash paid for income taxes in of million due to lower repatriations of non us earnings in  higher cash paid for interest in of million due to the october issuance of our promissory note to an affiliate  and lower interest income of approximately  in due to lower average cash balances during resulting from the use of excess cash to prepay principle on our promissory note 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  a decrease of million over cash provided by operating activities 
the decrease in our cash provided by operating activities in as compared to is primarily the result of higher cash paid for income taxes in of million primarily relating to us taxes on dividends repatriated from our us subsidiaries  lower operating income of million  and a million decrease in in cash provided by relative changes in assets and liabilities excluding taxes primarily due to higher raw materials costs resulting in an increase in our inventory balance 
our average days sales outstanding dso at december  was days compared to days at december  the decrease is primarily due to the timing of collections on a lower accounts receivable balance as of december  for comparative purposes  our average dso was days for december  and days at december  our average number of days in inventory dii was days at december  and days at december  the increase in dii is primarily due to lower sales in the fourth quarter of which impacted the dii calculation although in absolute terms  we reduced inventory by million from to for comparative purposes our average dii was days at december  and days at december  the increase is primarily due to the higher cost of commodity raw materials during and higher inventory balances associated with the facility consolidation in investing activities 
net cash used by investing activities totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures in the past three years have primarily emphasized improving our manufacturing facilities and investing in manufacturing equipment which utilizes new technologies and increases automation of the manufacturing process to provide for increased productivity and efficiency 
during  we constructed a new facility and consolidated three of our northern illinois facilities into one facility at a cost of approximately million 
as a part of the facility consolidation project  the lake bluff  illinois facility was sold in for approximately million which approximated book value and was leased back until we vacated the facility in october the river grove  illinois facility is no longer being utilized and is being actively marketed for sale 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  we built a new facility for one of our marine components subsidiaries at a cost of million 
the facility is expected to provide the subsidiary with sufficient capacity to take advantage of sales growth opportunities in the future 
in april  we completed the acquisition of a marine component products business for million  net of cash acquired 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in april of   and we collected payments of million  respectively  related to the sale of our european thomas regout operations  completed in  which required annual payments over a period of four years 
capital expenditure projects in emphasized improved production efficiency including million spent to replace our waste water treatment equipment at our south carolina facility 
capital expenditures for are estimated at approximately million compared to capital expenditures of million in and million in we have lowered our planned capital expenditures in in response to the current economic conditions and are limiting investments to those expenditures required to meet the lower expected customer demand and those required to properly maintain our facilities 
capital spending for is expected to be funded through cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
financing activities 
net cash used by financing activities totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
cash dividends paid totaled million  million  and million 
per share in   and  respectively 
dividends paid decreased in as a result of the repurchase and or cancellation of a net million shares of our class a common stock held by timet  an affiliate in the fourth quarter of we purchased these shares for per share  or aggregate consideration of million  which we paid in the form of a consolidated promissory note 
we prepaid approximately million and million toward the promissory note in and  respectively 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in  we repurchased approximately  shares of our class a common stock in market transactions for an aggregate of million 
in  we also repurchased approximately  shares of our class a common stock in market transactions for an aggregate of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in we prepaid million of indebtedness we assumed in our marine components acquisition 
in january  we amended our secured revolving bank credit facility which extended the facility until january  additionally  we reduced the size of the credit facility from million to million  which more appropriately reflects our potential borrowing needs 
the credit facility is collateralized by of the ownership interests in our first tier non united states subsidiaries 
provisions contained in our revolving bank credit agreement could result in the acceleration of outstanding indebtedness prior to its stated maturity for reasons other than defaults from failing to comply with typical financial covenants 
for example  our credit agreement allows the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined of the borrower 
the terms of the credit agreement could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside of the ordinary course of business 
at december  we had no balances outstanding under the facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other than certain operating leases discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries or affiliates are parties to any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under our credit agreement  together with cash on hand  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and dividends if declared 
to the extent that our actual operating results or other developments differ from our expectations  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
we periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and available resources in view of  among other things  our capital expenditure requirements  dividend policy and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  we have in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  issue additional securities  repurchase shares of our common stock  modify our dividend policy or take a combination of such steps to manage our liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  we may review opportunities for acquisitions  joint ventures or other business combinations in the component products industry 
in the event of any such transaction  we may consider using available cash  issuing additional equity securities or increasing our indebtedness or that of our subsidiaries  however  there are no assurances that we could obtain additional financing on favorable terms 
contractual obligations 
as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we are a party to various debt  lease and other agreements which contractually and unconditionally commit the company to pay certain amounts in the future 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes such contractual commitments as of december  by the type and date of payment 
payments due by period total and after in thousands note and interest payable to affiliate operating leases purchase obligations income taxes fixed asset acquisitions total contractual cash obligations the timing and amount shown for our commitments related to long term debt  operating leases and fixed asset acquisitions are based upon the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for those commitments 
the timing and amount shown for purchase obligations  which consist of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations primarily commitments to purchase raw materials is also based on the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for those commitments 
the amount shown for income taxes is the consolidated amount of income taxes payable at december   which is assumed to be paid during fixed asset acquisitions include firm purchase commitments for capital projects

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and raw materials prices 
interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december  and  we had no amounts outstanding under our secured revolving bank credit agreement 
in conjunction with the repurchase and or cancellation of a net million shares of our class a common stock  during the fourth quarter of  we issued a promissory note for million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   there was million outstanding on the promissory note million at december  which bears interest at libor plus  and and december  and  respectively and the fair value of such indebtedness approximates its carrying value 
the interest rate is reset quarterly based on the three month libor 
currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling our products outside the united states principally canada and taiwan 
a portion of our sales generated from our non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a portion of our sales generated from our non us operations are denominated in the us dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for these non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
as a result  the translated us dollar value of our non us sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
as already mentioned certain of our sales generated by our canadian operations are denominated in us dollars 
consequently  we periodically enter into forward currency contracts to mitigate the financial statement impact of changes in currency exchange rates 
at each balance sheet date  outstanding forward currency contracts are marked to market with any resulting gain or loss recognized in income currently unless the contract is designated as a hedge upon which the mark to market adjustment is recorded in other comprehensive income 
to manage a portion of the currency exchange rate market risk associated with receivables  or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales  at december  we had entered into a series of short term forward currency exchange contracts to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent value of canadian dollars at exchange rates of cdn 
to per us dollar 
these contracts qualified for hedge accounting and mature through june at december   the actual exchange rate was cdn 
per us dollar 
the estimated fair value of such contracts was not material at december  we had no forward currency contracts outstanding at december  raw materials 
we will occasionally enter into raw material arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
otherwise  we generally do not have long term supply agreements for our raw material requirements because either we believe the risk of unavailability of those raw materials is low and we believe the price to be stable or because long term supply agreements for those materials are generally not available 
we do not engage in commodity hedging programs 
other 
the above discussion includes forward looking statements of market risk which assumes hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be our projections of future events  gains or losses 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties some of which are listed in business general
