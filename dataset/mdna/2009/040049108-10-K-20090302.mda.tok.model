item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are engaged in oil and natural gas acquisition  exploration and exploitation activities in the states of oklahoma  texas  new mexico and kansas 
over the last six years  we have emphasized the acquisition of properties that provided current production and upside potential through further development 
we have increased our reserves significantly by investing approximately million in acquisitions and development in  following total capital expenditures of approximately million in and million in we will closely manage our capital expenditures to our cash flow 
as commodity prices change we will consider the resulting impact on our cash flow and adjust our capital expenditures accordingly  be it up or down 
we also intend to continue seeking acquisition opportunities which compliment our current portfolio 
we could draw on our credit facility or funds derived from future equity transactions for future acquisitions 
our business plan has involved increasing our base of proven reserves until we have acquired a sufficient core to enable us to utilize cash from existing production to fund further development activities 
when we originated our business plan we believed this would allow us to lessen our risks  including risks associated with borrowing funds to undertake exploration activities at an earlier time 
we increased our base of proven properties and initiated development activities as oil and natural gas prices increased 
while our focus has shifted to include more development activity  we plan to continue our strategy of acquiring producing properties with additional development  exploitation and exploration potential 
our focus has been on acquiring operated properties ie properties with respect to which we serve as the operator on behalf of all joint interest owners so that we can better control the timing and implementation of capital spending 
our revenue  profitability and future growth rate depend substantially on factors beyond our control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy 
oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and may fluctuate widely in the future 
sustained periods of low prices for oil or natural gas could materially and adversely affect our financial position  our results of operations  the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically produce and our access to capital 
in a worst case scenario  future drilling operations could be largely unsuccessful  oil and gas prices could further decline and or other factors beyond our control could cause us to greatly modify or substantially curtail our development plans  which could negatively impact our earnings  cash flow and most likely the trading price of our securities  as well as the acceleration of debt repayment and a reduction in our borrowing base under our credit facilities 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected operating data for the periods indicated for the years ended december  net production oil bbls    natural gas mcf    net sales oil    natural gas    average sales price oil per bbl natural gas per mcf production costs and expenses oil and gas production costs    production taxes    realized loss on oil derivative   depreciation  depletion and amortization expense    accretion expense    general and administrative expenses    year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas sales 
oil and natural gas sales revenue increased approximately million to million in oil sales increased million and natural gas sales increased million 
the oil sales increase was caused by a sales volume increase of  barrels in  and a increase in the average realized per barrel oil price from in to in these per barrel amounts are calculated by dividing revenue from oil sales by the volume of oil sold  in barrels 
the natural gas sales increase was caused by a sales volume increase of  mcf in  and a increase in the average realized per barrel oil price from in to in these per mcf amounts are calculated by dividing revenue from gas sales by the volume of gas sold  in mcf 
the volume increase for crude oil and natural gas primarily resulted from development of our existing properties in oil and gas production costs 
our aggregate oil and gas production costs increased from  in to  and increased on a boe basis from in to in these per boe amounts are calculated by dividing our total production costs by our total volume sold  in boe 
this aggregate increase was the result of the drilling of new wells in and cost increases 
the increase on a per boe basis is attributable to rising rates for labor and services 
oil and gas production taxes 
oil and gas production taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales were during and decreased to in production taxes vary from state to state 
therefore  these taxes are likely to vary in the future depending on the mix of production we generate from various states  and on the possibility that any state may raise its production tax 
realized loss on oil derivative 
realized loss on oil derivative increased from  in to  in this increase is the result of commodity price increases during most of depreciation  depletion and amortization 
our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased by  to  in the increase was a result of an increase in the average depreciation  depletion and amortization rate from per boe during to per boe during these per boe amounts are calculated by dividing our total depreciation  depletion and amortization expense by our total volume sold  in boe 
the increased depreciation  depletion and amortization were the result of increased sales volume and an increase in estimated future development costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by  to  during this increase was primarily related to increases in compensation expense associated with an increase in personnel required to administer our growth and compensation expense related to our stock option plan as a result of the adoption of fasb r 
interest income 
interest income increased  to  in the increase was due to higher cash balances during periods of the year in interest expense 
interest expense decreased  to  in the increase was due to lower amounts of debt being outstanding during periods of the year in income tax expense 
our effective tax rate was during and during net income 
net income increased from  for to  for the primary reasons for this increase include higher crude oil and natural gas prices between periods and an increase in volumes sold  partially offset by higher oil and gas production costs  oil and gas production taxes and general and administrative expenses due to our growth 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas sales 
oil and natural gas sales revenue increased approximately million to million in oil sales increased million and natural gas sales increased million 
the oil sales increase was caused by a sales volume increase of  barrels in  and a increase in the average realized per barrel oil price from in to in these per barrel amounts are calculated by dividing revenue from oil sales by the volume of oil sold  in barrels

therefore  these taxes are likely to vary in the future depending on the mix of production we generate from various states  and on the possibility that any state may raise its production tax 
realized loss on oil derivative 
realized loss on oil derivative increased from in to  in this increase is the result of the company not having any derivative outstanding during and putting one in place during depreciation  depletion and amortization 
our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased by  to  in the increase was a result of an increase in the average depreciation  depletion and amortization rate from per boe during to per boe during these per boe amounts are calculated by dividing our total depreciation  depletion and amortization expense by our total volume sold  in boe 
the increased depreciation  depletion and amortization were the result of increased sales volume and an increase in estimated future development costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by  to  during this increase was primarily related to increases in compensation expense associated with an increase in personnel required to administer our growth and compensation expense related to our stock option plan as a result of the adoption of fasb r 
other financing expense 
other financing expense was in  compared to  in the reduction is the result of the completion in of the stock offering to which this financing expense related

liquidity and capital resources historical financing 
we have historically funded our operations through equity offerings of our stock and warrants in  and credit facility 
in april  we entered into a credit agreement establishing a credit facility at  with a borrowing base of  this agreement replaced the previous credit agreement we had in place 
the interest rate was a floating rate equal to the  or day libor rate plus  payable monthly 
amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility are due in may the revolving credit facility is secured by our principal mineral interests 
the bank credit facility is subject to borrowing base availability  which is redetermined semiannually based on the banks estimates of the future net cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties 
we are required under the terms of the credit facility to maintain a to ratio of income before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization to interest expense  maintain a current asset to current liability ratio of to and a rolling four quarter maximum leverage ratio of no more than to in june  we entered into a new agreement that increased the borrowing base under our credit facility to  while leaving the credit facility at  additionally  the interest rate was changed to be a floating rate equal to the  or day libor rate plus 
in june  we entered into an amended agreement that increased the borrowing base under our credit facility to  while leaving the credit facility at  all other terms and conditions remained the same 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and did not have any amount outstanding under this credit facility 
cash flows 
our primary sources of cash have been cash flows from operations and equity offerings 
during the three years ended december   we generated  from operating activities and financed  through proceeds from the sale of stock and warrants and exercise of warrants and options 
we primarily used this cash generation to fund our capital expenditures and development aggregating  over the three years end december  at december   we had cash on hand of  and working capital of  compared to december  when our cash was  with working capital of  we continually evaluate our capital needs and compare them to our capital resources 
we will closely manage our capital expenditures to our cash flow 
as commodity prices change we will consider the resulting impact on our cash flow and adjust our capital expenditures accordingly  be it up or down 
the level of capital expenditures is largely discretionary  and the amount of funds devoted to any particular activity may increase or decrease significantly depending on available opportunities  commodity prices  cash flows and development results  among others 
schedule of contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our future estimated lease payments for periods subsequent to december  this lease pertains to an office building in midland  texas and involves approximately  square feet of space 
year lease obligation off balance sheet financing arrangements as of december  we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
new accounting policies in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  and the adoption did not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
see note for other disclosures required by sfas no 
in february  the fasb issued fsp sfas no 
which delays the effective date of sfas no 
for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this deferral of sfas no 
primarily applies to our asset retirement obligation aro  which uses fair value measures at the date incurred to determine our liability 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption in of sfas no 
non recurring fair value measures 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 effective on january   and permits companies to choose  at specified dates  to measure certain eligible financial instruments at fair value 
the provisions of sfas no 
apply only to entities that elect to use the fair value option and to all entities with available for sale and trading securities 
at the effective date  companies may elect the fair value option for eligible items that exist at that date  and the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value must be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
effective january   the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions 
the company has analyzed its filing positions in all jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns for the open tax years in such jurisdictions 
the company has identified its federal income tax return and its state income tax returns in texas  new mexico  oklahoma and kansas in which it operates as major tax jurisdictions 
the company s federal income tax returns for the years ended december  through remain subject to examination 
the company s income tax returns in major state income tax jurisdictions remain subject to examination for years ended december  through  with the exception of texas  which would also include the year ended december  the company currently believes that all significant filing positions are highly certain and that all of its significant income tax filing positions and deductions would be sustained upon audit 
therefore  the company has no significant reserves for uncertain tax positions and no adjustments to such reserves were required upon adoption of fin no interest or penalties have been levied against the company and none are anticipated  therefore interest or penalty has been included in our provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our financial statements 
the preparation of these statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and other sources that we believe to be reasonable at the time 
actual results may vary from our estimates due to changes in circumstances  weather  politics  global economics  mechanical problems  general business conditions and other factors 
our significant accounting policies are detailed in note to our financial statements included in this annual report 
we have outlined below certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
revenue recognition 
we predominantly derive our revenue from the sale of produced crude oil and natural gas 
revenue is recorded in the month the product is delivered to the purchaser 
we receive payment from one to three months after delivery 
at the end of each month  we estimate the amount of production delivered to purchasers and the price we will receive 
variances between our estimated revenue and actual payment are recorded in the month the payment is received  however  differences have been insignificant 
full cost method of accounting 
we account for our oil and natural gas operations using the full cost method of accounting 
under this method  all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
costs capitalized include acquisition costs  geological and geophysical expenditures  lease rentals on undeveloped properties and cost of drilling and equipping productive and non productive wells 
drilling costs include directly related overhead costs 
all of our properties are located within the continental united states 
oil and natural gas reserve quantities 
reserve quantities and the related estimates of future net cash flows affect our periodic calculations of depletion and impairment of our oil and natural gas properties 
proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
reserve quantities and future cash flows included in this annual report are prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the sec and fasb 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the persons preparing the estimates 
our proved reserve information included in this annual report were based on internal reports and audited by lee keeling and associates  inc kansas and oklahoma properties and williamson petroleum consultants  inc new mexico and texas properties  independent petroleum engineers 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may differ substantially from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
we continually make revisions to reserve estimates throughout the year as additional properties are acquired 
we make changes to depletion rates and impairment calculations in the same period that changes to the reserve estimates are made 
all capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  including estimated future costs to develop proved reserves and estimated future costs of site restoration  are amortized on the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserves as determined by independent engineers 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties 
we review the value of our oil and natural gas properties whenever management judges that events and circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of properties may not be recoverable 
we provide for impairments on undeveloped property when we determine that the property will not be developed or a permanent impairment in value has occurred 
impairments of proved producing properties are calculated by comparing future net undiscounted cash flows using escalated prices to the net recorded book cost at the end of each period ceiling test 
if the net capitalized cost exceeds net future cash flows  the cost of the property is written down to fair value  which is determined using net discounted future cash flows from the producing property 
current market conditions  in the form of low commodity prices  have had a dramatic effect on this calculation 
the net discounted future cash flow from producing properties is directly impacted by commodity prices 
different pricing assumptions or discount rates could result in a different calculated impairment 
we have never recorded property impairments as a result of the ceiling test 
our reserve estimates as of december  are based on an average price of for oil and for gas 
we have run an impairment test analysis to determine at approximately what price level impairment would result 
because our reserves are predominantly oil  at approximately of total reserves  this analysis was based solely on the oil price while leaving gas prices at the levels used as of december  based on this analysis  our contracted oil price would have to drop below per barrel for the ceiling test to result in impairment to our producing properties 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the carrying amount in our financial statements 
this difference will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is settled 
since our tax returns are filed after the financial statements are prepared  estimates are required in valuing tax assets and liabilities 
we record adjustments to actual in the period we file our tax returns 
derivative instruments 
the estimated fair values of our commodity derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
at inception  all of our commodity derivative instruments represent hedges of the price of future oil and gas production 
the changes in fair value of those derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced 
if a hedge becomes ineffective because the hedged production does not occur  or the hedge otherwise does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in the income statement as derivative income or expense 
our hedges are specifically referenced to nymex prices 
we evaluate the effectiveness of our hedges at the time we enter the contracts  and periodically over the life of the contracts  by analyzing the correlation between nymex prices and the posted prices we receive from our designated production 
through this analysis  we are able to determine if a high correlation exists between the prices received for the designated production and the nymex prices at which the hedges will be settled 
at december   our derivative instruments were considered effective cash flow hedges 
effects of inflation and pricing we did experience increases in costs during due to increased demand for oil field products and services 
the oil and natural gas industry is very cyclical and the demand for goods and services of oil field companies  suppliers and others associated with the industry puts extreme pressure on the economic stability and pricing structure within the industry 
typically  as prices for oil and natural gas increase  so do all associated costs  and this proved to be the case in as oil and gas prices rose significantly 
costs for oilfield services and materials increased during due to higher demand as a result of the higher oil and gas prices 
material changes in prices impact the current revenue stream  estimates of future reserves  borrowing base calculations of bank loans and value of properties in purchase and sale transactions 
material changes in prices can impact the value of oil and natural gas companies and their ability to raise capital  borrow money and retain personnel 
we anticipate business costs will vary in accordance with commodity prices for oil and natural gas  and the associated increase or decrease in demand for services related to production and exploration 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk commodity price risk our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing domestic price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to the region in which we produce natural gas 
historically  prices received for oil and natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
we expect pricing volatility to continue 
oil prices we received during ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel 
natural gas prices we received during ranged from a low of 
per mcf to a high of per mcf 
a significant decline in the prices of oil or natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december  the company s only current derivative contract is a costless collar 
a collar is a contract which combines both a put option or floor and a call option or ceiling 
the company receives the excess  if any  of the floor price over the reference price  based on nymex quoted prices  and pays the excess  if any  of the reference price over the ceiling price 
the following is information relating to the company s collar position as of december commodity remaining period volume floor ceiling wti crude oil january december  the change in fair value of the oil hedging contract in place at december   resulted in a net asset of  the after tax impact of the change in the fair value of the hedge of  is reflected in other comprehensive income as unrealized gain on oil derivative for the period ended december  changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  to the extent they are effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk  are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any change in fair value from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in unrealized derivative gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
cash settlements of cash flow hedges are recorded as a gain or loss on derivatives in the operating section of the company s statement of operations 
our statement of operations includes a loss on derivative instrument of  for and  for interest rate risk our current credit facility has a floating interest rate 
therefore  if we draw funds on this credit facility  interest rate changes will impact future results of operations and cash flows
