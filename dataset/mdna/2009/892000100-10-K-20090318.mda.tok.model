critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
in preparing the financial statements  we utilized available information  including our past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming our estimates and judgments  giving due consideration to materiality 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to other companies in our industry 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and estimation 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we normally enter into contractual agreements with our customers for periods ranging between one to three years 
we recognize the total revenue provided under a contract ratably over the contract period  including any periods under which we have agreed to provide services at no cost 
deferred revenues are recognized as a liability when billings are received in advance of the date when revenues are earned 
we apply the revenue recognition principles set forth under sec staff accounting bulletin  sab which provides for revenue to be recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery or installation has been completed  iii the customer accepts and verifies receipt  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
long lived assets 
long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment  and fcc licenses 
long lived assets are reviewed annually for impairment or whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable 
conditions that would result in an impairment charge include a significant decline in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
when such events or circumstances arise  an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows produced by the asset  or the appropriate grouping of assets  is compared to the asset s carrying value to determine if impairment exists pursuant to the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if the asset is determined to be impaired  the impairment loss is measured based on the excess of its carrying value over its fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying value or net realizable value 
asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  fas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
fas requires the recognition of an asset retirement obligation and an associated asset retirement cost when there is a legal obligation in connection with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
our network equipment is installed on both buildings in which we have a lease agreement company locations and at customer locations 
in both instances  the installation and removal of our equipment is not complicated and does not require structural changes to the building where the equipment is installed 
costs associated with the removal of our equipment at company or customer locations are not material  and accordingly  we have determined that we do not presently have asset retirement obligations under fas off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities known as special purposes entities 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  fas which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and for interim periods within those years 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the related disclosure requirements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the statement indicates  among other things  that a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or  in the absence of a principal market  the most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
fas defines fair value based upon an exit price model

 accounting for leases  fas and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions  while fsp delays the effective date of fas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
fsp c clarifies the principles in fas on the fair value measurement of liabilities 
we adopted fas as of january   with the exception of the application of the statement to nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities 
while we are currently evaluating the impact of the application of the statement to nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption  we do not anticipate a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement  fsp apb 
fsp apb specifies that for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion  issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in the statement of financial condition 
the excess of the initial proceeds of the convertible debt instrument over the amount allocated to the liability component creates a debt discount which should be amortized as interest expense over the expected life of the liability
