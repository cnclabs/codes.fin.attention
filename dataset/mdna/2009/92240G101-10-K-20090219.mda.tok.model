item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition in this discussion and analysis  the company analyzes contributions to consolidated earnings and earnings per share from its utility group and nonutility group separately since each operates independently requiring distinct competencies and business strategies  offers different energy and energy related products and services  and experiences different opportunities and risks 
nonutility group operations are discussed below as primary operations  other operations  and synfuel related results 
primary nonutility operations denote areas of management s forward looking focus 
tax laws authorizing tax credits for the production of certain synthetic fuels expired on december  per share earnings contributions of the utility group  nonutility group  and corporate and other are presented 
such per share amounts are based on the earnings contribution of each group included in vectren s consolidated results divided by vectren s basic average shares outstanding during the period 
the earnings per share of the groups do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to the groups  but rather represent a direct equity interest in vectren corporation s assets and liabilities as a whole 
these non gaap measures are used by management to evaluate the performance of individual businesses 
accordingly management believes these measures are useful to investors in understanding each business contribution to consolidated earnings per share and analyzing period to period changes 
the utility group generates revenue primarily from the delivery of natural gas and electric service to its customers 
the primary source of cash flow for the utility group results from the collection of customer bills and the payment for goods and services procured for the delivery of gas and electric services 
the activities of and revenues and cash flows generated by the nonutility group are closely linked to the utility industry  and the results of those operations are generally impacted by factors similar to those impacting the overall utility industry 
in addition  there are other operations  referred to herein as corporate and other  that include unallocated corporate expenses such as advertising and charitable contributions  among other activities 
the company has in place a disclosure committee that consists of senior management as well as financial management 
the committee is actively involved in the preparation and review of the company s sec filings 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
executive summary of consolidated results of operations year ended december  in millions  except per share data net income attributed to utility group nonutility group corporate other basic earnings per share attributed to utility group nonutility group corporate other results for the year ended december   earnings were million  or per share  compared to million  or per share in  and million  or per share  in while utility results increased in compared to primarily as a result of base rate increases  results reflect decreased earnings from nonutility operations  primarily proliance and coal mining 
additionally  as more fully described below  includes an approximate per share impairment charge associated with legacy nonutility commercial real estate investments 

table of contents the increase in earnings compared to is primarily attributable to higher gas and electric utility margins and increased earnings from the sale of wholesale power 
results in also reflect increased earnings from the company s nonutility operations  primarily energy marketing and services  energy infrastructure services  and increased synfuel related results 
utility group in  the utility group s earnings were million compared to million in the percent increase in utility earnings is due primarily to a full year of base rate changes in the indiana service territories and increased earnings from wholesale power operations 
increases were offset somewhat by increased operating costs associated with maintenance and reliability programs contemplated in the base rate cases and favorable weather in in compared to  the increase in utility group earnings primarily resulted from base rate increases in the vectren south service territory  the combined impact of residential and commercial usage and lost margin recovery  favorable weather  and increased wholesale power margins 
the increase was offset somewhat by increased operating costs including depreciation expense in and a lower effective tax rate in in the company s electric and ohio natural gas service territories which are not protected by weather normalization mechanisms  management estimates the margin impact of weather to be approximately million favorable or per share compared to year normal temperatures in in management estimates a million favorable impact on margin compared to normal or per share  and in an million unfavorable impact on margin compared to normal or per share 
nonutility group the nonutility group s earnings were million in  compared to earnings of million in and million in the company s primary nonutility operations contributed million  compared to million in and million in primary nonutility operations are energy marketing and services companies  coal mining operations  and energy infrastructure services companies 
in compared to  primary nonutility group results decreased million 
coal mining operated at a loss and results were approximately million lower than the prior year due primarily to lower production and increased operating costs 
proliance s earnings were million lower than the prior year and reflect lower operating results as well as a reserve for the ferc matter described herein 
the results from the other primary nonutility operations also reflect increased earnings from performance contracting and renewable energy construction operations performed through energy systems group and retail gas marketing operations performed through vectren source 
miller pipeline s miller results were generally flat compared to the prior year  which was a record year in terms of earnings contribution 
primary nonutility group results increased million in compared to the increase was primarily attributable to higher miller earnings and the unfavorable impact of the proliance litigation settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of totaling million 
the increased contribution from miller of million is due largely to more large gas construction projects  pricing increases  and vectren s percent ownership of miller in earnings from energy systems group and vectren source were also favorable year over year 
operating earnings from proliance were down year over year by million as the favorable impact of their increased storage capacity was more than offset by lower volatility in the wholesale natural gas markets 
coal mining earnings were million in compared to million in primarily due to compliance with new mine safety and health administration msha seal and safety guidelines and the associated lost production and higher sulfur content from coal mined under the revised mining plan 

table of contents other nonutility businesses operated at a loss of million in  compared to earnings of million in and a loss of million in other nonutility businesses include legacy investments  including investments in commercial real estate and also included the company s former investment in sigecom  llc 
as a result of the economy impacting commercial real estate  during  the company recorded an impairment charge associated with its commercial real estate investments totaling million  million after tax  or per share 
in  the company sold its investment in sigecom  llc at a loss of approximately million after tax 
in  the last year of synfuel operations  synfuel related results generated earnings of million 
of those earnings  which do not continue into and beyond  million million on a pre tax basis was contributed to the vectren foundation 
net of that contribution  synfuel related results were million  or per share  in  compared to a loss of million  or per share  in in  synfuel related activity includes a million after tax impairment charge related to the company s investment in pace carbon synfuels lp 
the foundation contribution is included in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
dividends dividends declared for the year ended december  were per share compared to in and per share in in october  the company s board of directors increased its quarterly dividend to per share from per share 
the increase marks the th consecutive year vectren and predecessor companies have increased annual dividends paid 
ice storm on january   a major ice storm in the company s southern indiana territory resulted in an extended disruption of electricity to approximately  of the company s  electric customers 
electricity was restored to substantially all customers within one week 
management estimates the total cost of restoration could approximate to million  the majority of which is expected to be capitalized as utility plant 
detailed discussion of results of operations following is a more detailed discussion of the results of operations of the company s utility and nonutility operations 
the detailed results of operations for these operations are presented and analyzed before the reclassification and elimination of certain intersegment transactions necessary to consolidate those results into the company s consolidated statements of income 

table of contents results of operations of the utility group the utility group is comprised of utility holdings operations 
the operations of the utility group consist of the company s regulated operations and other operations that provide information technology and other support services to those regulated operations 
regulated operations consist of a natural gas distribution business that provides natural gas distribution and transportation services to nearly two thirds of indiana and to west central ohio and an electric transmission and distribution business  which provides electric distribution services primarily to southwestern indiana  and the company s power generating and wholesale power operations 
in total  these regulated operations supply natural gas and or electricity to over one million customers 
utility group operating results before certain intersegment eliminations and reclassifications for the years ended december    and  follow year ended december  in millions  except per share data operating revenues gas utility electric utility other total operating revenues operating expenses cost of gas sold cost of fuel purchased power other operating depreciation amortization taxes other than income taxes total operating expenses operating income other income net interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income contribution to vectren basic eps significant fluctuations utility group margin throughout this discussion  the terms gas utility margin and electric utility margin are used 
gas utility margin is calculated as gas utility revenues less the cost of gas 
electric utility margin is calculated as electric utility revenues less cost of fuel purchased power 
the company believes gas utility and electric utility margins are better indicators of relative contribution than revenues since gas prices and fuel costs can be volatile and are generally collected on a dollar for dollar basis from customers 
sales of natural gas and electricity to residential and commercial customers are seasonal and are impacted by weather 
trends in average use among natural gas residential and commercial customers have tended to decline in recent years as more efficient appliances and furnaces are installed and the price of natural gas has increased 
normal temperature adjustment nta and lost margin recovery mechanisms largely mitigate the effect on gas utility margin that would otherwise be caused by variations in volumes sold to these customers due to weather and changing consumption patterns 
indiana gas territory has both an nta since and lost margin recovery since december sigeco s natural gas territory has an nta since  and lost margin recovery began when new base rates went into effect august  the ohio service territory had lost margin recovery since october the ohio lost margin recovery mechanism ended when new base rates went into effect in february this mechanism was replaced by a rate design  commonly referred to as a straight fixed variable rate design  which is more dependent on service charge revenues and less dependent on volumetric revenues than previous rate designs 
this new rate design  which will be phased in over a two year period  also prospectively mitigates some weather risk in ohio 
sigeco s electric service territory has neither nta nor lost margin recovery mechanisms 

table of contents gas and electric margin generated from sales to large customers generally industrial and other contract customers is primarily impacted by overall economic conditions and changes in demand for those customers products 
the recent recession may have some negative impact on both gas and electric large customers 
this impact may include tempered growth  significant conservation measures  and perhaps even plant closures or bankruptcies 
while no one industrial customer comprises percent of consolidated revenues  the top five industrial electric customers comprise approximately percent of electric utility revenues  and therefore any significant decline in their collective revenues could adversely impact operating results 
deteriorating economic conditions may also lead to continued lower residential and commercial customer counts 
margin is also impacted by the collection of state mandated taxes  which fluctuate with gas and fuel costs  as well as other tracked expenses 
expenses subject to tracking mechanisms include ohio bad debts and percent of income payment plan expenses  indiana gas pipeline integrity management costs  and costs to fund indiana energy efficiency programs 
certain operating costs associated with operating environmental compliance equipment were also tracked prior to their recovery in base rates that went into effect on august  the latest indiana service territory rate cases  implemented in and also provide for the tracking of miso revenues and costs  as well as the gas cost component of bad debt expense based on historical experience and unaccounted for gas 
unaccounted for gas is also tracked in the ohio service territory 
electric wholesale activities are primarily affected by market conditions  the level of excess generating capacity  and electric transmission availability 
following is a discussion and analysis of margin generated from regulated utility operations 
gas utility margin gas utility revenues less cost of gas gas utility margin and throughput by customer type follows year ended december  in millions gas utility revenues cost of gas sold total gas utility margin margin attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers other sold transported volumes in mmdth attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers total sold transported volumes for the year ended december   gas utility margins were million  an increase of million compared to the vectren north base rate increase  effective february  added million in margin 
also impacting year over year results was the vectren south base rate increase  effective august   increasing margin for the full year approximately million 
in  ohio weather was percent colder than the prior year and resulted in an estimated increase in margin of approximately million compared to operating costs  including revenue and usage taxes  directly recovered in margin  increased gas margin million 
the average cost per dekatherm of gas purchased for the year ended december   was compared to in and in 
table of contents gas utility margins increased million in compared to residential and commercial customer usage  including lost margin recovery  increased margin million year over year 
for all of  ohio weather was percent warmer than normal  but approximately percent colder than the prior year and resulted in an estimated increase in margin of approximately million compared to margin increases associated with the vectren south base rate increase  effective august   were million 
recovery of gas storage carrying costs in ohio was million 
lastly  operating costs  including revenue and usage taxes  directly recovered in margin increased gas margin million year over year 
during  the company resolved all remaining issues related to a disallowance by the puco of gas costs incurred by the ohio utility operations  resulting in an additional charge of million 
electric utility margin electric utility revenues less cost of fuel and purchased power electric utility margin and volumes sold by customer type follows year ended december  in millions electric utility revenues cost of fuel purchased power total electric utility margin margin attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers municipals other customers subtotal retail wholesale margin electric volumes sold in gwh attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers municipals other total retail firm wholesale volumes sold retail electric retail utility margin was million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million compared to the base rate increase that went into effect on august   produced incremental margin of million year over year when netted with municipal contracts that were allowed to expire 
management estimates the year over year decreases in usage by residential and commercial customers due to weather  which was very warm the prior summer  to be million 
other usage declines due in part to a weakening economy and conservation measures were the primary reason for the remaining decrease 
in  electric retail utility margins increased million when compared to management estimates the year over year increases in usage by residential and commercial customers due to weather to be million 
the base rate increase that went into effect on august   produced incremental margin of million 
during  cooling degree days were percent above normal compared to percent below normal in recovery of pollution control investments and expenses increased margin million year over year 
margin from wholesale activities periodically  generation capacity is in excess of native load 
the company markets and sells this unutilized generating and transmission capacity to optimize the return on its owned assets 
a majority of the margin generated from these activities is associated with wholesale off system sales  and substantially all off system sales occur into the miso day ahead and real time markets 

table of contents further detail of wholesale activity follows year ended december  in millions off system sales  net of sharing in transmission system sales other total wholesale margin for the year ended december   wholesale margins were million  representing an increase of million  compared to during  margin from off system sales retained by the company increased million 
the company experienced higher wholesale power marketing margins due to the increase in off peak volumes available for sale off system  driven primarily by expiring municipal contracts  and increases in wholesale prices 
the base rate case effective august   requires that wholesale margin from off system sales earned above or below million be shared equally with customers  and results reflect the impact of that sharing 
off system sales totaled  gwh in  compared to gwh in and gwh in beginning in june  the company began earning a return on electric transmission projects constructed by the company in its service territory that benefit reliability throughout the region 
these returns primarily account for the year over year increase of million in transmission system sales 
for the year ended december   wholesale margins were million  which represents an increase of million  compared to the increase is primarily due to losses on financial contracts experienced in and higher fourth quarter wholesale prices 
in  the availability of excess capacity was reduced by scheduled outages associated with the installation of environmental compliance equipment 
utility group operating expenses other operating for the year ended december   other operating expenses were million  which represents an increase of million  compared to costs in resulting from increased maintenance and other reliability activities  including amortization of prior deferred costs contemplated in base rate increases  increased approximately million year over year 
operating costs that are directly recovered in utility margin increased million year over year 
costs associated with lower performance compensation and share based compensation and other cost reductions partially offset these increases 
in  other operating expenses increased million compared to operating costs that are directly recovered in utility margin  including costs funding indiana energy efficiency programs  increased million year over year 
increases in operating costs associated with lost margin recovery and conservation initiatives that are not directly recovered in margin increased million year over year 
costs directly attributable to the vectren south rate cases  including amortization of prior deferred costs  totaled million in expenses in are offset by the gain on the sale of a storage asset of approximately million 
the remaining increases are primarily due to increased wage and benefit costs 
depreciation amortization depreciation expense increased million in compared to as well as in compared to expense in and includes million and million  respectively of increased amortization associated with prior electric demand side management costs pursuant to the august  electric base rate order 
the remaining increases are also attributable to increased utility plant in service 

table of contents taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes increased million in compared to and increased million in compared the increases are primarily attributable to higher utility receipts  excise  and usage taxes 
these variations resulted primarily from volatility in revenues and gas volumes sold 
other income net other net reflects income of million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in compared to is primarily due to lower returns associated with investments that fund deferred compensation arrangements and lower interest income 
the increase in compared to relates primarily to increased afudc due to increased capital spending and higher interest income 
utility group interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense was million  a decrease of million compared to  as lower average short term debt levels and lower average short term interest rates were partially offset by higher long term balances and interest rates 
in  interest expense increased million compared to the increase is primarily driven by rising interest rates during the period and is also impacted by higher levels of short term borrowings 
the increase was mitigated somewhat by the full impact of financing transactions completed in october interest costs in reflect permanent financing transactions completed in the fourth quarter of in which million in debt related proceeds were received and used to retire short term borrowings and other long term debt 
utility group income taxes federal and state income taxes increased million in compared to and million in compared to the changes are impacted primarily by fluctuations in pre tax income and a lower effective tax rate in and environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  and local regulations with respect to environmental matters  principally air  solid waste  and water quality 
pursuant to environmental regulations  the company is required to obtain operating permits for the electric generating plants that it owns or operates and construction permits for any new plants it might propose to build 
regulations concerning air quality establish standards with respect to both ambient air quality and emissions from electric generating facilities  including particulate matter  sulfur dioxide so  nitrogen oxide nox  and mercury 
regulations concerning water quality establish standards relating to intake and discharge of water from electric generating facilities  including water used for cooling purposes in electric generating facilities 
because of the scope and complexity of these regulations  the company is unable to predict the ultimate effect of such regulations on its future operations 
clean air act initiatives in march of  the usepa finalized the clean air interstate rule cair 
cair is an allowance cap and trade program requiring further reductions from coal burning power plants in nox emissions beginning january  and so emissions beginning january   with a second phase of reductions in on july   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia vacated the federal cair regulations 
various parties filed motions for reconsideration  and on december   the court reinstated the cair regulations and remanded the regulations back to the usepa for promulgation of revisions in accordance with the court s july  order 
thus  the original version of cair promulgated in march of remains effective while usepa revises it per the court s guidance 
it is possible that a revised cair will require further reductions in nox and so from sigeco s generating units 
sigeco is in compliance with the current cair phase i annual nox reduction requirements in effect on january  utilization of the company s inventory of nox and so allowances may also be impacted if cair is further revised  however  most of the these allowances were granted to the company at zero cost  so a reduction in carrying value is not expected 

table of contents similarly  in march of  usepa promulgated the clean air mercury rule camr 
camr is an allowance cap and trade program requiring further reductions in mercury emissions from coal burning power plants 
the camr regulations were vacated by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit in july it is quite possible that the vacatur of the camr regulations will lead to increased support for the passage of a multi pollutant bill in congress 
it is also possible that the usepa will promulgate a revised mercury regulation in to comply with indiana s implementation plan of the clean air act of  the cair regulations  and to comply with potential future regulations of mercury and further nox and so reductions  sigeco has iurc authority to invest in clean coal technology 
using this authorization  sigeco has invested approximately million in pollution control equipment  including selective catalytic reduction scr systems and fabric filters 
scr technology is the most effective method of reducing nox emissions where high removal efficiencies are required and fabric filters control particulate matter emissions 
these investments were included in rate base for purposes of determining new base rates that went into effect on august  prior to being included in base rates  return on investments made and recovery of related operating expenses were recovered through a rider mechanism 
further  the iurc granted sigeco authority to invest in an so scrubber at its generating facility that is jointly owned with alcoa the company s portion is mw 
the order allows sigeco to recover an approximate percent return on capital investments through a rider mechanism which is periodically updated for actual costs incurred less post in service depreciation expense 
through december   the company has invested approximately million in this project 
the scrubber was placed into service on january   and the company expects the total project investment to approximate million once all post in service investments are completed 
recovery through a rider mechanism of associated operating expenses including depreciation expense associated with the scrubber also began on january  with the so scrubber fully operational  sigeco is positioned for compliance with the additional so reductions required by phase i cair commencing on january  sigeco s coal fired generating fleet is percent scrubbed for so and percent controlled for nox 
sigeco s investments in scrubber  scr and fabric filter technology allows for compliance with existing regulations and should position it to comply with future reasonable pollution control legislation  if and when  reductions in mercury and further reductions in nox and so are promulgated by usepa 
climate change vectren is committed to responsible environmental stewardship and conservation efforts as demonstrated by its proactive approach to balancing environmental and customer needs 
while scientific uncertainties exist and the debate surrounding global climate change is ongoing  the growing understanding of the science of climate change would suggest a strong potential for adverse economic and social consequences should world wide carbon dioxide co and other greenhouse gas emissions continue at present levels 
the need to reduce co and other greenhouse gas emissions  yet provide affordable energy requires thoughtful balance 
for these reasons  vectren supports a national climate change policy with the following elements an inclusive scope that involves all sectors of the economy and sources of greenhouse gases  and recognizes early actions and investments made to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions  provisions for enhanced use of renewable energy sources as a supplement to base load coal generation including effective energy conservation  demand side management and generation efficiency measures  a flexible market based cap and trade approach with zero cost allowance allocations to coal fired electric generators 
the approach should have a properly designed economic safety valve in order to reduce or eliminate extreme price spikes and potential price volatility 
a long lead time must be included to align nearer term technology capabilities and expanded generation efficiency and other enhanced renewable strategies  ensuring that generation sources will rely less on natural gas to meet short term carbon reduction requirements 
this new regime should allow for adequate resource and generation planning and remove existing impediments to efficiency enhancements posed by the current new source review provisions of the clean air act  inclusion of incentives for investment in advanced clean coal technology and support for research and development  and a strategy supporting alternative energy technologies and biofuels and increasing the domestic supply of natural gas to reduce dependence on foreign oil and imported natural gas 

table of contents current initiatives to increase conservation and reduce emissions the company is committed to its policy on climate change and conservation 
evidence of this commitment includes focusing the company s mission statement and purpose on corporate sustainability and the need to help customers conserve and manage energy costs  recently executing a year contract to purchase mw of wind energy generated by a wind farm in benton county  indiana  evaluating other renewable energy projects to complement base load coal fired generation in advance of mandated renewable energy portfolio standards  implementing conservation initiatives in the company s indiana and ohio gas utility service territories  participation in an electric conservation and demand side management collaborative with the oucc and other customer advocate groups  evaluating potential carbon requirements with regard to new generation  other fuel supply sources  and future environmental compliance plans  reducing the company s carbon footprint by measures such as purchasing hybrid vehicles  and optimizing generation efficiencies  developing renewable energy and energy efficiency performance contracting projects through its wholly owned subsidiary  energy systems group 
legislative actions and other climate change initiatives there are currently several forms of legislation being circulated at the federal level addressing the climate change issue 
these proposals generally involve either a cap and trade approach where there is a progressive cap on greenhouse gas emissions and an auctioning and subsequent trading of allowances among those that emit greenhouse gases or a carbon tax 
currently no legislation has passed either house of congress 
in the absence of federal legislation  several regional initiatives throughout the united states are in the process of establishing regional cap and trade programs 
while no climate change legislation is pending in the state of indiana  the state is an observer of the midwestern regional greenhouse gas reduction accord  and its legislature has in the recent past debated  but did not pass  renewable energy portfolio standards 
it is expected that the indiana state legislature will address a renewable energy portfolio standard again in in april of  the us supreme court determined that greenhouse gases meet the definition of air pollutant under the clean air act and ordered the usepa to determine whether greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare 
should the usepa find such endangerment  it is likely that major stationary sources will be subject to regulation under the act 
in  the usepa published its advanced notice of proposed rulemaking in which the agency solicited comment as to whether it is appropriate or effective to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the act 
the obama administration has asserted that it will act on the endangerment finding in the absence of comprehensive federal legislation within the next months 
impact of legislative actions and other initiatives is unknown if legislation requiring reductions in co and other greenhouse gases or legislation mandating a renewable energy portfolio standard is adopted  such regulation could substantially affect both the costs and operating characteristics of the company s fossil fuel generating plants  nonutility coal mining operations  and possibly natural gas distribution businesses 
further  any legislation would likely impact the company s generation resource planning decisions 
at this time and in the absence of final legislation  compliance costs and other effects associated with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions or obtaining renewable energy sources remain uncertain 
the company has gathered preliminary estimates of the costs to comply with a cap and trade approach to controlling greenhouse gas emissions 
a preliminary investigation demonstrated costs to comply would be significant  first to operating expenses for the purchase of allowances  and later to capital expenditures as technology becomes available to control greenhouse gas emissions 
however  these compliance cost estimates are very sensitive to highly uncertain assumptions  including allowance prices 
costs to purchase allowances that cap greenhouse gas emissions should be considered a cost of providing electricity  and as such  the company believes recovery should be timely reflected in rates charged to customers 
approximately percent of electric volumes sold in were delivered to municipal and other wholesale customers 
as such  the company has some flexibility to modify the level of these transactions to reduce overall emissions and reduce costs associated with complying with new environmental regulations 

table of contents environmental remediation efforts in the past  indiana gas  sigeco  and others operated facilities for the manufacture of gas 
given the availability of natural gas transported by pipelines  these facilities have not been operated for many years 
under currently applicable environmental laws and regulations  those that owned or operated these facilities may now be required to take remedial action if certain contaminants are found above the regulatory thresholds at these sites 
indiana gas identified the existence  location  and certain general characteristics of gas manufacturing and storage sites for which it may have some remedial responsibility 
indiana gas completed a remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs at one of the sites under an agreed order between indiana gas and the idem  and a record of decision was issued by the idem in january indiana gas submitted the remainder of the sites to the idem s voluntary remediation program vrp and is currently conducting some level of remedial activities  including groundwater monitoring at certain sites  where deemed appropriate  and will continue remedial activities at the sites as appropriate and necessary 
indiana gas accrued the estimated costs for further investigation  remediation  groundwater monitoring  and related costs for the sites 
while the total costs that may be incurred in connection with addressing these sites cannot be determined at this time  indiana gas has recorded cumulative costs that it reasonably expects to incur totaling approximately million 
the estimated accrued costs are limited to indiana gas share of the remediation efforts 
indiana gas has arrangements in place for of the sites with other potentially responsible parties prp  which serve to limit indiana gas share of response costs at these sites to between percent and percent 
with respect to insurance coverage  indiana gas has received and recorded settlements from all known insurance carriers under insurance policies in effect when these plants were in operation in an aggregate amount approximating million 
in october  sigeco received a formal information request letter from the idem regarding five manufactured gas plants that it owned and or operated and were not enrolled in the idem s vrp 
in october  sigeco filed applications to enter four of the manufactured gas plant sites in idem s vrp 
the remaining site is currently being addressed in the vrp by another indiana utility 
sigeco added those four sites into the renewal of the global voluntary remediation agreement that indiana gas has in place with idem for its manufactured gas plant sites 
that renewal was approved by the idem in february sigeco is also named in a lawsuit filed in federal district court in may  involving another site subject to potential environmental remediation efforts 
sigeco has filed a declaratory judgment action against its insurance carriers seeking a judgment finding its carriers liable under the policies for coverage of further investigation and any necessary remediation costs that sigeco may accrue under the vrp program and or related to the site subject to the may lawsuit 
while the total costs that may be incurred in connection with addressing these sites cannot be determined at this time  sigeco has recorded cumulative costs that it reasonably expects to incur totaling approximately million 
with respect to insurance coverage  sigeco has received and recorded settlements from insurance carriers under insurance policies in effect when these sites were in operation in an aggregate amount of million 

table of contents environmental remediation costs related to indiana gas and sigeco s manufactured gas plants and other sites have had a minor impact on results of operations or financial condition since cumulative costs recorded to date approximate prp and insurance settlement recoveries 
such cumulative costs are estimated by management using assumptions based on actual costs incurred  the timing of expected future payments  and inflation factors  among others 
while the company s utilities have recorded all costs which they presently expect to incur in connection with activities at these sites  it is possible that future events may require some level of additional remedial activities which are not presently foreseen and those costs may not be subject to prp or insurance recovery 
as of december   approximately million is included in other liabilities related to the remediation of these sites 
jacobsville superfund site on july   the usepa listed the jacobsville neighborhood soil contamination site in evansville  indiana  on the national priorities list under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
the usepa has identified four sources of historic lead contamination 
these four sources shut down manufacturing operations years ago 
when drawing up the boundaries for the listing  the usepa included a acre block of properties surrounding the jacobsville neighborhood  including vectren s wagner operations center 
vectren s property has not been named as a source of the lead contamination  nor does the usepa s soil testing to date indicate that the vectren property contains lead contaminated soils 
vectren s own soil testing  completed during the construction of the operations center  did not indicate that the vectren property contains lead contaminated soils 
at this time  vectren anticipates only additional soil testing could be requested by the usepa at some future date 
rate and regulatory matters gas and electric operations with regard to retail rates and charges  terms of service  accounting matters  issuance of securities  and certain other operational matters specific to its indiana customers are regulated by the iurc 
the retail gas operations of the ohio operations are subject to regulation by the puco 
gas rates in indiana contain a gas cost adjustment gca clause 
the gca clause allows the company to charge for changes in the cost of purchased gas 
electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause fac that allows for adjustment in charges for electric energy to reflect changes in the cost of fuel 
the net energy cost of purchased power  subject to a variable benchmark based on nymex natural gas prices  is also recovered through regulatory proceedings 
the iurc approved agreement authorizing this recovery expires in april  and is subject to automatic annual renewals 
gca and fac procedures involve periodic filings and iurc hearings to establish the amount of price adjustments for a designated future period 
the procedures also provide for inclusion in later periods of any variances between the estimated cost of gas  cost of fuel  and net energy cost of purchased power and actual costs incurred 
the company records any under or over recovery resulting from gas and fuel adjustment clauses each month in margin 
a corresponding asset or liability is recorded until the under or over recovery is billed or refunded to utility customers 
the iurc has also applied the statute authorizing gca and fac procedures to reduce rates when necessary to limit net operating income to a level authorized in its last general rate order through the application of an earnings test 
these earnings tests have not had any material impact to the company s recent operating results 
prior to october   gas costs were recovered in ohio through a gas cost recovery gcr clause 
the gcr clause operated similar to the gca clause in indiana 
the puco periodically audited the gcr rates 
the period from november to september  the final gcr period subject to audit  is currently under audit by the puco 
after october st  the company is no longer the supplier  and the gcr is no longer necessary 
vectren energy delivery ohio  inc vedo gas base rate order received on january   the puco issued an order approving the stipulation reached in the vedo rate case 
the order provides for a rate increase of nearly million  an overall rate of return of percent on rate base of about million  an opportunity to recover costs of a program to accelerate replacement of cast iron and bare steel pipes  as well as certain service risers  and base rate recovery of an additional million in conservation program spending 

table of contents the order also adjusts the rate design that will be used to collect the agreed upon revenue from vedo s residential customers 
the order authorizes the use of a straight fixed variable rate design which places all  or most  of the fixed cost recovery in the customer service charge 
using a phased in approach  revenues based on volumes sold will be entirely replaced with a fixed charge after one year 
a straight fixed variable design mitigates some weather risk as well as the effects of declining usage  similar to the company s lost margin recovery mechanism  which expired when this new rate design went into effect in february in  results include approximately million of revenue from the existing lost margin recovery mechanism that will not continue once this base rate increase is in effect 
the occ has filed a request for rehearing on the rate design finding by the puco 
the rehearing request mirrors similar requests filed by the occ in each case where the puco has approved similar rate designs  and all such requests have been denied

vectren energy delivery ohio  inc begins process to exit the merchant function on august   the puco approved an auction selecting qualified wholesale suppliers to provide the gas commodity to the company for resale to its customers at auction determined standard pricing 
this standard pricing is comprised of the monthly nymex settlement price plus a fixed adder 
this auction  which is effective from october  through march   is the initial step in exiting the merchant function in the company s ohio service territory 
the approach eliminates the need for monthly gas cost recovery gcr filings and prospective puco gcr audits 
on october st  vedo s entire natural gas inventory was transferred  receiving proceeds of approximately million 
the puco has also provided for an exit transition cost rider  which allows the company to recover costs associated with the transition 
as the cost of gas is currently passed through to customers through a puco approved recovery mechanism  the impact of exiting the merchant function should not have a material impact on company earnings or financial condition

miso since february and with the iurc s approval  the company has been a member of the midwest independent system operator  inc miso  a ferc approved regional transmission organization 
the miso serves the electrical transmission needs of much of the midwest and maintains operational control over the company s electric transmission facilities as well as that of other midwest utilities 
since april   the company has been an active participant in the miso energy markets  bidding its owned generation into the day ahead and real time markets and procuring power for its retail customers at locational marginal pricing lmp as determined by the miso market 
the company is typically in a net sales position with miso as generation capacity is in excess of that needed to serve native load and is only occasionally in a net purchase position 
when the company is a net seller such net revenues are included in electric utility revenues and when the company is a net purchaser such net purchases are included in cost of fuel and purchased power 
net positions are determined on an hourly basis 
since the company became an active miso member  its generation optimization strategies primarily involve the sale of excess generation into the miso day ahead and real time markets 
net revenues from wholesale activities included in electric utility revenues totaled million in  million in and million in the company also receives transmission revenue that results from other members use of the company s transmission system 
these revenues are also included in electric utility revenues 
generally  these transmission revenues along with costs charged by the miso are considered components of base rates and any variance from that included in base rates is recovered refunded through tracking mechanisms 
as a result of miso s operational control over much of the midwestern electric transmission grid  including sigeco s transmission facilities  sigeco s continued ability to import power  when necessary  and export power to the wholesale market has been  and may continue to be  impacted 
given the nature of miso s policies regarding use of transmission facilities  as well as ongoing ferc initiatives  and a day ancillary services market asm  where miso began providing a bid based regulation and contingency operating reserve markets on january   it is difficult to predict near term operational impacts 
the iurc has approved the company s participation in the asm and has granted authority to defer costs associated with asm 

table of contents the need to expend capital for improvements to the regional transmission system  both to sigeco s facilities as well as to those facilities of adjacent utilities  over the next several years is expected to be significant 
the company timely recovers its investment in certain new electric transmission projects that benefit the miso infrastructure at a ferc approved rate of return 
one such project is an interstate kilovolt transmission line that will connect vectren s a b brown station to a station in indiana owned by duke energy to the north and to a station in kentucky owned by big rivers electric corporation to the south 
throughout the project  sigeco is to recover an approximate percent return  inclusive of the ferc approved equity rate of return of percent  on capital investments through a rider mechanism which is periodically updated for actual costs incurred 
of the total investment  which is expected to approximate million  as of december   the company has invested approximately million 
the company expects this project to be operational in at that time  any operating expenses including depreciation expense are also expected to be recovered through a ferc approved rider mechanism 
further  the approval allows for recovery of expenditures made even in the event currently unforeseen difficulties delay or permanently halt the project

energy marketing and services markets and supplies natural gas and provides energy management services 
coal mining mines and sells coal 
energy infrastructure services provides underground construction and repair and provides performance contracting and renewable energy services 
there are also other legacy businesses that have invested in energy related opportunities and services  real estate  and leveraged leases  among other investments

economic declines may be accompanied by a decrease in demand for products and services offered by nonutility operations and therefore lower revenues for those products and services 
the recent economic downturn may have some negative impact on utility industry spending for construction projects  demand for coal  and spending on performance contracting and renewable energy expansion 
it is also possible that a prolonged recession could result in further reductions in the value of certain nonutility real estate and other legacy investments

liberty holds a long term lease of storage and mineral rights associated with existing salt dome storage caverns in southern louisiana  near sulphur  louisiana 
liberty also owns a second site near hackberry  louisiana with three additional existing salt dome storage caverns 
the members anticipated it would provide high deliverability storage services via the salt dome caverns at both locations and  once developed under current plans  there would be approximately billion cubic feet of working gas capacity at the two sites 
proliance has a long term contract for approximately bcf of working gas capacity 
the total project investment at the sulphur site through december  is approximately million 
proliance s portion of the investment is estimated at approximately million

coal mining  inclusive of holding company costs  operated at a loss of million in  compared to earnings of million in and million in the decrease in earnings in compared to was primarily due to lower production and increased roofing structure costs as a result of revised regulatory guidelines from the mine safety and health administration msha which necessitated changes to the mining plan 
as a result  the yield at the prosperity mine decreased to percent in down from percent in and in addition  has been impacted by higher diesel fuel costs and unfavorable geologic conditions at the company s surface mine  which has resulted in more costs to enhance the btu content of mined coal 
the decline in earnings in compared to was primarily due to the effects of compliance with revised msha seal guidelines and higher sulfur content from coal mined under a revised mining plan

table of contents critical accounting policies management is required to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the consolidated financial statement footnotes describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain estimates used in the financial statements are subjective and use variables that require judgment 
these include the estimates to perform goodwill and other asset impairments tests and to determine pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
the company makes other estimates  in the course of accounting for unbilled revenue and the effects of regulation that are critical to the company s financial results but that are less likely to be impacted by near term changes 
other estimates that significantly affect the company s results  but are not necessarily critical to operations  include depreciating utility and nonutility plant  valuing reclamation liabilities  valuing derivative contracts  and estimating uncollectible accounts and coal reserves  among others 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
impairment review of investments the company has both debt and equity investments in unconsolidated entities 
when events occur that may cause one of these investments to be impaired  the company performs both a qualitative and quantitative review of that investment and when necessary performs an impairment analysis 
an impairment analysis of notes receivable usually involves the comparison of the investment s estimated free cash flows to the stated terms of the note  or for notes that are collateral dependent  a comparison of the collateral s fair value  if readily available  to the carrying amount of the note 
an impairment analysis of equity investments involves comparison of the investment s estimated fair value to its carrying amount 
fair value is estimated using market comparisons  appraisals  and or discounted cash flow analyses 
calculating free cash flows and fair value using the above methods is subjective and requires judgment concerning growth assumptions  longevity of cash flows  and discount rates for fair value calculations 
the current economic recession has impacted the value of commercial real estate investments within the other businesses nonutility portfolio  and the prospect for recovery of that value has diminished 
the company assessed its commercial real estate investments for impairment and identified the need to reduce their carrying values 
the impairment charge recorded in totaled million 
the assessment was conducted using sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  apb the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  and sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and their related amendments and interpretations 
an impairment analysis of notes receivable per sfas involves the comparison of the investment s estimated free cash flows to the stated terms of the note 
an impairment analysis of equity method investments per apb is a comparison of the investment s estimated fair value to its carrying amount and an assessment of whether any decline in fair value is other than temporary 
fair value was estimated primarily using discounted future cash flows 
calculating free cash flows and the resulting fair value is subjective and requires judgment concerning growth assumptions  longevity of cash flows  and discount rates 
significant assumptions impacting these analyses were holding periods  net operating income and capitalization rates  which have increased in the current economic and credit constrained environment 
related to capitalization rates  the company used a cap rate to value a suburban chicago commercial real estate holding owned by the company that is currently vacant and a cap rate to value leased commercial real estate located in charlotte  nc and birmingham  al that serve as collateral for a note receivable 
a basis point increase in those cap rates would have increased the impairment charge by million 
actual realized values could differ from these estimates 
in and  the company examined the recoverability of a note receivable from the city of alameda california  and determined the carrying value of that investment is not impaired 
this was primarily a qualitative assessment of collecting amounts due pursuant to the note agreement s contract provisions 
based on that review  the company believes collection is probable 
however  actual amounts realized could differ from recorded amounts 

table of contents in  the company fully impaired its investment in pace carbon 
the company took this action because of the effect high oil prices had on pace carbon s future operations 
the write off of the investment and expensing of future funding requirements totaled million  or million after tax in goodwill and intangible assets the company performs an annual impairment analysis of its goodwill  most of which resides in the gas utility services operating segment  at the beginning of each year  and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level 
the company has determined its gas utility services operating segment as identified in note to the consolidated financial statements to be the reporting unit 
nonutility group reporting units are generally defined as the operating companies that aggregate that operating segment 
an impairment test requires that a reporting unit s fair value be estimated 
the company used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its gas utility services operating segment  and that estimated fair value was compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value was in excess of the carrying amount in   and and therefore resulted in no impairment 
goodwill related to the nonutility group is also tested using market comparable data  if readily available  or a discounted cash flow model 
estimating fair value using a discounted cash flow model is subjective and requires significant judgment in applying a discount rate  growth assumptions  company expense allocations  and longevity of cash flows 
a basis point increase in the discount rate utilized to calculate the gas utility services segment s fair value also would have resulted in no impairment charge 
the company also annually tests non amortizing intangible assets for impairment and amortizing intangible assets are tested on an event and circumstance basis 
during   and  these tests yielded no impairment charges 
pension and other postretirement obligations the company estimates the expected return on plan assets  discount rate  rate of compensation increase  and future health care costs  among other inputs  and relies on actuarial estimates to assess the future potential liability and funding requirements of the company s pension and postretirement plans 
the company has historically measured its obligations annually on september however  in  the company measured these obligations on december in accordance with sfas the company used the following weighted average assumptions to develop periodic benefit cost a discount rate of percent  an expected return on plan assets of percent  a rate of compensation increase of percent  and an inflation assumption of percent 
in  the company increased the discount rate from percent  which was used to measure periodic cost due to an increase in benchmark interest rates 
due to the recent and significant decline in asset values  retirement plan costs are expected to be higher in and in subsequent years 
management currently estimates a pension and postretirement cost of approximately to million in depending on funding levels  compared to approximately million in future changes in health care costs  work force demographics  interest rates  asset values or plan changes could significantly affect the estimated cost of these future benefits 
management estimates that a basis point decrease in the discount rate used to estimate projected costs would generally increase periodic benefit cost by approximately million 
unbilled revenues to more closely match revenues and expenses  the company records revenues for all gas and electricity delivered to customers but not billed at the end of the accounting period 
the company uses actual units billed during the month to allocate unbilled units by customer class 
those allocated units are multiplied by rates in effect during the month to calculate unbilled revenue at balance sheet dates

based on the company s current review  it believes its regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
if all or part of the company s operations cease to meet the criteria of sfas  a write off of related regulatory assets and liabilities could be required 
in addition  the company would be required to determine any impairment to the carrying value of its utility plant and other regulated assets and liabilities 
in the unlikely event of a change in the current regulatory environment  such write offs and impairment charges could be significant 
financial condition within vectren s consolidated group  utility holdings funds the short term and long term financing needs of the utility group operations  and vectren capital corp vectren capital funds short term and long term financing needs of the nonutility group and corporate operations 
vectren corporation guarantees vectren capital s debt  but does not guarantee utility holdings debt 
vectren capital s long term and short term obligations outstanding at december  approximated million and million  respectively 
utility holdings outstanding long term and short term borrowing arrangements are jointly and severally guaranteed by indiana gas  sigeco  and vedo 
utility holdings long term and short term obligations outstanding at december  approximated million and million  respectively 
additionally  prior to utility holdings formation  indiana gas and sigeco funded their operations separately  and therefore  have long term debt outstanding funded solely by their operations 
the company s common stock dividends are primarily funded by utility operations 
nonutility operations have demonstrated profitability and the ability to generate cash flows 
these cash flows are primarily reinvested in other nonutility ventures  but are also used to fund a portion of the company s dividends  and from time to time may be reinvested in utility operations or used for corporate expenses 
the credit ratings of the senior unsecured debt of utility holdings and indiana gas  at december   are a baa as rated by standard and poor s ratings services standard and poor s and moody s investors service moody s  respectively 
the credit ratings on sigeco s secured debt are a a utility holdings commercial paper has a credit rating of a p the current outlook of both moody s and standard and poor s is stable 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell  or hold securities 
the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
standard and poor s and moody s lowest level investment grade rating is bbb and baa  respectively 
the company s consolidated equity capitalization objective is percent of long term capitalization 
this objective may have varied  and will vary  depending on particular business opportunities  capital spending requirements  execution of long term financing plans and seasonal factors that affect the company s operations 
the company s equity component was percent of long term capitalization at both december   and long term capitalization includes long term debt  including current maturities and debt subject to tender  as well as common shareholders equity 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all financial covenants 
available liquidity in current credit conditions as noted below  in the company completed permanent financing transactions  including the issuance of million in long term debt  million in common stock  and an expansion of million in the level of short term borrowing capacity for its nonutility operations 
these transactions have increased the level of unutilized short term borrowing capacity 
this unutilized short term debt capacity  when coupled with expected internally generated funds and any additional long term financings undertaken  should provide sufficient liquidity over the next twelve to twenty four months to fund anticipated capital expenditures  investments  and debt security redemptions 

table of contents regarding debt redemptions  they are insignificant in  and million is due in in addition  holders of certain debt instruments have the one time option to put them to the company 
debt subject to these put provisions total million in and million in the company continues to develop plans to issue additional long term debt over the next twelve to twenty four months  assuming its a baa investment grade credit ratings will allow it to access the capital markets  as the need arises 
however  while debt markets have improved somewhat  such long term debt issued during this period could be more expensive than in recent history 
this permanent financing would reduce reliance on unutilized short term capacity 
consolidated short term borrowing arrangements at december   the company had million of short term borrowing capacity  including million for the utility group and million for the wholly owned nonutility group and corporate operations  of which approximately million was available for the utility group operations and approximately million was available for the wholly owned nonutility group and corporate operations  as reduced for approximately million in outstanding letters of credit 
of the million in utility group capacity  million is available through november   and of the million in nonutility capacity  million is available through september  and million is available through november  historically  the company has funded the short term borrowing needs of utility holdings operations through the commercial paper market 
in  the company s access to longer term commercial paper was significantly reduced as a result of the continued turmoil and volatility in the financial markets 
as a result  the company has met working capital requirements through a combination of a p commercial paper issuances and draws on utility holdings million commercial paper back up credit facilities 
in addition  the company increased its cash investments by approximately million during the fourth quarter of these cash positions were liquidated in january based upon improvements in the short term debt and commercial paper markets 
their liquidation resulted in an increase to the available short term debt capacity for the utility group by million and for the nonutility group by million 
proliance short term borrowing arrangements proliance  a nonutility energy marketing affiliate of vectren and citizens  has its own short term borrowing capacity available through a syndicated credit facility 
the terms of the facility allow for million of capacity from april through september  and million during the october through march heating season 
at december   approximately million was outstanding 
this remaining unutilized capacity  when coupled with internally generated funds  is expected to provide sufficient liquidity to meet proliance s operational needs 
the facility expires june  at which time  proliance anticipates having a new credit facility in place to support its future working capital requirements 
future working capital requirements may be less than the level of the current credit line given the recent decline in natural gas prices 
the current facility is not guaranteed by vectren or citizens 
new share issues the company may periodically issue new common shares to satisfy the dividend reinvestment plan  stock option plan and other employee benefit plan requirements 
new issuances added additional liquidity of million in and million in in  new issuances required to meet these various plan requirements are estimated to be approximately million 

table of contents potential uses of liquidity pension and postretirement funding obligations the company s consolidated financial statements as of december  reported pension plan asset values of approximately million  compared to asset values as of december  of approximately million  and since december   market values have remained volatile and have experienced further declines 
asset values for qualified plans as of december  are approximately percent of the projected benefit obligation 
management currently estimates that the qualified pension plans may require company contributions of approximately to million in and a lesser level in during  approximately million in contributions were made 
other guarantees and letters of credit in the normal course of business  vectren issues guarantees to third parties on behalf of its unconsolidated affiliates 
such guarantees allow those affiliates to execute transactions on more favorable terms than the affiliate could obtain without such a guarantee 
guarantees may include posted letters of credit  leasing guarantees  and performance guarantees 
as of december   guarantees issued and outstanding on behalf of unconsolidated affiliates approximated million 
the company has accrued no liabilities for these guarantees as they relate to guarantees executed prior to the adoption of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
planned capital expenditures investments planned capital expenditures and investments in nonutility unconsolidated affiliates  including contractual purchase and investment commitments discussed below  for the five year period are estimated as follows in millions utility group nonutility group total capital expenditures investments contractual obligations the following is a summary of contractual obligations at december  in millions total thereafter long term debt short term debt long term debt interest commitments nonutility commodity purchase commitments plant purchase commitments operating leases total certain long term debt issues contain put and call provisions that can be exercised on various dates before maturity 
these provisions allow holders the one time option to put debt back to the company at face value or the company to call debt at face value or at a premium 
long term debt subject to tender during the years following in millions is in  in  in  zero in and thereafter 
the settlement period of these utility and nonutility plant obligations is estimated 
the company has other long term liabilities that total approximately million 
this amount is comprised of the following pension obligations million  postretirement obligations million  deferred compensation and share based compensation million  asset retirement obligations million  investment tax credits million  environmental remediation million  and other obligations including unrecognized tax benefits totaling million 
based on the nature of these items their expected settlement dates cannot be estimated 

table of contents the company s regulated utilities have both firm and non firm commitments to purchase natural gas and electricity as well as certain transportation and storage rights 
costs arising from these commitments  while significant  are pass through costs  generally collected dollar for dollar from retail customers through regulator approved cost recovery mechanisms 
because of the pass through nature of these costs and their insignificant impact to earnings  they have not been included in the listing of contractual obligations 
comparison of historical sources uses of liquidity operating cash flow the company s primary source of liquidity to fund working capital requirements has been cash generated from operations  which totaled million in  compared to million in and million in in cash flow from operating activities increased million compared to higher levels of deferred taxes due primarily to federal stimulus plans authorizing bonus depreciation on qualifying capital expenditures increased cash flow approximately million 
working capital changes generated cash of million in compared to cash used of million in the increase in cash from working capital results primarily from the permanent reduction of natural gas inventory associated with vedo s exit of the merchant function  offset by growth in recoverable fuel balances 
the remaining increase in operating cash flow is primarily due to the cash collection of previously deferred regulatory assets 
while net income increased substantially in compared to  cash flow from operating activities decreased million 
the decrease was primarily a result of changes in working capital accounts and lower distributions from equity method investments compared to the prior year 
working capital changes used cash of million in compared to cash generated of million in distributions from equity method investments  which principally consist of dividends from proliance  decreased approximately million due to primarily to a million special dividend from proliance in in the company also increased its pension contributions  which resulted in a decrease to operating cash flow  compared to these decreases were partially offset by the higher earnings in as well as increased deferred taxes 
financing cash flow although working capital requirements are generally funded by cash flow from operations  the company uses short term borrowings to supplement working capital needs when accounts receivable balances are at their highest and gas storage is refilled 
additionally  short term borrowings are required for capital projects and investments until they are financed on a long term basis 
net cash flow generated from financing activities were million in the increased cash generated from financing activities during compared to is reflective of the impact of completed long term financing transactions  including the issuance of common stock and long term debt 
in compared to  financing activities reflect short term and long term debt proceeds and stock option proceeds offset by debt payments and dividends 
in  vectren settled an equity forward contract receiving proceeds of approximately million  and utility holdings issued million of senior unsecured securities and used those proceeds to refinance certain capital projects originally financed with short term borrowings

table of contents vectren common stock issuance in february  the company sold million authorized but previously unissued shares of its common stock to a group of underwriters in an sec registered primary offering at a price of per share 
the transaction generated proceeds  net of underwriting discounts and commissions  of approximately million 
the company executed an equity forward sale agreement equity forward in connection with the offering  and therefore  did not receive proceeds at the time of the equity offering 
the equity forward allowed the company to price an offering under market conditions existing at that time  and to better match the receipt of the offering proceeds and the associated share dilution with the implementation of regulatory initiatives 
on june   the company physically settled the equity forward by delivering the million shares  receiving proceeds of approximately million 
the slight difference between the proceeds generated by the public offering and those received by the company were due to adjustments defined in the equity forward agreement including daily increases in the forward sale price based on a floating interest factor equal to the federal funds rate  less a basis point fixed spread  and structured quarterly decreases to the forward sale price that align with expected company dividend payments

table of contents the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of changes in actual results  changes in assumptions  or other factors affecting such statements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various business risks associated with commodity prices  interest rates  and counter party credit 
these financial exposures are monitored and managed by the company as an integral part of its overall risk management program 
the company s risk management program includes  among other things  the use of derivatives 
the company may also execute derivative contracts in the normal course of operations while buying and selling commodities to be used in operations and optimizing its generation assets 
the company has in place a risk management committee that consists of senior management as well as financial and operational management 
the committee is actively involved in identifying risks as well as reviewing and authorizing risk mitigation strategies 
commodity price risk regulated operations the company s regulated operations have limited exposure to commodity price risk for transactions involving purchases and sales of natural gas  coal and purchased power for the benefit of retail customers due to current indiana and ohio regulations  which subject to compliance with those regulations  allow for recovery of the cost of such purchases through natural gas and fuel cost adjustment mechanisms 
constructive regulatory orders  such as those authorizing lost margin recovery  other innovative rate designs  and recovery of unaccounted for gas and other gas related expenses  also mitigate the effect volatile gas costs may have on the company s financial condition 
although vectren s regulated operations are exposed to limited commodity price risk  volatile natural gas prices have other effects such as higher working capital requirements  higher interest costs  and some level of price sensitivity in volumes sold or delivered 
the company manages these risks by executing derivative contracts that hedge the price of forecasted natural gas purchases 
these contracts are subject to regulation which allows for reasonable and prudent hedging costs to be recovered through rates 
therefore  sfas controls when the offset to mark to market accounting is recognized in earnings 
wholesale power marketing the company s wholesale power marketing activities undertake strategies to optimize electric generating capacity beyond that needed for native load 
in recent years  the primary strategy involves the sale of excess generation into the miso day ahead and real time markets 
as part of these strategies  the company may also from time to time execute energy contracts that commit the company to purchase and sell electricity in the future 
commodity price risk results from forward positions that commit the company to deliver electricity 
the company mitigates price risk exposure with planned unutilized generation capability and occasionally offsetting forward purchase contracts 
the company accounts for any energy contracts that are derivatives at fair value with the offset marked to market through earnings 
no market sensitive derivative positions were outstanding on december  and 
table of contents for retail sales of electricity  the company receives the majority of its nox and so allowances at zero cost through an allocation process 
based on arrangements with regulators  wholesale operations can purchase allowances from retail operations at current market values  the value of which is distributed back to retail customers through a miso cost recovery tracking mechanism 
wholesale operations are therefore at risk for the cost of allowances  which for the recent past have been volatile 
the company manages this risk by purchasing allowances from retail operations and other third parties in advance of usage creating an intangible asset 
in the past  the company has also used derivative financial instruments to hedge this risk  but no such derivative instruments were outstanding at december  or other operations other commodity related operations are exposed to commodity price risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices including natural gas and coal 
other commodity related operations include nonutility retail gas marketing  and coal mining operations 
open positions in terms of price  volume  and specified delivery points may occur and are managed using methods described below with frequent management reporting 
the company purchases and sells commodities  including electricity  natural gas  and coal to meet customer demands and operational needs 
the company executes forward contracts and occasionally option contracts that commit the company to purchase and sell commodities in the future 
price risk from forward positions obligating the company to deliver commodities is mitigated using stored inventory  generating capability  and offsetting forward purchase contracts 
price risk also results from forward contracts obligating the company to purchase commodities to fulfill forecasted nonregulated sales of natural gas and coal that may or may not occur 
with the exception of a small portion of contracts that are derivatives that qualify as hedges of forecasted transactions under sfas  these contracts are expected to be settled by physical receipt or delivery of the commodity 
unconsolidated affiliate proliance  a nonregulated energy marketing affiliate  engages in energy hedging activities to manage pricing decisions  minimize the risk of price volatility  and minimize price risk exposure in the energy markets 
proliance s market exposure arises from storage inventory  imbalances  and fixed price forward purchase and sale contracts  which are entered into to support its operating activities 
currently  proliance buys and sells physical commodities and utilizes financial instruments to hedge its market exposure 
however  net open positions in terms of price  volume and specified delivery point do occur 
proliance manages open positions with policies which limit its exposure to market risk and require reporting potential financial exposure to its management and its members 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its borrowing arrangements 
its risk management program seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market volatility may have on interest expense 
the company manages this risk by allowing an annual average of percent and percent of its total debt to be exposed to variable rate volatility 
however  this targeted range may be exceeded during the seasonal increases in short term borrowing 
to manage this exposure  the company may use derivative financial instruments 
market risk is estimated as the potential impact resulting from fluctuations in interest rates on adjustable rate borrowing arrangements exposed to short term interest rate volatility 
during and  the weighted average combined borrowings under these arrangements approximated million and million  respectively 
at december  and  combined borrowings under these arrangements were million and million  respectively 
based upon average borrowing rates under these facilities during the years ended december  and  an increase of basis points one percentage point in the rates would have increased interest expense by million and million  respectively 
other risks by using financial instruments to manage risk  the company  as well as proliance  exposes itself to counter party credit risk and market risk 
the company manages exposure to counter party credit risk by entering into contracts with companies that can be reasonably expected to fully perform under the terms of the contract 
counter party credit risk is monitored regularly and positions are adjusted appropriately to manage risk 
further  tools such as netting arrangements and requests for collateral are also used to manage credit risk 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in commodity prices or interest rates 
the company attempts to manage exposure to market risk associated with commodity contracts and interest rates by establishing parameters and monitoring those parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken 

table of contents the company s customer receivables from gas and electric sales and gas transportation services are primarily derived from residential  commercial  and industrial customers located in indiana and west central ohio 
the company manages credit risk associated with its receivables by continually reviewing creditworthiness and requests cash deposits or refunds cash deposits based on that review 
credit risk associated with certain investments is also managed by a review of creditworthiness and receipt of collateral 
in addition  credit risk is mitigated by regulatory orders that allow recovery of all bad debt expense in ohio and the gas cost portion of bad debt expense in indiana based on historical experience
