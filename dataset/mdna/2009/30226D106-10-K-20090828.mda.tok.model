table of contents resellers 
we rely on many resellers worldwide that sell directly to end user customer 
our resellers include regional networking system resellers  resellers who focus on specific vertical markets  value added resellers  network integrators and wholesale resellers 
we provide training and support to our resellers and our resellers generally provide the first level of contact to end users of our products 
our relationships with resellers are generally on a non exclusive basis 
our resellers are not given rights to return inventory and do not automatically participate in any cooperative marketing programs 
we generally recognize product revenue from our reseller and end user customers at the time of shipment  provided other revenue recognition criteria are met 
when significant obligations or contingencies remain after products are delivered  such as installation or customer acceptance  revenue and related costs are deferred until such obligations or contingencies are satisfied 
see revenue recognition in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
field sales 
we have trained our field sales organization to support and develop leads for our resellers and to establish and maintain key accounts and strategic end user customers 
to support these objectives  our field sales force assists end user customers in finding solutions to complex network system and architecture problems  differentiates the features and capabilities of our products from competitive offerings  continually monitors and understands the evolving networking needs of enterprise and service provider customers  promotes our products and ensures direct contact with current and potential customers  assists our resellers to drive to closure business opportunities  and monitors the changing requirements of our customers 
as of june   our worldwide sales and marketing organization consisted of individuals  including directors  managers  sales representatives  and technical and administrative support personnel 
we have domestic sales offices located in states and international sales offices located in countries 
international sales international sales are an important portion of our business 
in fiscal  sales to customers outside of north america accounted for of our consolidated net revenue  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal these sales are conducted primarily through foreign based distributors and resellers managed by our worldwide sales organization 
in addition  we have direct sales to end user customers  including large global accounts 
the primary markets for sales outside of north america are countries in europe and asia

our marketing efforts include participation in industry tradeshows  technical conferences and technology seminars  preparation of competitive analyses  sales training  and publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals  a publicly available website  promotions  web based training courses  advertising and public relations 
we also submit our products for independent product testing and evaluation 

table of contents backlog our products are often sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancelable prior to shipment without significant penalties 
in addition  purchase orders are subject to changes in quantities of products and delivery schedules in order to reflect changes in customer requirements and manufacturing capacity 
our business is characterized by seasonal variability in demand and short lead time orders and delivery schedules 
actual shipments depend on the then current capacity of our contract manufacturers and the availability of materials and components from our vendors 
we believe that only a small portion of our order backlog is non cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non cancelable portion is not material 
accordingly  we do not believe that backlog at any given time is a meaningful indicator of future revenue 
seasonality like many of our competitors  we historically have experienced seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns  which generally adversely affect our first and third fiscal quarters 
this pattern should not be relied upon  however  as it has varied in the past 
customer service and support our customers all seek high reliability and maximum uptime for their networks 
to that extent  we provide the following service offerings support services for end users  resellers and distributors

sen s manufacturing processes and procedures are iso certified 
sen has made ongoing supply and support commitments during the term of the agreement and is required to provide support for a defined period of time after any termination of the agreement 
these manufacturers utilize automated testing equipment to perform product testing and burn in with specified tests 
together we rely upon comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls to assure the quality and reliability of our products 
we use our forecast of expected demand to determine our material requirements 
lead times for materials and components vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
we order most of our materials and components on an indirect basis through our contract manufacturer 
purchase commitments with our manufacturers are generally on a purchase order basis 
research and development the success of our products to date is due in large part to our focus on research and development 
we believe that continued success in the marketplace will depend on our ability to develop new and enhanced products employing leading edge technology 
accordingly  we are undertaking development efforts with an emphasis on increasing the reliability  performance and features of our family of products  and designing innovative products to reduce the overall network operating costs of customers

research and development efforts are conducted in several locations  including santa clara  california  raleigh  north carolina  and chennai  india 
our research and development expenses in fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents competition the market for network switches  which is part of the broader market for networking equipment  is extremely competitive and characterized by rapid technological progress  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
we believe the principal competitive factors in the network switching market are expertise and familiarity with network protocols  network switching and network management  product performance  features  functionality and reliability  price performance characteristics  timeliness of new product introductions  adoption of emerging industry standards  customer service and support  size and scope of distribution network  brand name  breadth of product offering  access to customers  and size of installed customer base 
we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors with respect to many of the foregoing factors 
however  the market for network switching solutions is dominated by a few large companies  particularly cisco systems  inc in addition to cisco systems  we compete with public and private companies that offer switching solutions or provide alternative networking solutions  including com corporation  alcatel lucent  brocade communications systems  inc  hewlett packard company  huawei technologies corporation  juniper networks  inc and sen 
most of these competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  broader product lines and substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
based on our commitment to build a patent portfolio  we have in process a number of patent applications relating to our proprietary technology in the united states and in selected other countries 
with respect to trademarks  we have a number of pending and registered trademarks in the united states and abroad 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to  and distribution of  our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
in addition  we provide our software products to end user customers primarily under shrink wrap license agreements 
these agreements are not negotiated with or signed by the licensee  and thus these agreements may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
environment we maintain compliance with various regulations related to the environment  including the waste electrical and electronic equipment and restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and 
table of contents electronic equipment regulations adopted by the european union 
further  we are committed to energy efficiency in our product lines 
for example  certain of our products consume far less power than offerings from our major competitors 
accordingly  we believe this is an area that affords us a competitive advantage for our products in the marketplace 
to date  our compliance efforts with various us and foreign regulations related to the environment has not had a material effect on our operating results 
employees as of june   we employed people  including in sales and marketing  in research and development  in operations  in customer support and service  and in finance and administration 
we have never had a work stoppage and no personnel are represented under collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
we believe that our future success depends on our continued ability to attract  integrate  retain  train and motivate highly qualified personnel  and upon the continued service of our senior management and key personnel 
none of our executive officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement which mandates that the employee render services for any specific term 
the market for qualified personnel is competitive  particularly in the san francisco bay area  where our headquarters is located

item a 
risk factors the following is a list of risks and uncertainties which may have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the risks and uncertainties set out below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face  and some are endemic to the networking industry 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future because a number of factors could negatively affect our financial results 
although we reported profits for fiscal  we have reported losses in some of our prior fiscal years 
in addition  in years when we reported profits  we were not profitable in each quarter during those years 
we anticipate continuing to incur significant sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses 
a high percentage of these expenses are fixed in the short term  so any delay in generating or recognizing revenue could result in a loss for a quarter or full year 
even if we are profitable  our operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our stock to fall 

table of contents we may experience challenges or delays in generating or recognizing revenue for a number of reasons and our revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following we are dependent upon obtaining orders during a quarter and shipping those orders in the same quarter to achieve our revenue objectives  acceptance provisions in customer contracts  our ability to deliver installation or inspection services by the end of the quarter  changes in general and or specific economic conditions in the networking industry  seasonal fluctuations in demand for our products and services  particularly in asia and europe  the level of attrition of our employees  and of our sales force in particular  a disproportionate percentage of our sales occurring in the last month of the quarter  our ability to ship products by the end of a quarter  reduced visibility into the implementation cycles for our products and our customers spending plans  our ability to forecast demand for our products  which in the case of lower than expected sales  may result in excess or obsolete inventory in addition to non cancelable purchase commitments for component parts  sales to the telecommunications service provider market  which represent a significant source of large product orders  are especially volatile and difficult to forecast  product returns or the cancellation or rescheduling of orders  our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements and manage product transitions  announcements and new product introductions by our competitors  our ability to develop and support relationships with enterprise customers  service providers and other potential large customers  our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions  fluctuations in warranty or other service expenses actually incurred  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our products on a timely basis  increases in the prices of the components that we purchase  decreases in the prices of the products that we sell  our ability to manage and maintain our relationships with our manufacturing partners including our ability to achieve and maintain desired production volumes and quality levels for our products  the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which products are sold  impairment charges associated with long lived assets  restructuring costs associated with adjustments to the size of our operations  costs relating to possible acquisitions and the integration of technologies or businesses  the effect of amortization of purchased intangibles resulting from new transactions  and costs relating to the recognition of share based payments  and the potential future adoption of certain accounting standards new to our business 

table of contents due to the foregoing factors  period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
intense competition in the market for networking equipment could prevent us from increasing revenue and achieving profitability 
the market for network switching solutions is intensely competitive and dominated primarily by cisco systems and a few other large companies 
most of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  broader product lines and substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources 
as a result  these competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
in addition  they have larger distribution channels  stronger brand names  access to more customers  a larger installed customer base and a greater ability to make attractive offers to channel partners and customers than we do 
for example  we have encountered  and expect to continue to encounter  many potential customers who are confident in and committed to the product offerings of our principal competitors  including cisco systems 
accordingly  these potential customers may not consider or evaluate our products 
when such potential customers have considered or evaluated our products  we have in the past lost  and expect in the future to lose  sales to some of these customers as large competitors have offered significant price discounts to secure these sales 
the pricing policies of our competitors impact the overall demand for our products and services 
some of our competitors are capable of operating at significant losses for extended periods of time  increasing pricing pressure on our products and services 
if we do not maintain competitive pricing  the demand for our products and services  as well as our market share  may decline 
from time to time  we may lower the prices of our products and services in response to competitive pressure 
when this happens  if we are unable to reduce our component costs or improve operating efficiencies  our revenue and margins will be adversely affected 
our success is dependent on our ability to continually introduce new products and features that achieve broad market acceptance 
the network equipment market is characterized by rapid technological progress  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
if we do not regularly introduce new products in this dynamic environment  our product lines will become obsolete 
these new products must be compatible and interoperate with products and architectures offered by other vendors 
we have and may in the future experience delays in product development and releases  and such delays have and could in the future adversely affect our ability to compete and our operating results 
when we announce new products or product enhancements that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing products  customers may defer or cancel orders for our existing products 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by unexpectedly decreasing sales  increasing inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
even if we introduce new switching products  alternative technologies could achieve widespread market acceptance and displace the ethernet technology on which we have based our product architecture 
for example  developments in routers and routing software could significantly reduce demand for our products 
as a result  we may not be able to achieve widespread market acceptance of our current or future new products 
the unfavorable economic environment has and may continue to negatively impact our business and operating results 
the challenges and uncertainty currently affecting economic conditions in the united states and other parts of the world may negatively impact our business and operating results in the following ways customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services  
table of contents customers may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  the amounts that they owe us which may adversely affect our cash flow  the timing of our revenue recognition and the amount of revenue  increased pricing pressure may result from our competitors aggressively discounting their products  accurate budgeting and planning will be difficult due to low visibility into future sales  forecasting customer demand will be more difficult increasing the risk of either excess and obsolete inventory if our forecast is too high or insufficient inventory to meet customer demand if our forecast is too low  and our component suppliers and contract manufactures have been negatively affected by the economy which may result in product delays and changes in pricing and service levels 
if economic conditions in the united states and other key markets deteriorate or do not show improvement  we believe that we will experience material adverse impacts to our business and operating results 
claims of infringement by others may increase and the resolution of such claims may adversely affect our operating results 
our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patents  copyrights including rights to open source software  and other intellectual property rights 
because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field  the secrecy of some pending patents and the issuance of new patents at a rapid pace  it is not possible to determine in advance if a product or component might infringe the patent rights of others 
because of the potential for courts awarding substantial damages and the lack of predictability of such awards  it is not uncommon for companies in our industry to settle even potentially unmeritorious claims for very substantial amounts 
further  the entities with whom we have or could have disputes or discussions include entities with extensive patent portfolios and substantial financial assets 
these entities are actively engaged in programs to generate substantial revenue from their patent portfolios and are seeking or may seek significant payments or royalties from us and others in our industry 
litigation resulting from claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others has resulted and could in the future result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have received notices from entities alleging that we may be infringing their patents  and we are currently parties to patent litigation as described under part i  item  legal proceedings 
without regard to the merits of these or any other claims  an adverse court order or a settlement could require us  among other actions  to stop selling our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain a royalty bearing license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or available at all  pay damages  or redesign those products that use the disputed technology 
in addition  our products include so called open source software 
open source software is typically licensed for use at no initial charge  but imposes on the user of the open source software certain requirements to license to others both the open source software as well as modifications to the open source software 
our use of open source software subjects us to certain additional risks for the following reasons open source license terms may be ambiguous and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our products  open source software cannot be protected under trade secret law  
table of contents suppliers of open source software do not provide the warranty  support and liability protections typically provided by vendors who offer proprietary software  and it may be difficult for us to accurately determine the developers of the open source code and whether the acquired software infringes third party intellectual property rights 
we believe that even if we do not infringe the rights of others  we will incur significant expenses in the future due to disputes or licensing negotiations  though the amounts cannot be determined 
these expenses may be material or otherwise adversely affect our operating results 
our operating results may be negatively affected by defending or pursuing claims or lawsuits 
we have and may in the future pursue or be subject to claims or lawsuits in the normal course of our business 
in addition to the intellectual property lawsuits described above  we are currently parties to securities and contract litigation as described in item legal proceedings 
regardless of the result  litigation can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
an unfavorable resolution of a lawsuit in which we are a defendant could result in a court order against us or payments to other parties that would have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
even if we are successful in prosecuting claims and lawsuits  we may not recover damages sufficient to cover our expenses incurred to manage  investigate and pursue the litigation 
in addition  subject to certain limitations  we may be obligated to indemnify our current and former directors  officers and employees in certain lawsuits 
we do not maintain insurance coverage which will cover all of our litigation costs and liabilities 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  our business could suffer 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot ensure that the actions we have taken will adequately protect our intellectual property rights or that other parties will not independently develop similar or competing products that do not infringe on our patents 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to and distribution of our intellectual property and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise misappropriate or use our products or technology  which would adversely affect our business 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decrease  which may reduce gross margin and or revenue 
the network equipment industry has traditionally experienced an erosion of average selling prices due to a number of factors  including competitive pricing pressures  promotional pricing and technological progress 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures  excess inventories  increased sales discounts and new product introductions by us or our competitors 
we may experience substantial decreases in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 
to maintain our gross margin  we must develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements and continually reduce our product costs 
our failure to do so would likely cause our revenue and gross margins to decline 
when our products contain undetected errors  we may incur significant unexpected expenses and could lose sales 
network products frequently contain undetected errors when new products or new versions or updates of existing products are released to the marketplace 
in the past  we have experienced such errors in connection with new products and product updates 
we have experienced component problems in prior years that caused us to 
table of contents incur higher than expected warranty  service costs and expenses  and other related operating expenses 
in the future  we expect that  from time to time  such errors or component failures will be found in new or existing products after the commencement of commercial shipments 
these problems may have a material adverse effect on our business by causing us to incur significant warranty  repair and replacement costs  diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from new product development efforts  delaying the recognition of revenue and causing significant customer relations problems 
further  if products are not accepted by customers due to such defects  and such returns exceed the amount we accrued for defect returns based on our historical experience  our operating results would be adversely affected 
we have recently introduced a new limited lifetime warranty for certain of our summit products 
as a result  our revenue from service contracts could decrease because some customers will rely on the limited lifetime warranty rather than purchasing enhanced service contracts 
our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur in a network  it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems 
the occurrence of system errors  whether or not caused by our products  could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses 
the occurrence of any such problems would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we purchase several key components for products from single or limited sources and could lose sales if these suppliers fail to meet our needs 
we currently purchase several key components used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited sources and are dependent upon supply from these sources to meet our needs 
certain components such as tantalum capacitors  sram  dram  and printed circuit boards  have been in the past  and may in the future be  in short supply 
we have encountered  and are likely in the future to encounter  shortages and delays in obtaining these or other components  and this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer orders 
our principal sole source components include asics  merchant silicon  microprocessors  programmable integrated circuits  selected other integrated circuits  custom power supplies  and custom tooled sheet metal 
our principal limited source components include flash memory  drams and srams  printed circuit boards  and cams 
we use our forecast of expected demand to determine our material requirements 
lead times for materials and components we order vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
if forecasts exceed orders  we may have excess and or obsolete inventory  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
if orders exceed forecasts  we may have inadequate supplies of certain materials and components  which could have a 
table of contents material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer delivery requirements and to recognize revenue 
for example  in our fourth fiscal quarter  customer orders exceeded our forecast  especially with respect to certain products 
this could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the first quarter of fiscal if we are unable to deliver products in a timely manner or customers cancel orders 
we do not have agreements fixing long term prices or minimum volume requirements from suppliers 
from time to time we have experienced shortages and allocations of certain components  resulting in delays in filling orders 
qualifying new suppliers to compensate for such shortages may be time consuming and costly  and may increase the likelihood of errors in design or production 
in addition  during the development of our products  we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our chipsets  which in turn has led to delays in product introductions 
similar delays may occur in the future 
furthermore  the performance of the components as incorporated in our products may not meet the quality requirements of our customers 
our dependence on four manufacturers for all of our manufacturing requirements could harm our operating results 
we rely on four companies to manufacture all of our products 
in addition  each of our products is manufactured by only one of these companies 
we have experienced delays in product shipments from contract manufacturers in the past  which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers 
these or similar problems may arise in the future  such as delivery of products of inferior quality  delivery of insufficient quantity of products  or the interruption or discontinuance of operations of a manufacturer  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
while we maintain strong relationships with our manufacturing partners  our agreements with these manufacturers are generally of limited duration and pricing  quality and volume commitments are negotiated on a recurring basis 
the failure to maintain continuing agreements with our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business 
we intend to introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require that we rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers 
as part of our cost reduction efforts  we will need to realize lower per unit product costs from our contract manufacturers by means of volume efficiencies and the utilization of manufacturing sites in lower cost geographies 
however  we cannot be certain when or if such price reductions will occur 
the failure to obtain such price reductions would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
we depend upon international sales for a significant portion of our revenue which imposes a number of risks on our business 
international sales constitute a significant portion of our net revenue 
our ability to grow will depend in part on the expansion of international sales 
our international sales primarily depend on the success of our resellers and distributors 
the failure of these resellers and distributors to sell our products internationally would limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenue 
there are a number of risks arising from our international business  including longer accounts receivable collection cycles  difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas  difficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems  the payment of operating expenses in local currencies  which exposes us to risks of currency fluctuations  higher credit risks requiring cash in advance or letters of credit  difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property  political and economic turbulence  
table of contents terrorism  war or other armed conflict  natural disasters and epidemics  potential adverse tax consequences  compliance with regulatory requirements of foreign countries  including compliance with rapidly evolving environmental regulations  and compliance with us laws and regulations pertaining to the sale and distribution of products to customers in foreign countries  including export controls and the foreign corrupt practices act 
substantially all of our international sales are us dollar denominated 
future increases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
in the future  we may elect to invoice some of our international customers in local currency  which would expose us to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the particular local currency 
if we do so  we may decide to engage in hedging transactions to minimize the risk of such fluctuations 
we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the impact of payment of operating expenses in local currencies to some of our operating foreign subsidiaries 
however  if we are not successful in managing these hedging transactions  we could incur losses from hedging activities 
we must continue to develop and increase the productivity of our indirect distribution channels to increase net revenue and improve our operating results 
our distribution strategy focuses primarily on developing and increasing the productivity of our indirect distribution channels 
if we fail to develop and cultivate relationships with significant channel partners  or if these channel partners are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our products may decrease and our operating results could suffer 
many of our channel partners also sell products from other vendors that compete with our products 
our channel partners may not continue to market or sell our products effectively or to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing and technical support 
we may not be able to successfully manage our sales channels or enter into additional reseller and or distribution agreements 
our failure to do any of these could limit our ability to grow or sustain revenue 
our operating results for any given period have and will continue to depend to a significant extent on large orders from a relatively small number of channel partners and other customers 
however  we do not have binding purchase commitments from any of them 
a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to a significant reseller  distributor or other customer could harm our business  operating results and financial condition because our expense levels are based on our expectations as to future revenue and to a large extent are fixed in the short term 
under specified conditions  some third party distributors are allowed to return products to us and unexpected returns could adversely affect our results 
the sales cycle for our products is long and we may incur substantial non recoverable expenses or devote significant resources to sales that do not occur when anticipated 
our products represent a significant strategic decision by a customer regarding its communications infrastructure 
the decision by customers to purchase our products is often based on the results of a variety of internal procedures associated with the evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance of new technologies 
accordingly  the product evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle  typically ranging from three months to longer than a year  and as a result  our ability to sell products is subject to a number of significant risks  including risks that budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews by customers will result in the loss of potential sales  
table of contents there may be substantial variation in the length of the sales cycle from customer to customer  making decisions on the expenditure of resources difficult to assess  we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management time in an attempt to initiate or increase the sale of products to customers  but not succeed  if a sales forecast from a specific customer for a particular quarter is not achieved in that quarter  we may be unable to compensate for the shortfall  which could harm our operating results  and downward pricing pressures could occur during the lengthy sales cycle for our products 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our goals 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  service and operations personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we do not have employment contracts with these individuals which mandate that they render services for any specific term  nor do we carry life insurance on any of our key personnel 
we have experienced and may in the future experience significant turn over in our executive personnel 
in addition  retention has generally become more difficult for us  in part because the exercise price of most of the stock options granted to many of our employees is below the market price 
as a result  prior to the recent economic downturn  we experienced high levels of attrition 
we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales and marketing  service  finance and operations personnel 
the market for these personnel is competitive  especially in the san francisco bay area  and we have had difficulty in hiring employees  particularly engineers  in the timeframe we desire 
companies in the networking industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we have from time to time been involved in claims like this with other companies and  although to date they have not resulted in material litigation  we do not know whether we will be involved in additional claims in the future 
we could incur substantial costs in litigating any such claims  regardless of the merits 
failure of our products to comply with evolving industry standards and complex government regulations may adversely impact our business 
if we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards and government regulations  we may not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply 
the network equipment industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid changes in technology and customers requirements and evolving industry standards 
as a result  our success depends on the timely adoption and market acceptance of industry standards  and timely resolution of conflicting us and international industry standards  and our ability to influence the development of emerging industry standards and to introduce new and enhanced products that are compatible with such standards 
in the past  we have introduced new products that were not compatible with certain technological standards  and in the future  we may not be able to effectively address the compatibility and interoperability issues that arise as a result of technological changes and evolving industry standards 
our products must also comply with various us federal government regulations and standards defined by agencies such as the federal communications commission  standards established by governmental authorities in various foreign countries and recommendations of the international telecommunication union 
in some circumstances  we must obtain regulatory approvals or certificates of compliance before we can offer or distribute our products in certain jurisdictions or to certain customers 
complying with new regulations or 
table of contents obtaining certifications can be costly and disruptive to our business 
for example  we expended significant resources and expenses in order to comply with the european union s directive ec waste electrical and electronic equipment and directive ec on restriction on the certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment 
if we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards or government regulations  we will not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our net revenue or achieving profitability 
changes in effective tax rates including from the release of the valuation allowance recorded against our net us deferred tax assets  or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns or change in ownership  could adversely affect our results 
our future effective tax rates may be volatile or adversely affected by changes in our business or us or foreign tax laws  including the partial or full release of the valuation allowance recorded against our net us deferred tax assets  expiration of or lapses in the research and development tax credit laws  transfer pricing adjustments  tax effects of stock based compensation  or costs related to restructurings 
in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
although we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes  there is no assurance that such determinations by us are in fact adequate 
changes in our effective tax rates or amounts assessed upon examination of our tax returns may have a material  adverse impact on our cash flows and our financial condition 
our future effective tax rate in particular could be adversely affected by a change in ownership pursuant to us internal revenue code section if a change in ownership occurs  it may limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses to offset our us taxable income 
if us taxable income is greater than the change in ownership limitation  we will pay a higher rate of tax with respect to the amount of taxable income that exceeds the limitation 
this would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
if we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial reporting and managerial systems and processes  our ability to manage and grow our business may be harmed 
our ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with regulations requires an effective planning and management process 
we need to continue improving our existing  and implement new  operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
any delay in the implementation of  or disruption in the transition to  new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could harm our ability to record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis  or to forecast future results 
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may cause us to delay filing our periodic reports with the sec  affect our nasdaq listing  and adversely affect our stock price 
the securities and exchange commission  as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on form k 
in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on our internal control over financial reporting 
although we review our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the section requirements  if our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented  designed  operated or reviewed  or if the independent registered public accounting firm interprets the requirements  rules and or regulations differently from our interpretation  then they may decline to attest to management s assessment or may issue an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting because of the existence of one or more material weaknesses 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which ultimately could negatively impact our stock price 

table of contents compliance with laws  rules and regulations relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
federal securities laws  rules and regulations  as well as nasdaq rules and regulations  require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures  impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements  set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers  chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations 
these laws  rules and regulations and the interpretation of these requirements are evolving  and we are making investments to evaluate current practices and to continue to achieve compliance 
as a result  our compliance programs have increased and will continue to increase general and administrative expenses and have diverted and will continue to divert management time and attention from revenue generating activities 
our headquarters and some significant supporting businesses are located in northern california and other areas subject to natural disasters that could disrupt our operations and harm our business 
our corporate headquarters are located in silicon valley in northern california 
historically  this region has been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks  such as earthquakes  fires and floods  which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our property 
we have contract manufacturers located in mexico and taiwan where similar natural disasters and other risks may disrupt the local economy and pose physical risks to our property and the property of our contract manufacturer 
in addition  the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruptions to the economies of the us and other countries 
if such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders for our products  our business and operating results will suffer 
we currently do not have redundant  multiple site capacity in the event of a natural disaster  terrorist act or other catastrophic event 
in the event of such an occurrence  our business would suffer 
failure to successfully expand our sales and support teams or educate them in regard to technologies and our product families may harm our operating results 
the sale of our products and services requires a concerted effort that is frequently targeted at several levels within a prospective customer s organization 
we may not be able to increase net revenue unless we expand our sales and support teams in order to address all of the customer requirements necessary to sell our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate employees into our company or to educate current and future employees in regard to rapidly evolving technologies and our product families 
a failure to do so may hurt our revenue growth and operating results 
we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders  cause us to incur debt and assume contingent liabilities 
as part of our business strategy  we review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that we believe would complement our current product offerings  augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities  or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt  assume contingent liabilities  or expend significant cash 

table of contents these actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or the price of our common stock 
moreover  even if we do obtain benefits in the form of increased sales and earnings  these benefits may be recognized much later than the time when the expenses associated with an acquisition are incurred 
this is particularly relevant in cases where it is necessary to integrate new types of technology into our existing portfolio and new types of products may be targeted for potential customers with which we do not have pre existing relationships 
acquisitions and investment activities also entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and or products  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or investment transaction  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  the potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations  and substantial charges for the amortization of certain purchased intangible assets  deferred stock compensation or similar items 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies  or personnel that we might acquire in the future  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may need additional capital to fund our future operations and  if it is not available when needed  our business will be adversely impacted 
we believe that our existing working capital and cash available from credit facilities and future operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  if cash from future operations is insufficient  or if cash is used for acquisitions or other currently unanticipated uses  we may need additional capital 
the development and marketing of new products and the expansion of reseller and distribution channels and associated support personnel requires a significant commitment of resources 
in addition  if the markets for our products develop more slowly than anticipated  or if we fail to establish significant market share and achieve sufficient net revenue  we may continue to consume significant amounts of capital 
as a result  we could be required to raise additional capital 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of the shares held by existing stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  such securities may provide the holders certain rights  preferences  and privileges senior to those of common stockholders  and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
we cannot assure you that additional capital  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may realize losses on our investments and be unable to liquidate these investments at desired times and in desired amounts 
at june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  investments and marketable debt securities 
these investments include us government agencies including freddie mac and fannie mae debt  corporate debt  money market funds  commercial paper and auction rate securities ars 
such investments are subject to general credit  liquidity  market and interest rate risks which have been and may further be exacerbated by the current credit crisis  financial market difficulties and poor economic conditions 
if these conditions continue or worsen  we have and may experience difficulties with the liquidity of our investments  and the value of our investments could decline which will have an adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 

table of contents for example  as of june   we held million in ars 
all of our ars had credit ratings of aaa or aaa when purchased  and none are mortgage backed debt obligations 
during february and march  auctions failed for all million of our ars because sell orders exceeded buy orders 
we may not be able to liquidate these investments unless the issuer calls the security  our broker purchases the security  a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  or the security matures 
we have entered into long term lease agreements for several facilities that are currently vacant and may be difficult to sublease due to current real estate market conditions 
we have certain long term real estate lease commitments carrying future obligations for non cancelable lease payments 
reductions in our workforce and the restructuring of operations since fiscal have resulted in the need to consolidate certain of these leased facilities  located primarily in northern california  for which we recorded a reversal of excess facilities charges of approximately million in fiscal  million expense in fiscal  million expense in fiscal  and million expense in fiscal we may incur additional charges for excess facilities as a result of additional reductions in our workforce or future restructuring of operations 
we will continue to be responsible for all carrying costs of these facilities until such time as we can sublease these facilities or terminate the applicable leases based on the contractual terms of the lease agreements  and these costs may have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our stock price has been volatile in the past and our stock price may significantly fluctuate in the future 
in the past  our common stock price has fluctuated significantly 
this could continue as we or our competitors announce new products  our results or those of our customers or competition fluctuate  conditions in the networking or semiconductor industry change  or when investors  change their sentiment toward stocks in the networking technology sector 
in addition  fluctuations in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may make our stock attractive to momentum  hedge or day trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stock rapidly  exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction  particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent an acquisition of extreme  which could decrease the value of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer 
although we believe these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law and our stockholder rights plan  which is described below  will provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders 
our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan  under which we declared and paid a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held by stockholders of record as of may  under the plan  each right will entitle stockholders to purchase a fractional share of our preferred stock for 
each such fractional share of the new preferred stock has terms designed to make it substantially the economic equivalent of one share of common stock 
initially the rights will not be exercisable and will trade with our common stock 
generally  the rights may become exercisable if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of or more 
table of contents of our common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer upon consummation of which such person or group would beneficially own or more of our common stock 
when the rights become exercisable  our board of directors has the right to authorize the issuance of one share of our common stock in exchange for each right that is then exercisable

unresolved staff comments not applicable 
item properties our principal administrative  sales  marketing and research and development facilities are located in santa clara  california 
we also lease office space and executive suites in various other geographic locations domestically and internationally for sales and service personnel and engineering operations 
our aggregate lease expense for fiscal was approximately million  net of sublease income of approximately million 
we believe our current facilities will adequately meet our growth needs for the foreseeable future  and we are actively engaged in efforts to sublease excess space we acquired in prior years to meet the anticipated growth at that time 
item legal proceedings we may from time to time be party to litigation arising in the course of our business  including  without limitation  allegations relating to commercial transactions  business relationships or intellectual property rights 
such claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
litigation in general  and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular  can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
shareholder litigation relating to historical stock option practices on april   an individual identifying herself as one of our shareholders filed a derivative action in the united states district court for the northern district of california purporting to assert claims on behalf of us and in our name against various of our current and former directors and officers relating to historical stock option granting from to and related accounting practices 
two similar derivative actions were filed thereafter in the same court by other individuals and the three cases were consolidated by order of the court 
after two amended complaints were filed by the lead plaintiff  we filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint  which was granted without prejudice on august  on august   kathleen wheatley  an individual identifying herself as one of our shareholders  filed a motion for the court to reconsider its ruling on august  granting our motion to dismiss

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we develop and sell network infrastructure equipment and offer related services contracts for extended warranty and maintenance to our enterprise  data center and metropolitan telecommunications service provider customers 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from the sale of our networking equipment and related service contracts 
in fiscal  our revenue decreased million  gross profit decreased million  operating profit decreased million and net income decreased million as compared to fiscal we believe that understanding the following key developments is helpful to an understanding of our operating results for fiscal impact of the global economic developments 
we believe that the credit market crisis  global recession and other challenges affecting economic conditions in the united states and other parts of the world were the primary drivers of our financial performance during fiscal recently  we did experience some improvements in our results with increases in revenue of million  gross profit of million  operating profit of million and net income of million sequentially from the third fiscal quarter to the fourth fiscal quarter of however  we believe that limited access to credit  conservative purchasing patterns and delays or cancellation of it infrastructure plans in the face of continued uncertainty regarding the global economy will continue to negatively impact demand for networking solutions  including ethernet equipment 
for example  we experienced a decline in revenue in emea of million sequentially from the third fiscal quarter to the fourth fiscal quarter of this represents a change from the growth that we have seen in our emea region in prior quarters 
increasing demand for bandwidth while economic conditions substantially decreased demand for networking equipment during our fiscal year  we believe that the continued increase in demand for bandwidth will drive future demand for high performance ethernet solutions 
wide spread adoption of electronic communications in all aspects of our lives  proliferation of next generation converged mobile devices  deployment of triple play services to residences and the rapidly growing adoption of internet cloud solutions offer our customers the opportunity to reduce expenses  improve efficiency and or increase revenue 
in order to realize the benefits of these developments  customers require additional bandwidth and high performance from their network infrastructure at affordable prices 
as the economy recovers  we believe that the ethernet segment of the networking equipment market will resume growth as enterprise  data center and carrier customers continue to recognize the performance and operating cost benefits of ethernet technology 
increased product breadth we believe that continued success in our marketplace will depend on our ability to develop new and enhanced products employing leading edge technology 
in fiscal  we delivered to the market a new and expanded portfolio of next generation stackable and modular products for the data center and metropolitan service provider markets 
industry developments the market for network infrastructure equipment is highly competitive and dominated by a few large companies 
the difficult economic climate has further driven consolidation of vendors within the ethernet networking market and with vendors from adjacent markets  including storage  security  wireless and voice applications 
we believe that the underpinning technology for all of these adjacent markets is ethernet 
as a result  independent ethernet switch vendors are being acquired or merged with larger  adjacent market vendors to 
table of contents enable them to deliver complete and broad solutions 
as a result  we believe that  as an independent ethernet switch vendor  we must provide products that  when combined with the products of our large strategic partners  create compelling solutions for end user customers 
restructuring during fiscal  we reduced employee headcount by approximately 
as a result of these actions  we have recorded a restructuring charge of million  net of reversal  for severance  asset and facility charges partially offset by a million adjustment resulting from additional sublease income related to prior restructuring charges  netting million of restructuring charges for the year 
we have taken and plan to continue to take other steps to manage our business in the current economic environment 
for example  we have reduced our contingent work force  scheduled shutdown weeks  reduced travel and other discretionary spending  and restricted hiring activities

some of the primary factors affecting gross profit include demand for our products  changes in our pricing policies and those of our competitors  and the mix of products sold 
our gross profit may be adversely affected by increases in material or labor costs  increases in warranty expense or the cost of providing services under extended service contracts  heightened price competition  obsolescence charges and higher inventory balances 
in addition  our gross profit may fluctuate due to the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold  including the effects of our two tier distribution model

critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of consolidated financial 
table of contents statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates  assumptions and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience  market trends and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe the critical accounting policies stated below  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
share based payments share based compensation recognized in the financial statements by line item caption is as follows dollars in thousands year ended june  june  july  cost of product revenue cost of service revenue sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total share based compensation expense share based compensation cost capitalized in inventory total share based compensation cost in accordance with fas r  the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option valuation model with the weighted average assumptions noted in the table in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
expected volatility is based on both the implied volatilities from traded options on our stock and historical volatility on our stock 
for options granted prior to july   and valued on a pro forma basis in accordance with fas  the expected volatility used to estimate the fair value of the options was based solely on the historical volatility on our stock  we used the graded vesting method for expense attribution  and we recognized option forfeitures as they occurred as allowed by fas for options granted after july   and valued in accordance with fas r  the expected volatility used to estimate the fair value of the options was based on a combination of the historical volatility on our stock and the implied volatility  we used the straight line method for expense attribution and we estimate forfeitures and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
our estimated forfeiture rate in fiscal  based on our historical forfeiture experience  is approximately 
the black scholes merton option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based award and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in 
table of contents calculating the fair value of share based compensation represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our share based compensation expense could have been materially different 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be materially different 
revenue recognition historically  our products have been hardware focused and we have recognized revenue in accordance with the principles of sab and eitf we have monitored a variety of factors with respect to our product evolution  including whether the software component of our products is becoming more than incidental to the hardware product 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we concluded that software had become more than incidental to the product shipped 
effective beginning the first quarter of fiscal  for sales related to products shipped during the quarter containing software that was more than incidental  we adopted the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position software revenue recognition sop and related interpretations relating to the sale of products with a significant software component 
such shipments grew during the second quarter of fiscal to represent of a majority of our shipped products 
for arrangements with multiple software elements  we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements 
we determine vendor specific objective evidence of fair value based on the price charged when the item is sold separately 
the adoption of sop did not have a significant impact on our results of operations in fiscal  as we had enhanced the standardization of our internal processes and pricing in anticipation of the application of sop we derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our networking equipment  with the remaining revenue generated from service fees relating to the service contracts  professional services  and training on our products 
we generally recognize product revenue from our value added resellers  non stocking distributors and end user customers at the time of shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price of the product is fixed or determinable and collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured 
in instances where the criteria for revenue recognition are not met  revenue is deferred until all criteria have been met 
revenue from service obligations under service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual service period 
service contracts typically range from one to two years 
our total deferred product revenue was million and million as of june  and june   respectively 
our total deferred revenue for services  primarily from service contracts  was million and million as of june  and june   respectively 
service contracts typically range from one to two years 
we make certain sales to partners in two distribution channels  or tiers 
the first tier consists of a limited number of independent distributors that sell primarily to resellers and  on occasion  to end user customers 
we grant stocking distributors the right to return a portion of unsold inventory to us for the purpose of stock rotation 
we defer recognition of revenue on all sales until the distributors sell the product  as evidenced by monthly sales out reports that the distributors provide to us 
we also grant these distributors certain price protection rights 
the distributor related deferred revenue and receivables are adjusted at the time of the stock rotation return or price reduction 
we also provide distributors with credits for changes in selling prices  and allow distributors to participate in cooperative marketing programs 
we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these exposures based upon our contractual obligations 
in connection with cooperative advertising programs  we do not meet the criteria in eitf for recognizing the expenses as marketing expenses and accordingly  the costs are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 

table of contents the second tier of the distribution channel consists of a large number of third party value added resellers that sell directly to end users 
for product sales to value added resellers  we do not grant return privileges  except for defective products during the warranty period  nor do we grant pricing credits 
accordingly  we recognize revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the value added reseller  which is generally upon shipment 
we reduce product revenue for cooperative marketing activities that may occur under contractual arrangements that we have with our resellers 
we provide an allowance for sales returns based on our historical returns  analysis of credit memo data and our return policies 
the allowance for sales returns was million and million as of june  and june   respectively  for estimated future returns that were recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable 
the provision for returns is charged to net revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  and was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
if the historical data that we use to calculate the estimated sales returns and allowances does not properly reflect future levels of product returns  these estimates will be revised  thus resulting in an impact on future net revenue 
we estimate and adjust this allowance at each balance sheet date 
inventory valuation our inventory balance was million as of june   compared with million as of june  we value our inventory at lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis 
we provide inventory allowances based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts 
the allowance is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and charged to the provision for inventory  which is a component of cost of sales 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
any written down or obsolete inventory subsequently sold has not had a material impact on gross margin for any of the periods disclosed 
inventory write downs charged to cost of product revenue were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments would significantly impact the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
in the future  if we find that our estimates are too optimistic and we determine that our inventory needs to be written down  we will be required to recognize such costs in our cost of product revenue at the time of such determination 
conversely  if we find our estimates are too pessimistic and we subsequently sell product that has previously been written down  our operating margin in that period will be favorably impacted 
accrued warranty networking products may contain undetected hardware or software errors when new products or new versions or updates of existing products are released to the marketplace 
in the past  we had experienced such errors in connection with products and product updates 
our standard hardware warranty period is typically months from the date of shipment to end users and days for software 
for certain access products  we offer a limited lifetime hardware warranty commencing on the date of shipment from us and ending five years following the our announcement of the end of sale of such product 
upon shipment of products to our customers  including both end users and channel partners  we estimate expenses for the cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty and accrue a liability through charges to cost of product revenue for this amount 
our accrued warranty balance was million as of june   compared to million as of june  the determination of our warranty requirements is based on our actual historical experience with the product or product family  estimates of repair and replacement costs and any product warranty problems that are 
table of contents identified after shipment 
we estimate and adjust this accrual at each balance sheet date in accordance with changes in these factors 
in fiscal year  we recorded million benefit for a change in estimates in warranty reserve resulting from reduction in actual returns and associated warranty cost 
the cost of new warranties issued that was charged to cost of product revenue was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal while we believe that our warranty accrual is adequate and that the judgments applied in calculating this accrual are appropriate  the assumptions used are based on estimates and these estimated amounts could differ materially from our actual warranty expenses in the future 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million and million as of june  and june   respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts for trade accounts receivable as of june  was million  compared to million as of june  we continually monitor and evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for bad debts in general and administrative expense when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such as current trends in the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
we mitigate some collection risk by requiring most of our customers in the asia pacific region  excluding japan and australia  to pay cash in advance or secure letters of credit when placing an order with us 
our provision for doubtful accounts was an expense of million in fiscal  expense of million in fiscal and in fiscal if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  or if other circumstances arise  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  and additional allowances could be required 
we write off receivables to the allowance after all collection efforts are exhausted 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining our valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we make an assessment of the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not believed to be likely  a valuation allowance is established 
we provided a full valuation allowance against all of our us federal and state net deferred tax assets in fiscal in the amount of million in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in fiscal  the valuation allowance decreased by million to  and in fiscal  the valuation allowance decreased by million to million 
the valuation allowance is determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas  which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
in accordance with sfas  evidence  such as the current worldwide recession  quarterly losses and the challenge of forecasting financials in this economic environment  was given more weight than recent cumulative profits 
accordingly  we believe that there is sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our u 
s federal and state net deferred tax assets under sfas this valuation allowance will be evaluated periodically and can be reversed partially or totally if business results have sufficiently improved to support realization of our deferred tax assets 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin in our first fiscal 
table of contents quarter fin is an interpretation of fasb statement  accounting for income taxes  and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
under fin  an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
as of june   we have million of unrecognized tax benefits pursuant to fin if fully recognized in the future  million would impact our effective tax rate  and million would result in adjustments to deferred tax assets and corresponding adjustments to the valuation allowance 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrealized tax benefits could decrease by million during the next months due to the expiration of the statue of limitations in a foreign jurisdiction 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings  including negotiations regarding potential licenses from third parties who have notified us that they believe our products may infringe certain patents 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter  whether litigation or licensing negotiation  and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals  if any  are based only on the most current and dependable information available at any given time 
as additional information becomes available  we may reassess the potential liability from pending claims and litigation and the probability of claims being successfully asserted against us 
as a result  we may revise our estimates related to these pending claims and litigation 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows in the future 
for further detail  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of legal proceedings 
liquidity and capital resources the following summarizes information regarding our cash and investments and working capital in thousands as of june  june  cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities working capital the decrease in working capital as of june  as compared to june  is primarily due a decrease in cash and short term investments 
see key components of cash flows and liquidity below for further details 
key components of cash flows and liquidity a summary of the sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents is as follows in thousands year ended june  june  july  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities were million and million at june  and june   respectively  representing a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily due to the use of million to repurchase  shares of common stock and capital expenditures of million  offset by million received for common stock purchases and million provided by operations 
cash provided by operating activities was million  a decrease of million compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal net income was million and included significant non cash charges including depreciation of million  million in share based compensation expense and million in the provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
accounts receivable  net  decreased to million at june  from million at june  days sales outstanding in receivables decreased to days at june  from days at june  the decrease in accounts receivable and days sales outstanding were primarily due to decreased revenue 
inventories decreased to million at june  from million at june  inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times and avoid stock outs with the risk of inventory excess or obsolescence because of declining demand  rapidly changing technology  environmental regulations and customer requirements 
deferred revenue  net decreased to million at june  from million at june  this decrease was due primarily to lower product sales which decreased sales of service agreements as well 
cash flow provided by investing activities was million 
capital expenditures were million and purchases of investments were million  offset by proceeds from maturities of investments and marketable securities of million and sales of investments and marketable securities of million 
cash used in financing activities was million 
cash used to repurchase common stock  including expenses  was million  offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock of million 
we repurchased  shares of our common stock on september  at per share 
total cash expenditures were million for the common stock repurchased  including direct costs associated with the repurchase 
primarily as a result of the share repurchase  our outstanding shares of common stock decreased from  as of august  to  as of june  we have a revolving line of credit for million with a major lending institution which was renewed on january   and is contractually available to us until january  borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
as of june   there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility 
the line of credit contains a provision for the issuance of letters of credit not to exceed the unused balance of the line 
as of june   we had issued a letter of credit totaling million to the employment development department to fulfill our obligations under the self insured voluntary disability plan 
the line of credit requires us to maintain specified financial covenants related to tangible net worth and liquidity with which we were in compliance as of june  in october  we entered into a secured line of credit with ubs  collateralized by our auction rate securities ars held by ubs 
the maximum amount of credit available under this line of credit is million 
on november  we accepted the ubs rights offer and hence the terms of the no net cost loan program apply to this line of credit 
under this program  the interest rate on this secured credit facility will be equivalent to the interest rate earned by us on the ars at ubs  resulting in no net interest cost to us 
there are currently no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit 

table of contents contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at june   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands less than year more than five years total years years contractual obligations non cancelable inventory purchase commitments non cancelable operating lease obligations other non cancelable purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations non cancelable inventory purchase commitments represent the purchase of long lead time component inventory that our contract manufacturers procure in accordance with our forecast 
inventory purchase commitments were million as of june   a decrease of million from million as of june  the decrease was primarily related to lower projected sales in the first quarter of fiscal as compared to higher projected sales in the first quarter of fiscal we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of june  other non cancelable purchase commitments represent oem and technology agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of june  capital resources and financial condition as of june   in addition to million in cash and cash equivalents  we had million invested in short term and million invested in long term marketable investments for a total cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities of million 
at june   we held approximately million par value of illiquid non current auction rate securities ars 
the decline in value of these securities reflects market related liquidity conditions resulting from the general collapse of the credit markets and not the issuer s creditworthiness 
the ars are collateralized by student loan portfolios that are approximately guaranteed by the us department of education and maintain a credit rating of aaa and aa 
historically  these securities provided liquidity to investors through their interest rate reset feature ie  interest rates on these securities are reset through a bidding process or auction at frequent  pre determined intervals typically every to days 
at each reset  investors could either rollover and maintain their holdings or liquidate them at par value 
since february  auctions related to our ars have failed as a result of the deterioration of the credit markets  rendering these securities illiquid 
on november   we accepted an offer the ubs rights offer from ubs ag ubs  providing us with certain rights related to our ars the rights 
the rights permit us to require ubs to purchase our ars at par value  which is defined as the price equal to the liquidation preference of the ars plus accrued but unpaid dividends or interest  at any time during the period of june  through july  conversely  ubs has the right  in its discretion  to purchase or sell our ars at any time until july   so long as we receive payment at par value upon any sale or disposition 
we expect to sell our ars under the rights in the period beginning in however  if the rights are not exercised before july  they will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligation to buy our ars 
so long as we hold our ars  they will continue to accrue interest as determined by the auction process or the terms of the ars if the auction process fails 
in october  we and ubs entered into a secured line of credit collateralized by our ars held by ubs 
the maximum amount of credit available under this line of credit is million 
when we accepted the ubs rights offer in november  the terms of the ubs no net cost loan program were applied to this line of 
table of contents credit 
under this program  the interest rate on this secured credit facility will be equivalent to the interest rate earned by us on the ars  resulting in no net interest cost to us 
there are currently no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit 
we require substantial capital to fund our business  particularly to finance inventories and accounts receivable and for capital expenditures 
as a result  we could be required to raise substantial additional capital at any time 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to existing stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
if we are unable to obtain such additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and cash available from credit facilities and future operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  other non government debt securities and money market funds 
we hold a variety of interest bearing ars that represent investments in pools of student loans 
these ars investments are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected all of our holdings in ars investments and auctions for our investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
on november   we accepted the ubs rights offer from ubs  providing us with rights related to our ars 
the rights permit us to require ubs to purchase our ars at par value  which is defined as the price equal to the liquidation preference of the ars plus accrued but unpaid dividends or interest  at any time during the period of june  through july  conversely  ubs has the right  in its discretion  to purchase or sell our ars at any time until july   so long as we receive payment at par value upon any sale or disposition 
we expect to sell our ars under the rights in the period beginning in however  if the rights are not exercised before july  they will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligation to buy our ars 
so long as we hold our ars  they will continue to accrue interest as determined by the auction process or the terms of the ars if the auction process fails 
as of june   we continue to classify our entire balance of ars in long term marketable securities in our consolidated balance sheet 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact its valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities  discount rates and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur  we may be required to record impairment charges in future quarters 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of june  and june  maturing in three months or less three months to one year greater than one year total fair value in thousands june  included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rate included in marketable securities weighted average interest rate 
table of contents maturing in three months or less three months to one year greater than one year total fair value in thousands june  included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rate included in marketable securities weighted average interest rate exchange rate sensitivity currently  substantially all of our sales and the majority of our expenses are denominated in united states dollars and  as a result  we have experienced no significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
while we conduct some sales transactions and incur certain operating expenses in foreign currencies and expect to continue to do so  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant  in part because of our foreign exchange risk management process discussed below 
foreign exchange forward contracts we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain operating expenses  denominated in japanese yen  the euro  the swedish krona and the british pound 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted sfas 
at june   these forward foreign currency contracts had a notional principal amount of million and fair value is insignificant 
these contracts have maturities of less than days 
additionally  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in japanese yen  the euro  the swedish krona and the british pound 
these derivatives are not designated as hedges under sfas at june   we held foreign currency forward contracts with a notional principal amount and fair value of million and million 
these contracts have maturities of less than days 
changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange forward contracts are offset largely by remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses from operations  including the impact of hedging  were a loss of million in fiscal  a loss of million in fiscal and a loss of million in fiscal
