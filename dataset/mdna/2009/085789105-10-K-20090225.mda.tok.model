company owned drilling rigs 
during and  we purchased three drilling rigs 
owning these rigs allowed us to successfully meet a portion of our drilling needs in uinta and piceance 
two of these rigs are leased to a drilling rig operator on a short term basis and are not currently drilling on the company s properties and one rig is idle 
as the rig market and our rig requirements change  we continue to evaluate the ownership of these rigs and million related to the disposal and impairment of certain drilling rigs and related equipment  was recorded in see note to the financial statements 
other 
at year end  we had two subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method see note to the financial statements 
we had no special purpose entities and no off balance sheet debt 
see discussion of our related party transaction at note to the financial statements 
environmental and other regulations 
we are committed to responsible management of the environment and prudent health and safety policies  as these areas relate to our operations 
we strive to achieve the long term goal of sustainable development within the framework of sound environmental  health and safety practices and standards 
we strive to make environmental  health and safety protection an integral part of all business activities  from the acquisition and management of our resources to the decommissioning and reclamation of our wells and facilities 
we have programs in place to identify and manage known risks  to train employees in the proper performance of their duties and to incorporate viable new technologies into our operations 
the costs incurred to ensure compliance with environmental  health and safety laws and other regulations are normal operating expenses and are not material to our operating costs 
there can be no assurances  however  that changes in  or additions to  laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment will not have an impact in the future 
we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is customary in the industry although we are not fully insured against all environmental or other risks 
environmental regulation 
our oil and gas exploration  production and related operations are subject to numerous and frequently changing federal  state  tribal and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
environmental laws and regulations may require the acquisition of certain permits prior to or in connection with drilling activities or other operations  restrict or prohibit the types  quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment including releases in connection with drilling and production  restrict or prohibit drilling activities or other operations that could impact wetlands  endangered or threatened species or other protected areas or natural resources  require remedial action to mitigate pollution from ongoing or former operations  such as cleanup of environmental contamination  pit cleanups and plugging of abandoned wells  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations 
see item a risk factors we are subject to complex federal  state  regional  local and other laws and regulations that could give rise to substantial liabilities from environmental contamination or otherwise adversely affect our cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 

table of contents regulation of oil and gas 
the oil and gas industry  including our operations  is extensively regulated by numerous federal  state and local authorities  and with respect to tribal lands  native american tribes 
these types of regulations include requiring permits for the drilling of wells  the posting of drilling bonds and the reports concerning operations 
regulations may also govern the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the rates of production or allowables  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells  and the notifying of surface owners and other third parties 
certain laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 
we are also subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to native american tribal surface ownership  to native american oil and gas leases and other exploration agreements  fees  taxes  or other burdens  obligations and issues unique to oil and gas ownership and operations within native american reservations 
federal energy regulation 
the enactment of purpa  as amended  and the adoption of regulations thereunder by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc provided incentives for the development of cogeneration facilities such as ours 
a domestic electricity generating project must be a qf under ferc regulations in order to benefit from certain rate and regulatory incentives provided by purpa 
purpa provides two primary benefits to qfs 
first  qfs generally are relieved of compliance with extensive federal and state regulations that control the financial structure of an electricity generating plant and the prices and terms on which electricity may be sold by the plant 
second  ferc s regulations promulgated under purpa require that electric utilities purchase electricity generated by qfs at a price based on the purchasing utility s avoided cost  and that the utility sell back up power to the qf on a non discriminatory basis 
the term avoided cost is defined as the incremental cost to an electric utility of electric energy or capacity  or both  which  but for the purchase from qfs  such utility would generate for itself or purchase from another source 
the energy policy act of amends purpa to allow a utility to petition ferc to be relieved of its obligation to enter into any new contracts with qfs if ferc determines that a competitive wholesale electricity market is available to qfs in the service territory 
such a determination has not been made for our service areas in california 
this amendment does not affect any of our current so contracts 
ferc issued an order on october  implementing this amendment to purpa and on december  issued a subsequent order granting limited rehearing of the october  order 
ferc regulations also permit qfs and utilities to negotiate agreements for utility purchases of power at rates lower than the utilities avoided costs 
state energy regulation 
the cpuc has broad authority to regulate both the rates charged by  and the financial activities of  electric utilities operating in california and to promulgate regulation for implementation of purpa 
since a power sales agreement becomes a part of a utility s cost structure generally reflected in its retail rates  power sales agreements with independent electricity producers  such as us  are potentially under the regulatory purview of the cpuc and in particular the process by which the utility has entered into the power sales agreements 
while we are not subject to regulation by the cpuc  the cpuc s implementation of purpa is important to us 

table of contents item a 
risk factors other factors affecting the company s business and financial results oil and gas prices fluctuate widely  and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our revenues  profitability and future growth and reserve calculations depend substantially on the price received for our oil and gas production 
these prices also affect the amount of our cash flow available for capital expenditures  working capital and payments on our debt and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
the oil and natural gas markets fluctuate widely  and we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices 
prices for oil and natural gas may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control  such as regional  domestic and foreign supply and perceptions of supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  level of consumer demand  weather conditions  overall domestic and global political and economic conditions technological advances affecting energy consumption and supply  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation  the impact of energy conservation efforts  the capacity  cost and availability of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities  the price and availability of alternative fuels 
our revenue  profitability and cash flow depend upon the prices and demand for oil and natural gas  and a drop in prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth 
in particular  declines in commodity prices will reduce the amount of cash flow available to make capital expenditures or make acquisitions  reduce the number of our drilling locations  increase the likelihood of refinery default  negatively impact the value of our reserves  because declines in oil and natural gas prices would reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically  and limit our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital 
our level of indebtedness may limit our financial flexibility 
as of december  our total debt was billion which is comprised of million outstanding on our senior subordinated notes due and million drawn under our credit facilities 
our level of indebtedness affects our operations in several ways  including the following a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes  we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt  the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and future indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds  pay dividends and make certain investments and may also affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in the economy and in our industry  additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants  and changes in the credit ratings of our debt may negatively affect the cost  terms  conditions and availability of future financing  and lower ratings may increase the interest rate and fees we pay on our revolving bank credit facility 
a higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our obligations 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance 
general economic conditions  oil and natural gas prices and financial  business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt  and future working capital  borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt 
factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions  the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital 

table of contents the borrowing base under our credit facility may be insufficient to fund our outstanding debt 
the amount we are able to borrow under our senior secured credit facility is determined based on the value of our proved oil and gas reserves and is based on oil and natural gas price assumptions which vary by individual lender 
our borrowing base is subject to redetermination twice each year in april and october with the option for one additional redetermination each year 
should there be a deficiency in the amount of our borrowing base in comparison to our outstanding debt under the facility we would be required to repay any such deficiency in two equal installments  and days after the redetermination 
our heavy crude in california may be less economic than lighter crude oil and natural gas 
as of december   approximately of our proved reserves  or million barrels  consisted of heavy oil 
light crude oil represented and natural gas represented of our oil and gas reserves 
heavy crude oil sells for a discount to light crude oil  as more complex refining equipment is required to convert heavy oil into high value products 
additionally  most of our crude oil in california is produced using the enhanced oil recovery process of steam injection 
this process is generally more costly than primary and secondary recovery methods 
purchasers of our crude oil and natural gas may become insolvent 
we have significant concentrations of credit risk with the purchasers of our crude oil and natural gas 
we have had a long term contract to sell all of our heavy crude oil in california for approximately below wti  the us benchmark crude oil pricing  with big west of california bwoc 
on december   flying j  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary big west oil and its wholly owned subsidiary bwoc each filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
also in december  bwoc informed the company that it was unable to receive the company s production 
we have entered into various currently short term agreements with other companies to sell our california oil production 
pricing and volumes under these agreements vary with prices ranging from just above the posted price for san joaquin heavy oil to the posted price less a discount 
bwoc is evaluating several options  including a sale of the bakersfield  california refinery 
we recorded million of bad debt expense in for the bankruptcy of bwoc 
of the million due from bwoc  million represents december crude oil sales by the company and represents an administrative claim under the bankruptcy proceedings and million represents november crude oil sales which would have the same priority as other general unsecured claims 
bwoc will also be liable to us for damages under this contract 
while we also have guarantees from big west oil and from flying j  inc in the amount of million each  the information received from the bankruptcy proceedings to date has not provided us with adequate data from which to make a conclusion that any amounts will be collected nor whether bwoc will assume or reject our agreement 
additionally  all of our crude oil in utah is sold under a long term contract to a single refiner 
under the standard credit terms with our refiners  we may not know that a refiner will be unable to make payment to us until days of our production has been delivered to them 
if our purchasers become insolvent  we may not be able to collect any of the amounts owed to us 
we may be unable to meet our drilling obligations 
we have drilling obligations in both the piceance assets in colorado and our lake canyon asset in utah 
in the piceance basin  we must drill additional wells by february to avoid penalties of million per well and loss of related leases 
in lake canyon  we must drill an additional wells by november to avoid the loss of related leases 
our ability to meet these commitments depends on the capital resources available to us to fund our drilling activities and the commodity price environment which affects the economics of these projects 
our financial counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations 
we rely on financial institutions to fund their obligations under our senior secured credit facility and make payments to us under our hedging agreements 
if one or more of our financial counterparties becomes insolvent  they may not be able to meet their commitment to fund future borrowings under our credit facility which would reduce our liquidity 
additionally  at current commodity prices  a significant portion of our cash flow over the next two years will come from payments from our counterparties on our commodity hedging contracts 
if our counterparties are not able to make these payments  our cash flow will be reduced 
a widening of commodity differentials may adversely impact our revenues and our economics 
our crude oil and natural gas are priced in the local markets where the production occurs based on local or regional supply and demand factors 
the prices that we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production are generally lower than the relevant benchmark prices  such as nymex  that are used for calculating commodity derivative positions 
the difference between the benchmark price and the price we receive is called a differential 
we may not be able to accurately predict natural gas and crude oil differentials 

table of contents price differentials may widen in the future 
numerous factors may influence local pricing  such as refinery capacity  pipeline capacity and specifications  upsets in the mid stream or downstream sectors of the industry  trade restrictions and governmental regulations 
we may be adversely impacted by a widening differential on the products we sell 
our oil and natural gas hedges are based on wti or natural gas index prices  so we may be subject to basis risk if the differential on the products we sell widens from those benchmarks and we do not have a contract tied to those benchmarks 
additionally  insufficient pipeline capacity or trucking capability and the lack of demand in any given operating area may cause the differential to widen in that area compared to other oil and natural gas producing areas 
increases in the differential between the benchmark price for oil and natural gas and the wellhead price we receive could adversely affect our financial condition 
market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to crude oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities 
our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems  pipelines  processing facilities  trucking capability and refineries owned and operated by third parties 
our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 
we may be required to shut in wells for a lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of natural gas pipelines  gathering system capacity  processing facilities or refineries 
if that were to occur  then we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until arrangements were made to deliver the production to market 
we may not be able to deliver minimum crude oil volumes required by our sales contract 
production volumes from our uinta properties over the next five years are uncertain and there is no assurance that we will be able to consistently meet the minimum contractual requirement 
after partial completion of its refinery expansion in salt lake city in march  the refiner increased its total purchased volumes to  bbl d 
during the term of the contract  the minimum number of delivered barrels base daily volume is  bbl d 
in the event that we cannot produce the necessary volume  we may need to purchase crude to meet our contract requirements 
current gross oil production from our uinta properties is approximately  bbl d 
we may be subject to the risk of adding additional steam generation equipment if the electrical market deteriorates significantly 
we are dependent on several cogeneration facilities that  combined  provide approximately of our steam capacity 
these facilities are dependent on reasonable power contracts for the sale of electricity 
if  for any reason  including if utilities that purchase electricity from us are no longer required by regulation to enter into power contracts with us  we were unable to enter into new or replacement contracts or were to lose any existing contract  we may not be able to supply of the steam requirements necessary to maximize production from our heavy oil assets 
an additional investment in various steam sources may be necessary to replace such steam  and there may be risks and delays in being able to install conventional steam equipment due to permitting requirements and availability of equipment 
the financial cost and timing of such new investment may adversely affect our production  capital outlays and cash provided by operating activities 
all of our power contracts expire in covering our electricity generation 
the future of the electricity market in california is uncertain 
we utilize cogeneration plants in california to generate lower cost steam compared to conventional steam generation methods 
electricity produced by our cogeneration plants is sold to utilities and the steam costs are allocated to our oil and gas operations 
all of our electricity sales contracts in place with the utilities are currently scheduled to terminate in and while we intend to enter into future contacts with the utilities all of the terms of such contracts are not known 
additionally legal and regulatory decisions especially related to the pricing of electricity under the contracts such as the srac decision and the pending issues as to effective dates on retroactivity  can by reducing our electricity revenues adversely affect the economics of our cogeneration facilities and as a result the cost of steam for use in our oil and gas operations 
a shortage of natural gas in california could adversely affect our business 
we may be subject to the risks associated with a shortage of natural gas and or the transportation of natural gas into and within california 
we are highly dependent on sufficient volumes of natural gas necessary to use for fuel in generating steam in our heavy oil operations in california 
if the required volume of natural gas for use in our operations were to be unavailable or too highly priced to produce heavy oil economically  our production could be adversely impacted 
we have firm transportation to move  mmbtu d on the kern river pipeline from the rocky mountains to kern county  ca  which accounts for approximately one third of our current requirement 
our use of oil and gas price and interest rate hedging contracts involves credit risk and may limit future revenues from price increases or reduced expenses from lower interest rates  as well as result in significant fluctuations in net income and shareholders equity 
we use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production with the objective of achieving a more predictable cash flow  and reducing our exposure to a significant decline in the price of crude oil and natural gas 
we also utilize interest rate hedges to fix the rate on a portion of our variable rate indebtedness  as only a portion of our total indebtedness has a fixed rate and we are therefore exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
while the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines or rising interest rates  as applicable  their use may also limit future revenues from price increases or reduced expenses from lower interest rates  as applicable 
hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations 

table of contents our future success depends on our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves 
to maintain production levels  we must locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those depleted by production 
without successful exploration  exploitation or acquisition activities  our reserves  production and revenues will decline 
we may not be able to find  develop or to acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost 
in addition  substantial capital is required to replace and grow reserves 
if lower oil and gas prices or operating difficulties result in our cash flow from operations being less than expected or limit our ability to borrow under credit arrangements  we may be unable to expend the capital necessary to locate and to develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves 
actual quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves and future cash flows from those reserves  future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures and operating expenses most likely will vary from estimates 
it is not possible to measure underground accumulations of oil or natural gas in an exact way 
estimating accumulations of oil and gas is a complex process that relies on subjective interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  such as oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds  some of which are mandated by the sec 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of quality and quantity of available data  interpretation of that data  and accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions 
any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of development and exploration and prevailing oil and gas prices 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
future commodity price declines and or increased capital costs may result in a write down of our asset carrying values which could adversely affect our results of operations and limit our ability to borrow funds 
declines in oil and natural gas prices may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
if this occurs  or if our estimates of development costs increase  production data factors change or drilling results deteriorate  accounting rules may require us to write down  as a non cash charge to earnings  the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for impairments 
we capitalize costs to acquire  find and develop our oil and gas properties under the successful efforts accounting method 
if net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed fair value  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
we review the carrying value of our properties annually and at any time when events or circumstances indicate a review is necessary  based on estimated prices as of the end of the reporting period 
the carrying value of oil and gas properties is computed on a field by field basis 
once incurred  a writedown of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or gas prices increase 
while we did not have any impairment charges in  it is possible that declining commodity prices could prompt an impairment in the future 
we may incur impairment charges in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period incurred and on our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility 
competitive industry conditions may negatively affect our ability to conduct operations 
competition in the oil and gas industry is intense  particularly with respect to the acquisition of producing properties and of proved undeveloped acreage 
major and independent oil and gas companies actively bid for desirable oil and gas properties  as well as for the equipment  supplies  labor and services required to operate and develop their properties 
some of these resources may be limited and have higher prices due to current strong demand 
many of our competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than ours  which may adversely affect our ability to compete within the industry 
many of our larger competitors not only drill for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional  national or worldwide basis 
these companies may be able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties and evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial or human resources permit 
in addition  there is substantial competition for investment capital in the oil and gas industry 
these larger companies may have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low oil and natural gas prices and to absorb the burden of present and future federal  state  local and other laws and regulations 
our inability to compete effectively with larger companies could have a material adverse impact on our business activities  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents drilling is a high risk activity 
our future success will partly depend on the success of our drilling program 
in addition to the numerous operating risks described in more detail below  these drilling activities involve the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered 
also  we are often uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling  completing and producing wells 
furthermore  drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including obtaining government and tribal required permits  unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with governmental or landowner requirements  and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment and or services  including experienced labor 
the oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses  insurance will not protect us against all of these risks 
these risks include fires  explosions  blow outs  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas  formation water or drilling fluids  natural disasters  pipe or cement failures  casing collapses  embedded oilfield drilling and service tools  abnormally pressured formations  major equipment failures  including cogeneration facilities  and environmental hazards such as oil spills  natural gas leaks  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these events occur  we could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life  severe damage or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage  investigatory and clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties  suspension of operations  and repairs to resume operations 
if we experience any of these problems  our ability to conduct operations could be adversely affected 
if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance  it could adversely affect us 
in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses in order to protect against the risks we face 
for instance  we do not carry business interruption insurance 
we may elect not to carry insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  we cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks 
the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
while we intend to obtain and maintain insurance coverage we deem appropriate for these risks  there can be no assurance that our operations will not expose us to liabilities exceeding such insurance coverage or to liabilities not covered by insurance 

table of contents we are subject to complex federal  state  regional  local and other laws and regulations that could give rise to substantial liabilities from environmental contamination or otherwise adversely affect our cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
all facets of our operations are regulated extensively at the federal  state  regional and local levels 
in addition  a portion of our leases in uinta are  and some of our future leases may be  regulated by native american tribes 
environmental laws and regulations impose limitations on our discharge of pollutants into the environment  establish standards for our management  treatment  storage  transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and of solid and hazardous wastes  and impose on us obligations to investigate and remediate contamination in certain circumstances 
we also must satisfy  in some cases  federal and state requirements for providing environmental assessments  environmental impact studies and or plans of development before we commence exploration and production activities 
environmental and other requirements applicable to our operations generally have become more stringent in recent years  and compliance with those requirements more expensive 
frequently changing environmental and other governmental laws and regulations have increased our costs to plan  design  drill  install  operate and abandon oil and natural gas wells and other facilities  and may impose substantial liabilities if we fail to comply with such regulations or for any contamination resulting from our operations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may also result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
furthermore  our business  results from operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by any failure to comply with  or future changes to  these laws and regulations 
in addition  we could also be liable for the investigation or remediation of contamination  as well as other liabilities concerning hazardous materials or contamination such as claims for personal injury or property damage 
such liabilities may arise at many locations  including properties in which we have an ownership interest but no operational control  properties we formerly owned or operated and sites where our wastes have been treated or disposed of  as well as at properties that we currently own or operate  and may arise even where the contamination does not result from any noncompliance with applicable environmental laws 
under a number of environmental laws  such liabilities may also be joint and several  meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of the liability involved  or even the entire share 
we have incurred expenses and penalties in connection with remediation of contamination in the past  and we may do so in the future 
from time to time we have experienced accidental spills  leaks and other discharges of contaminants at some of our properties  as have other similarly situated oil and gas companies 
some of the properties that we have acquired  or in which we may hold an interest but not operational control  may have past or ongoing contamination for which we may be held responsible 
some of our operations are in environmentally sensitive areas that may provide habitat for endangered or threatened species  and other protected areas  and our operations in such areas must satisfy additional regulatory requirements 
moreover  public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years  and environmental organizations have opposed certain drilling projects and or access to prospective lands and have filed litigation to attempt to stop such projects  including decisions by the bureau of land management regarding several leases in utah that we have been awarded 
our activities are also subject to regulation by oil and natural gas producing states and one native american tribe of conservation practices and protection of correlative rights 
these regulations affect our operations and limit the quantity of oil and natural gas we may produce and sell 
a major risk inherent in our drilling plans is the need to obtain drilling permits from federal  state  local and native american tribal authorities 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or drilling permits  the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well  or the receipt of a permit with unreasonable conditions that are more expensive than we have anticipated could have a negative effect on our ability to explore or develop our properties 
additionally  the oil and natural gas regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase the financial and managerial costs to comply with the requirements of these laws and regulations and  consequently  adversely affect our profitability 
recent and future environmental regulations  including additional federal and state restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions that may be passed in response to climate change concerns  may increase our operating costs and also reduce the demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 
on september   california s governor signed into law the california global warming solutions act of assembly bill ab  which establishes a statewide cap on greenhouse gases ghg that will reduce the state s ghg emissions to levels by the california air resources board arb has been designated as the lead agency to establish and adopt regulations to implement ab by january  other state agencies are involved in this effort 
arb is working on mandatory reporting regulations and early action measures to reduce ghg emissions prior to the date 
a number of our personnel are involved in monitoring the establishment of these regulations through industry trade groups and other organizations in which we are a member 
similar laws and regulations may be adopted by other states in which we operate or by the federal government 
the oil and natural gas industry is a direct source of certain greenhouse gas emissions  such as carbon dioxide and methane  and future restrictions on such emissions could impact our future operations 
it is not possible  at this time  to estimate accurately how regulations to be adopted by arb or that may be adopted by others to address ghg emissions would impact our business 

table of contents property acquisitions are a component of our growth strategy  and our failure to complete future acquisitions successfully could reduce our earnings and slow our growth 
our business strategy has emphasized growth through strategic acquisitions  but we may not be able to continue to identify properties for acquisition or we may not be able to make acquisitions on terms that we consider economically acceptable 
there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry 
competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of  or cause us to refrain from  completing acquisitions 
our strategy of completing acquisitions is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and  in some cases  regulatory approvals 
if we are unable to achieve strategic acquisitions  our growth may be impaired  thus impacting earnings  cash from operations and reserves 
acquisitions are subject to the uncertainties of evaluating recoverable reserves and potential liabilities 
our recent growth is due in part to acquisitions of properties with additional development potential and properties with minimal production at acquisition but significant growth potential  and we expect acquisitions will continue to contribute to our future growth 
successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include recoverable reserves  exploration potential  future oil and natural gas prices  operating costs  production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
in connection with our assessments  we perform a review of the acquired properties  which we believe is generally consistent with industry practices 
however  such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems 
in addition  our review may not allow us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties  and we do not always discover structural  subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise 
our review prior to signing a definitive purchase agreement may be even more limited 
we generally are not entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities  including environmental liabilities  on acquisitions 
often  we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties 
if material breaches are discovered by us prior to closing  we could require adjustments to the purchase price or if the claims are significant  we or the seller may have a right to terminate the agreement 
we could also fail to discover breaches or defects prior to closing and incur significant unknown liabilities  including environmental liabilities  or experience losses due to title defects  for which we would have limited or no contractual remedies or insurance coverage 
there are risks in acquiring producing properties  including difficulties in integrating acquired properties into our business  additional liabilities and expenses associated with acquired properties  diversion of management attention  and costs of increased scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
increasing our reserve base through acquisitions is an important part of our business strategy 
any acquisition involves potential risks  including  among other things the validity of our assumptions about reserves  future production  the future prices of oil and natural gas  revenues and costs  including synergies  an inability to integrate successfully the properties and businesses we acquire  a decrease in our liquidity to the extent we use a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions  a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur debt to finance acquisitions  the assumption of unknown liabilities  losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  an inability to hire  train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business and assets  unforeseen difficulties encountered in operating in new geographic areas  and customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses 
our decision to acquire a property or business will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies  geophysical and geological analyses and seismic and other information  the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations 
also  our reviews of acquired properties are inherently incomplete because it generally is not feasible to perform an in depth review of the individual properties involved in each acquisition 
even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems  nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential problems 
inspections may not always be performed on every well  and environmental problems  such as ground water contamination  are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 

table of contents if third party pipelines interconnected to our natural gas wells and gathering facilities become partially or fully unavailable to transport our natural gas  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we depend upon third party pipelines that provide delivery options from our wells and gathering facilities 
since we do not own or operate these pipelines  their continuing operation in their current manner is not within our control 
if any of these third party pipelines become partially or fully unavailable to transport our natural gas  or if the gas quality specifications for their pipelines change so as to restrict our ability to deliver natural gas to those pipelines  our revenues and cash available for distribution could be adversely affected 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 
we depend to a large extent on the efforts and continued employment of our executive management team and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of these or other key personnel could adversely affect our business  and we do not maintain key man insurance on the lives of any of these persons 
our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists  engineers  landmen and other professionals 
competition for many of these professionals is intense 
if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel and professionals  our ability to compete could be harmed 
we may not adhere to our proposed drilling schedule 
our final determination of whether to drill any scheduled or budgeted wells will depend on a number of factors  including results of our exploration efforts and the acquisition  review and analysis of our seismic data  if any  availability of sufficient capital resources to us and any other participants for the drilling of the prospects  approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiled  economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling  including prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas and the availability and prices of drilling rigs and crews  and availability of leases  license options  farm outs  other rights to explore and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects 
although we have identified or budgeted for numerous drilling prospects  we may not be able to lease or drill those prospects within our expected time frame  or at all 
in addition  our drilling schedule may vary from our expectations because of future uncertainties  rig availability and access to our drilling locations utilizing available roads 
we may incur losses as a result of title deficiencies 
we acquire from third parties  or directly from the mineral fee owners  working and revenue interests in the oil and natural gas leaseholds and estates upon which we will perform our exploration activities 
the existence of a material title deficiency can reduce the value or render a property worthless thus adversely affecting the results of our operations and financial condition 
title insurance covering mineral leaseholds is not always available and when available is not always obtained 
as is customary in our industry  we rely upon the judgment of staff and independent landmen who perform the field work of examining records in the appropriate governmental offices and abstract facilities before attempting to acquire or place under lease a specific mineral interest and or undertake drilling activities 
we  in some cases  perform curative work to correct deficiencies in the marketability of the title to us 
in cases involving title problems  the amount paid for affected oil and natural gas leases or estates can be generally lost  and a prospect can become undrillable
