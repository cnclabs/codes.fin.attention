goodwill impairment sonomed during the last six months of the fiscal year ended june  sonomed experienced a significant decrease in demand for its product offering 
the company believes that this decrease in volume is related to the global economic downturn and the effect it has had on the ability of sonomed s traditional customer base to add additional or upgraded capital equipment at this time 
these troubling economic conditions have also lead to increased sales discounts to sonomed s distributors in order to entice end users to purchase or to compete with toughening competition 
these uncertainties in the market along with increased competition from existing competitors and emerging technologies have made it difficult for sonomed to project future revenue and cash flow 
the effect these conditions had on fiscal s actual performance as compared to budgeted performance was significant with actual profitability approximately lower than anticipated 
the company believes that these negative sales and profitability trends will continue for the foreseeable future and thus will have a significant negative effect on sonomed s estimated future operating results and cash flow 
sonomed reduced its work force by during the fourth quarter of the year ended june  in response to these uncertainties 
sonomed believes that these events negatively affected the evaluation of the future operating results and cash flows of sonomed 
the company tests goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
the first step of the sfas no 
impairment analysis consists of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting segment with its carrying amount  including the goodwill 
the fair value was determined based on the income approach  which estimates the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows 
under the income approach  the company assumed  with respect to sonomed  a forecasted cash flow period of five years  long term annual growth rates of and a discount rate of 
based on the annual income approach analysis that was separately performed for each operating segment  it was determined that in the sonomed segment the carrying amount of the goodwill was in excess of its respective fair value 
as such  the company was required to perform the second step analysis for sonomed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment 
the second step analysis consisted of comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill  with an impairment charge resulting from any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
based on the second step analysis  the company concluded that all  of the goodwill recorded at sonomed was impaired 
as a result  the company recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge to operations totaling  for the year ended june  the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill is necessary involves significant judgment based on short term and long term projections of the company 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows of the reporting segment  including profit margins  long term forecasts  discount rates and terminal growth rates  reflect the company s best estimates 
goodwill impairment drew drew encountered a series of events during the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year ended june  that had a material effect on the valuation of our goodwill related to the purchase of drew 
these events include a development delay of drew s ds instrument that drew had previously anticipated would be completed by the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending june   and a contract dispute with point care technologies pct that has delayed the development of drew s ht hiv instrument see footnote commitments and contingencies in the notes to the financial statements in the company s form k annual report for the fiscal year ended june  
the development of drew s proposed new diabetes instrument  the ds  is indefinitely delayed because of difficulties related to the final phase of its development 
the ds is intended as drew s next generation diabetes instrument  which is a key line of business for drew 
the uncertainty of the ds s completion combined with the continued aging of drew s existing diabetes instrument offerings has had a negative impact on drew s estimated future operating results and cash flow 
drew  in consultation with independent consultants  continues to evaluate the development status of the ds project 
until the evaluation is completed  drew cannot estimate the timing of the k application submission for the instrument to the fda or whether the submission will be made 
also  drew had anticipated that the joint development project it had undertaken with pct of drew s ht hiv instrument would be completed during the fiscal year ended june  in december drew settled a contract dispute with pct relating to this project see footnote commitments and contingencies in the company s form k annual report for the fiscal year ended june  for details on the dispute 
as part of the settlement  dated november  drew and pct are no longer jointly developing the ht hiv instrument  and drew is unable to estimate when or if the ht hiv instrument will be completed 
drew undertook the development effort at considerable cost because it believed that the ht hiv instrument had significant potential in monitoring the status of hiv patients 
the uncertainty whether the ht hiv will be completed has had a negative impact on drew s estimated future operating results and cash flow 
because of these developments and the continued diminished operating results of drew s aging legacy projects  the company reduced its work force during the fourth quarter of the year ended june  by positions and restructured certain management responsibilities

in order to continue to be listed on the nasdaq capital market  the following requirements must be met shareholders equity of  or market value of listed securities of  or net income from continuing operations in the latest fiscal year or two of the last three fiscal years of  publicly held shares   market value of publicly held shares  a minimum bid price of  round lot shareholders  two market makers  and compliance with corporate governance standards 
as of june   escalon complied with these requirements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact amounts reported therein 
the most significant of those involve the application of statement of accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  discussed further in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and  as such  include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management 
for example  estimates are used in determining valuation allowances for deferred income taxes  uncollectible receivables  obsolete inventory  sales returns and rebates warranty liabilities and purchased intangible assets 
actual results achieved in the future could differ from current estimates 
the company used what it believes are reasonable assumptions and  where applicable  established valuation techniques in making its estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products at the time of shipment  when title and risk of loss transfer 
the company provides products to its distributors at agreed wholesale prices and to the balance of its customers at set retail prices 
distributors can receive discounts for accepting high volume shipments 
the discounts are reflected immediately in the net invoice price  which is the basis for revenue recognition 
no further material discounts are given 
the company s considerations for recognizing revenue upon shipment of product to a distributor are based on the following persuasive evidence that an arrangement purchase order and sales invoice exists between a willing buyer distributor and the company that outlines the terms of the sale company information  quantity of goods  purchase price and payment terms 
the buyer distributor does not have a right of return 
shipping terms are ex factory shipping point 
at this point the buyer distributor takes title to the goods and is responsible for all risks and rewards of ownership  including insuring the goods as necessary 
the company s price to the buyer distributor is fixed and determinable as specifically outlined on the sales invoice 
the sales arrangement does not have customer cancellation or termination clauses 
the buyer distributor places a purchase order with the company  the terms of the sale are cash  cod or credit 
customer credit is determined based on the company s policies and procedures related to the buyer s distributor s creditworthiness 
based on this determination  the company believes that collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company assesses collectibility based on creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and does not require collateral from its customers 
for many of the company s international customers  the company requires an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
valuation of intangible assets the company annually evaluates for impairment its intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  see footnote to consolidated financial statements included in this form k for details on a goodwill impairment charge related to the carrying amount of sonomed and drew s goodwill 
these intangible assets include goodwill  trademarks and trade names 
factors the company considers important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if these criteria indicate that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
income loss per share the company computes net income loss per share under the provisions of sfas no 
 earnings per share  sfas and staff accounting bulletin  no 
sab 
under the provisions of sfas and sab  basic and diluted net income loss per share is computed by dividing the net income loss for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period 
the calculation of diluted net income loss per share excludes potential common shares if the impact is anti dilutive 
basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings per share are determined in the same manner as basic earnings per share  except that the number of shares is increased by assuming exercise of dilutive stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method 
taxes estimates of taxable income of the various legal entities and jurisdictions are used in the tax rate calculation 
management uses judgment in estimating what the company s income will be for the year 
since judgment is involved  there is a risk that the tax rate may significantly increase or decrease in any period 
in determining income loss for financial statement purposes  management must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
sfas accounting for income taxes also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the available evidence  it is more likely that not that all or some portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in evaluating the company s ability to recover the company s deferred tax assets  management considers all available positive and negative evidence including the company s past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses and near term forecasts of future taxable income that is consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to manage the underlying businesses 
through june   the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the company s net operating losses due to uncertainty of their realization as a result of the company s earnings history  the number of years the company s net operating losses and tax credits can be carried forward  the existence of taxable temporary differences and near term earnings expectations 
the amount of the valuation allowance could decrease if facts and circumstances change that materially increase taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards 
any reduction would reduce increase the income tax expense benefit in the period such determination is made by the company 
the company has adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which provides a comprehensive model for the recognition  measurement  and disclosure in financial statements of uncertain income tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
under fin  a company can recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not greater than that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination  based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
otherwise  no benefit can be recognized 
the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
additionally  companies are required to accrue interest and related penalties  if applicable  on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws 
the company has elected to recognize interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of its provision for income taxes 
stock based compensation effective july   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards r sfas r share based payments 
sfas r is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes abp opinion no 
the company used the modified prospective transition method and therefore did not have to restate results for prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  july   based on the grant date fair value estimate in accordance with the original provisions of sfas stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after july  is based on the grant date fair value estimate in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the company will recognize these compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
valuations are based on highly subjective assumptions about the future  including stock price volatility and exercise patterns 
the fair value of share based payment awards was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
the company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee terminations 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with apb no 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas including the treatment of contingent consideration  contingencies  acquisition costs  in process research and development and restructuring costs 
in addition  under sfas r  changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties in a business combination after the measurement period will impact income tax expense 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early application is not permitted 
the effect of sfas r on our consolidated financial statements will be dependent on the nature and terms of any business combinations that we consummate on or after july  in december  the fasb issued sfas no
