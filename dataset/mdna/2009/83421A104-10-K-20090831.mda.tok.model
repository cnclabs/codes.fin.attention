overview of the business we are the leading global provider of software and services to the automobile insurance claims processing industry 
we also provide products and services that complement our insurance claims processing software and services  including used vehicle validation and fraud detection software and services 
our automobile insurance claims processing customers include insurance companies  collision repair facilities  independent assessors and automotive recyclers 
we help our customers estimate the costs to repair damaged vehicles and determine pre collision fair market values for vehicles damaged beyond repair  automate and outsource steps of the claims process that insurance companies have historically performed internally  and improve their ability to monitor and manage their businesses through data reporting and analysis 
as of june   we served over  customers and were active in more than countries with approximately  employees 
our customers include more than  automobile insurance companies   collision repair facilities   independent assessors and  automotive recyclers and auto dealers 
we derive revenues from many of the world s largest automobile insurance companies  including each of the ten largest automobile insurance companies in europe and at least nine of the ten largest automobile insurance companies in north america 
segments we operate our business using two reportable segments emea and americas 
our emea segment consists of our operations in europe  the middle east  africa  asia and australia 
our americas segment consists of our operations in north  central and south america 
we do not allocate certain costs to reportable segments 
these costs are managed at the corporate level and include costs related to our financing activities 
the table below sets forth our revenues by operating segment and as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods indicated dollars in millions fiscal years ended june  emea americas total 
table of contents set forth below is our revenues from each of our principal customer categories and as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated dollars in millions fiscal years ended june  insurance companies collision repair facilities independent assessors automotive recyclers and others total for fiscal year  the united states  the netherlands and the united kingdom were the only countries that individually represented more than of total revenues 
the accounting policies for each of our segments are the same 
we evaluate the operating performance of our segments based primarily upon their respective revenues and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
we generally do not evaluate our costs and expenses on a segment basis 
components of revenues and expenses revenues we generate revenues from the sale of software and services to our customers pursuant to negotiated contracts or pricing agreements 
pricing for our software and services is set forth in these agreements and negotiated with each customer 
we generally bill our customers monthly under one or more of the following bases price per transaction fixed monthly amount for a prescribed number of transactions fixed monthly subscription rate price per set of services rendered price per system delivered our software and services are often sold as packages  without individual pricing for each component 
our revenues are reflected net of customer sales allowances  which we estimate based on both our examination of a subset of customer accounts and historical experience 
our core offering is our estimating and workflow software  which is used by our insurance company  collision repair facility and independent assessor customers and which represents the majority of our revenues 
our salvage and recycling software  business intelligence and consulting services  and other offerings represent in the aggregate a smaller portion of our revenues 
we believe that our estimating and workflow software will continue to represent a majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
cost of revenues excluding depreciation and amortization our costs and expenses applicable to revenues represent the total of operating expenses and systems development and programming costs  which are discussed below 
operating expenses our operating expenses include compensation and benefit costs for our operations  database development and customer service personnel  other costs related to operations  database development and customer support functions  third party data and royalty costs  and costs related to computer software and hardware used in the delivery of our software and services 

table of contents systems development and programming costs systems development and programming costs include compensation and benefit costs for our product development and product management personnel  other costs related to our product development and product management functions and costs related to external software consultants involved in systems development and programming activities

amortization includes amortization attributable to software purchases and software developed or obtained for internal use and our intangible assets  the majority of which were acquired in the csg acquisition 
interest expense interest expense consists primarily of payments of interest on our credit facilities and amortization of related debt issuance costs 
other income expense  net other income expense  net consists of foreign exchange gains and losses on notes receivable and notes payable to affiliates  interest income and other miscellaneous income and expense 
minority interests in net income of consolidated subsidiaries several of our customers own minority interests in five of our local operating subsidiaries 
minority interests in net income of consolidated subsidiaries reflect such customers proportionate interest in the earnings of such operating subsidiaries 
income tax provision benefit prior to our corporate reorganization in may  we were a limited liability company and  therefore  we were not subject to entity level federal income taxation 
however  even as a limited liability company  we incurred income taxes on our operations as they were held by taxable entities in the us and in foreign jurisdictions 
historical financial statements for our predecessor  which was a subchapter c corporation for federal income tax purposes  are based on corporate tax rates for the periods presented 
prior to our corporate reorganization  our income taxes were payable by our equity holders at rates applicable to them 
following our conversion to a subchapter c corporation  transactions recorded by us are subject to federal income taxation 
income taxes have been provided for all items included in the statements of income loss included herein  regardless of when such items were reported for tax purposes or when the taxes were actually paid or refunded 

table of contents factors affecting our operating results below is a summary description of several external factors that have or may have an effect on our operating results 
foreign currency 
during fiscal years  and  we generated approximately  and of our revenues  respectively  and incurred a majority of our costs  in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency risks 
in our historical financial statements  we re measure our local currency financial results in us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period 
these re measurements resulted in foreign currency translation adjustments of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  which are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
foreign currency transaction gains losses recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
during fiscal year  the us dollar strengthened significantly versus most major foreign currencies we use to transact our business 
for example  one euro was equal to approximately on june   on september   on december   on march  and on june  the change from june  to june  represents a strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro of approximately 
the strengthening of the us dollar had a negative comparable impact on our revenues  but a positive comparable impact on our expenses for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year factors that affect business volume 
the following external factors have or may have an effect on the number of claims that are submitted and or our volume of transactions  any of which can affect our revenues automobile usage number of miles driven 
fewer miles driven can result in fewer automobile accidents  which can reduce the transaction based fees that we generate 
in fiscal year  the number of miles driven in the united states and several of our large western european markets declined due to higher gasoline prices and difficult economic conditions 
number of insurance claims made 
in fiscal year  the number of insurance claims for vehicle damage submitted by owners to their insurance carriers has declined slightly in several of our markets  including some of our large western european markets 
while we do not know whether the decline in the number of claims made is a result of fewer accidents  other factors  such as vehicle owners reluctance to pay the insurance policy deductible for vehicle repair  or a combination of factors  fewer claims made can reduce the transaction based fees that we generate 
sales of new and used vehicles 
fewer new vehicle sales can result in fewer insured vehicles on the road and fewer automobile accidents  which can reduce the transaction based fees that we generate 
in fiscal year  the number of new vehicles sold in the united states and most of our large western european markets declined due to higher gasoline prices and difficult economic conditions 
used vehicle retail and wholesale values 
declines in retail and wholesale used vehicle values can impact vehicle owner and insurance carrier decisions about which damaged vehicles should be repaired and which should be declared a total loss 
the lower the retail and wholesale used vehicle values  the more likely it is that a greater percentage of automobiles are declared a total loss versus a partial loss 
the fewer number of vehicles that owners and insurance carriers decide to repair can reduce the transaction based fees that we generate for partial loss estimates  but may have a beneficial impact on the transaction based fees that we generate for total loss estimates 
damaged vehicle repair costs 
the cost to repair damaged vehicles  also known as severity  includes labor  parts and other related costs 
severity has steadily risen for a number of years 
according to the insurance resource council  the average severity per damaged vehicle in the united states rose by from to more recently  the us department of labor reported that the cost of motor vehicle body work for january rose by compared to january insurance companies 
table of contents purchase our products and services to help standardize the cost of repair 
should the cost of labor  parts and other related items continue to increase over time  insurance companies may seek to purchase and utilize an increasing number of our products and services to help improve the standardization of the cost of repair 
penetration rate of vehicle insurance 
an increasing rate of procuring vehicle insurance will result in an increase in the number of insurance claims made for damaged vehicles 
an increasing number of insurance claims submitted can increase the transaction based fees that we generate for partial loss and total loss estimates 
the rate of vehicle insurance is increasing in many of our less mature international markets 
this is due in part to both increased regulation and increased use of financing in the purchase of new and used vehicles 
we expect that the rate of vehicle insurance in our less mature international markets will continue to increase during the next eighteen months 
seasonality 
our business is subject to seasonal and other fluctuations 
in particular  we have historically experienced higher revenues during the second quarter and third quarter versus the first quarter and fourth quarter during each fiscal year 
this seasonality is caused primarily by more days of inclement weather during the second quarter and third quarter in most of our markets  which contributes to a greater number of vehicle accidents and damage during these periods 
in addition  our business is subject to fluctuations caused by other factors  including the occurrence of extraordinary weather events and the timing of certain public holidays 
for example  the easter holiday occurs during the third quarter in certain fiscal years and occurs during the fourth quarter in other fiscal years  resulting in a change in the number of business days during the quarter in which the holiday occurs 
non cash charges 
we incurred pre tax  non cash share based compensation charges of million  million and million  respectively  during fiscal years  and we expect to recognize additional pre tax  non cash share based compensation charges related to share based awards outstanding at june  aggregating approximately million ratably over the remaining weighted average vesting period of years 
in fiscal year  we incurred an additional pre tax  non cash charge of approximately million on the early extinguishment of debt associated with the completion of our initial public offering and the refinancing of debt 
this relates primarily to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and a prepayment premium on our second lien credit facility and our subordinated unsecured credit facility 
restructuring charges 
we have incurred restructuring charges in each period presented and also expect to incur additional restructuring charges  primarily relating to severance costs  over the next several quarters as we work to improve efficiencies in our business 
these charges  consisting primarily of termination benefits  will reduce our cash balances 
we do not expect reduced revenues or an increase in other expenses as a result of continued implementation of our restructuring initiatives 
other factors 
other factors that have or may have an effect on our operating results include gain and loss of customers  pricing pressures  acquisitions  joint ventures or similar transactions  expenses to develop new software or services  expenses and restrictions related to indebtedness 
we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations in recent years

we continually evaluate our operating costs in order to identify inefficiencies and eliminate unnecessary costs 
we anticipate that  although our operating expenses will continue to increase  they will decline as a percentage of revenues in future years

depreciation and amortization fiscal year vs 
fiscal year and fiscal year vs 
fiscal year in fiscal year  depreciation and amortization decreased by million primarily due to lower intangibles amortization expense resulting from the csg acquisition  offset by the intangibles amortization expense resulting from the businesses we acquired in fiscal year  including hpi  and a strengthening of the us dollar versus certain foreign currencies in which we transact business which reduced depreciation and amortization which caused million of the decrease 
in fiscal year  depreciation and amortization decreased by million primarily due to lower intangibles amortization expense resulting from the csg acquisition 
we generally amortize intangible assets on an accelerated basis to reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are realized 
although we expect to experience significant depreciation and amortization in the future as we amortize intangible assets resulting from the csg acquisition and our fiscal year acquisitions  we anticipate that the amount of total depreciation and amortization expense will continue to decline over the next several years  subject to the effect of any future acquisitions 
restructuring charges fiscal year vs 
fiscal year and fiscal year vs

in fiscal year  other income expense  net decreased million which was primarily due to the million loss on debt extinguishment we incurred as a result of the may refinancing transactions 
income tax provision fiscal year vs 
fiscal year and fiscal year vs 
fiscal year in fiscal year  we recorded an income tax provision of million  which resulted in an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year was attributable to the establishment of a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets in fiscal year which caused an increase in our fiscal year income tax provision 
the effective tax rate is reduced by the benefit attributable to foreign income taxed at lower rates and tax credits generated during the year 
in fiscal year  we recorded an income tax provision of million  which resulted in an effective tax rate of 
the increase in effective tax rate in fiscal year was attributable to our establishment of a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets based on analysis of all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
the effective tax rate is reduced by the benefit attributable to foreign income taxed at lower rates and tax credits generated during the year 
factors that impact our income tax provision include but are not limited to the mix of jurisdictional earnings  establishment of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions  and varying jurisdictional income tax rates that are applied 
changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate 
there have been recent public reports regarding proposed significant changes to the us international tax laws  including changes that would limit us tax deductions for expenses related to un repatriated foreign source income and modify the us foreign tax credit  that  if enacted  could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of cash have included cash generated from operations  proceeds from our may initial public offering and our november secondary public stock offering  and borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities 
our principal uses of cash have included business combinations  debt service  capital expenditures and working capital 
we expect that these will remain our principal uses of cash in the future 
in may  we entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit facility  which provides us with the following borrowing commitments a million revolving credit facility  a million us term loan and a million european term loan 
as of june   we had million and million million in outstanding loans under the us term loan and european term loan  respectively  with interest rates of and  respectively 
no borrowings were outstanding under the revolving credit facility at june  
table of contents the amended and restated senior secured credit facility contains a leverage ratio  which is applicable only to the revolving loans and applies only if at least million of revolving loans  net of outstanding letters of credit  are outstanding for at least days during the prior fiscal quarter 
in addition  the amended and restated senior secured credit facility contains covenants restricting us from undertaking specified corporate actions  including asset dispositions  acquisitions  payment of dividends and other specified payments  changes of control  incurrence of indebtedness  creation of liens  making loans and investments and transactions with affiliates 
as of june  and  we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million and million  respectively 
we believe that our existing unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under our amended and restated senior credit facilities will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital  planned capital spending and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we regularly review acquisition and other strategic opportunities  which may require additional debt or equity financing 
we currently do not have any material pending agreements with respect to any other acquisition or strategic opportunity 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  further dilution to our then existing stockholders may result 
additional debt financing may include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends 
any equity or debt financing may contain terms  such as liquidation and other preferences that are not favorable to us or our stockholders 
on august   we announced that our board of directors approved the payment of a quarterly cash dividend of per share outstanding of common stock and per outstanding restricted stock unit payable on september  to stockholders and restricted stock unit holders of record at the close of business on september  any determination to pay dividends in future periods will be at the discretion of our board of directors 
the following summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash in the periods presented amount changed from fiscal years ended june  to to in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
the million increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year was primarily the result of an increase in net income partially offset by a decrease in the non cash adjustments  such as depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes and the change in the fair value of derivative financial instruments  to reconcile net income to cash  and by the changes in operating assets and liabilities 
investing activities 
the million increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal year included an increase in capital expenditures of million  purchases of million of short term investments in fiscal year  and million of cash used in our fiscal year acquisitions  including our acquisition of hpi 
financing activities 
the million increase in cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year was primarily due to the net proceeds from our november secondary public stock offering of million and a million decrease in repayments of long term debt as a result of voluntary debt principal payments in fiscal year 
table of contents contractual obligations the following table reflects our cash contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations purchase obligations lease obligations total represents principal and interest payments for our senior secured credit facilities and the note payable issued in connection with our acquisition of hpi  as well as payments on our interest rate swaps 
for purposes of the table above  we calculated the interest payments on our senior secured credit facilities assuming that the interest rate in effect on the senior secured credit facilities at june  would remain fixed through maturity 
lease obligations include operating and capital leases and are net of sublease income 
in addition to the contractual obligations identified in the preceding table  the minority shareholders of certain of our majority owned subsidiaries have the right to put their minority shares to us at a purchase price equal to the then fair value of the shares 
as of june   we estimated that the aggregate fair value of these redeemable minority interests was approximately million 
we also have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million as of june  the timing of the future cash flows related to this liability are highly uncertain 
off balance sheet arrangements and related party transactions as of june   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
certain minority stockholders of our international subsidiaries are also commercial purchasers and users of our software and services 
revenue transactions with all of the individual minority stockholders in the aggregate represent approximately of our consolidated revenue for fiscal year and aggregate accounts receivable from the minority stockholders represent approximately of consolidated accounts receivable at june  the corresponding amounts for fiscal years and were less than

we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 

table of contents goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually at a reporting unit level using a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units through an income approach  utilizing a discounted cash flow model  and a market approach  which considers comparable companies and transactions 
under the income approach  the discounted cash flow model determines fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period 
both values are discounted to reflect the degree of risk inherent in an investment in the reporting unit and achieving the projected cash flows 
a weighted average cost of capital of a market participant is used as the discount rate 
the residual value is generally determined by applying a constant terminal growth rate to the estimated net cash flows at the end of the projection period 
alternatively  the present value of the residual value may be determined by applying a market multiple at the end of the projection period 
under the market approach  fair value is determined based on multiples of revenues and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for each reporting unit 
the multiples were determined based on a selection of comparable companies and acquisition transactions  discounted for each reporting unit to reflect the relative size  diversification and risk of the reporting unit in comparison to the indexed companies and transactions 
we test indefinite lived intangible assets at the unit of accounting level by making a determination of the fair value of the intangible asset 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we also evaluate the remaining useful life of our intangible assets that are not subject to amortization on an annual basis to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if an intangible asset that is not being amortized is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life  that asset is tested for impairment 
after recognition of the impairment  if any  the asset is amortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 
we primarily determine fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets under an income approach that utilizes a discounted cash flow model 
as of june  and  we had goodwill of million and million  respectively  and indefinite lived intangible assets of million and  respectively 
long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite lives and property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used  the loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant negative industry or economic trends or the presence of other factors that would indicate that the carrying amount of an 
table of contents asset or asset group is not recoverable 
a long lived asset is considered to be impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset 
revenue recognition 
we recognize and present revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab topic  revenue recognition  american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended  sfas no 
 accounting for leases  emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  eitf issue no 
 application of aicpa statement of position no 
to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
accordingly  revenues are recognized only after services are provided  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and when collectability is probable 
our multiple element arrangements primarily include a combination of software licenses  hosted database and other services  installation and set up services  hardware  maintenance services and transaction based deliverables 
we generate a significant majority of our revenue from subscription based contracts where a monthly fee is charged  transaction based contracts where a fee per transaction is charged and subscription based contracts with additional transaction based fees where a monthly fee and a fee per transaction are charged 
subscription based and transaction based contracts generally include the delivery of software  access to software through a hosted service hosted database  upfront fees for the implementation and set up activities necessary for the client to use access the software implementation services and maintenance 
under a subscription arrangement  delivery of software  access to the hosted database and maintenance are considered a single element or a combined unit of accounting and related revenues are recognized at the end of each month upon the completion of the monthly service 
revenues under transaction based contracts are recognized based on the guidance in aicpa technical practice aid no 
 fair value in multiple element arrangements that include contingent usage based fees and software revenue recognition 
the transaction based fee represents payment for the right to use the software  access to the hosted database and maintenance 
the fee is considered fixed and determinable only at the time actual usage occurs 
revenue is recognized based on actual usage 
implementation services are considered a separate element or unit of accounting and the related revenue recognition is described below 
subscription based contracts with additional fees for certain types of transactions generally include all deliverables discussed in the above paragraph and also include an additional element  which is the option to access specialized queries on the hosted database 
revenue under subscription based contracts with additional fees for certain types of transactions is accounted for based on the guidance in aicpa technical practice aid no 

under these arrangements  the delivery of software  access to software through the hosted database and maintenance are considered a combined unit of accounting  and the related fee is recognized at the end of each month upon the completion of the monthly service 
the transaction based fee is recognized at the time of actual usage 
implementation services are considered a separate element or unit of accounting and the related revenue recognition is described below 
when we are required to perform setup and implementation activities necessary for the client to receive services software  up front fees billed during the setup implementation phase are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated customer life 
the upfront fees represent fair value of the implementation services based on vendor specific objective evidence 
the amortization of this deferred revenue will commence upon the start of the monthly service 
setup costs that are direct and incremental to the contract are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated customer life 
in a limited number of our revenue arrangements  we also provide generic computer equipment as part of the sales arrangement 
based on guidance in eitf issue no 
 applicability of sop no 
 software 
table of contents revenue recognition  to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software  the generic computer equipment is considered a non software deliverable since our software is not essential to the functionality of the generic computer equipment 
we account for the sale of generic equipment as a direct finance lease 
the related revenue is recognized over the term of the contract using the effective interest rate method 
we allocate revenue to the elements of these arrangements on a relative fair value basis using our best estimate of the fair value of the elements 
revenue from leased computer equipment represents approximately of our consolidated revenue 
revenues are reflected net of customer sales allowances  which are based on both specific identification of certain accounts and a predetermined percentage of revenue based on historical experience 
stock based compensation 
effective july   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payments  sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options  restricted stock units and restricted share awards  based on estimated fair values recognized over the requisite service period 
prior to adoption of sfas no 
r  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we accounted for employee share awards under accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and followed the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
we estimate the fair value on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain input variables  as follows expected volatility 
volatility is a measure of the amount the stock price will fluctuate during the expected life of an award 
we determine the expected volatility based on a combination of implied market volatilities  historical volatility of our stock price and other factors 
risk free interest rate 
our assumption of the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on us constant rate treasury securities in effect at the time of the grant with remaining terms equivalent to the respective expected terms of the share based award 
expected dividend yield 
because we have not paid any cash dividends since our inception  we have historically assumed a dividend yield of zero 
expected award life 
because we have a limited history of stock option exercises  we determine the expected award life using the simplified method described in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payments 
under sfas no 
r  we are also required to estimate at the grant date the likelihood that the award will ultimately vest the pre vesting forfeiture rate  and revise the estimate  if necessary  in future periods if the actual forfeiture rate differs 
we determine the pre vesting forfeiture rate of an award based on industry and employee turnover data as well as an historical pre vesting forfeitures occurring over the previous year 
under the true up provisions of sfas no 
r  we recognize additional share based compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than estimated and a recovery of previously recognized share based compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than estimated 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expenses or benefits are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
we also account for any uncertain income tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on 
table of contents provisions of currently enacted tax laws 
the effects of future enactments of changes in tax laws or rates are not contemplated 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax payments are probable 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
this may occur for a variety of reasons  such as the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a particular tax return or the signing of a final settlement agreement with the respective tax authority 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes and tax contingencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing for tax returns for such periods 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences  or reversing book tax differences  resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realizable and to the extent we believe that realizability does not meet the more likely than not standard  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include a tax expense or benefit within the tax provision in the statement of operations unless a current year valuation allowance is allocated to an item of equity 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowances  which could impact our results of operations in the quarter in which such determination is made 
at june   we had our gross deferred tax assets of approximately million  including million of net operating losses generated in the us and result primarily from interest expense under our debt agreements 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
as a result of our analysis of all available evidence as of june   it was concluded that it was not more likely than not that our deferred tax assets  primarily in the us  would be realized and  accordingly  we have maintained a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the amount of million 
derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments are used principally in the management of foreign currency and interest rate exposures and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transactions occur and affect earnings 
ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings 
derivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked to market at the end of each accounting period with the results included in results of operations 
our derivative financial instruments at june  consisted entirely of interest rate swaps 
these interest rate swaps were designated and documented at their inception as cash flow hedges and are evaluated for effectiveness quarterly 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income in stockholders equity and reclassified into earnings when the 
table of contents hedged transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of these cash flow hedges is recognized in interest expense 
we estimate the fair value of our interest rate swaps using industry standard valuation techniques to extrapolate future reset rates from period end yield curves and standard valuation models based on the black scholes option valuation model 
market based observable inputs including spot and forward rates  volatilities and interest rate curves at observable intervals are used as inputs to the models

at the march  eitf meeting  the sec observer announced revisions to topic no 
d  classification and measurement of redeemable securities  which provides sec registrants with guidance on the financial statement classification and measurement of equity securities that are subject to mandatory redemption requirements or whose redemption is outside the control of the issuer 
the revised topic no 
d requires minority interests that are redeemable at the option of the holder to be recorded outside of permanent equity at fair value  and the redeemable minority interests to be adjusted to their fair value at each balance sheet date 
adjustments to the carrying amount of a noncontrolling interest from the application of topic no 
d are recorded to retained earnings or additional paid in capital in the absence of retained earnings 
we will adopt the revised provisions of topic no 
d in the first quarter of fiscal year related to our redeemable minority interest 
upon adoption of the revised provisions of topic no 
d  we will adjust the carrying value of our redeemable minority interests to fair value with a corresponding adjustment to stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet 
had we adopted the revised provisions of topic no 
d as of june   we would have recorded an approximately million increase to redeemable minority interest with a corresponding decrease to stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet 
we estimate our redeemable minority interests have an aggregate fair value of approximately million at june  we determined the fair value of our redeemable minority interests using a discounted cash flow model utilizing significant unobservable inputs  which are level inputs under sfas no

r  business combinations 
sfas no 
r requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date to be measured at their fair value as of that date 
an acquirer is required to recognize assets or liabilities arising from all other contingencies as of the acquisition date  measured at their acquisition date fair values  only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of an asset or a liability 
any acquisition related costs are to be expensed instead of capitalized 
additionally  restructuring expenses generally must be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period impact income tax expense 
sfas no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations  if any  for which the acquisition date is on or after july  the impact on our consolidated 
table of contents financial statements from the adoption of sfas no 
r in fiscal year will depend on our acquisition activity during the reporting period 
had we adopted sfas no 
r effective at the beginning of fiscal year  million of capitalized acquisition related expenses related to our fiscal year acquisitions would have been recognized as a charge against our fiscal year earnings and we would have recognized a liability at the acquisition date for the estimated fair value of contingent purchase consideration expected to be paid in the future 
additionally  any acquisition related expenses incurred in fiscal year in relation to potential acquisitions which were not consummated by june  were charged against our fiscal year earnings 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under sfas no 
 fair value measurements would be disclosed separately by level within the fair value hierarchy 
our adoption of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we conduct operations in many countries around the world 
our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction risk and currency translation risk 
we incur currency transaction risk when we enter into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency other than our functional currency  which is the us dollar 
with respect to currency translation risk  our financial condition and results of operations are measured and recorded in the relevant domestic currency and then translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
exchange rates between these currencies and us dollars have fluctuated significantly over the last few years and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
a substantial portion of our revenues and costs are denominated in or effectively indexed to us dollars  but the majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in euros  pound sterling  swiss francs  canadian dollars and other international currencies 
during fiscal year  the us dollar has strengthened significantly versus most major foreign currencies we use to transact our business 
for example  one euro was equal to approximately on june   on september   on december   on march  and on june  the change from june  to june  represents a strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro of approximately 
the strengthening of the us dollar had a negative comparable impact on our revenues  but a positive comparable impact on our expenses for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year a hypothetical increase or decrease in the us dollar versus other currencies in which we transact our business would have resulted in a million change to our revenues during fiscal year in february  we entered into a foreign exchange option that gave us the right to call million in us dollars at a strike price of per us dollar at any time up to february  we paid approximately million for this option 
in november  we sold the foreign exchange option for million 
historically  other than the foreign currency option described above  we have not undertaken hedging strategies to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and financial condition  however  we may decide to do so in the future 

table of contents interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through borrowings under our revolving loan arrangement and term loans 
interest on these borrowings is based upon variable interest rates 
our weighted average borrowings outstanding and the weighted average interest rate under the revolving loan arrangement and term loans during fiscal year were million and 
based on the foregoing  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a million change to our interest expense for fiscal year in june  we entered into three us dollar based interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million  million million as of june  per the planned reduction in notional amounts over the life of the swap contract  and million  each with maturities on june   which require us to pay fixed rates of   and  respectively 
we also entered into three euro based interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million million as of june  per the planned reduction in notional amounts over the life of the swap contract  million  and million  each with maturities as late as june   which require us to pay fixed rates of   and  respectively 
these interest rate swaps are designated and documented at their inception as cash flow hedges and are evaluated for effectiveness quarterly 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of these cash flow hedges is recognized in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the estimated fair values of the us dollar based swaps were liabilities of million and million at june  and  respectively  which were included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the estimated fair values of the euro based swaps were a liability of million million and an asset of million million at june  and  respectively  which were included in other noncurrent liabilities and other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
the change of million in the fair value of swaps  net of tax  reflects the effective portion of loss on these hedges and is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity
