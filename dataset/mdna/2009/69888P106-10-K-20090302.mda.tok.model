item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with par s consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview the introduction of new manufactured and distributed products at selling prices that generate adequate gross margins is critical to our growth 
on october   par announced a resizing of its generic products division as part of an ongoing strategic assessment of its businesses 
this initiative is intended to enable par to optimize its current generic product portfolio and its pipeline of first to file first to market products 
as a result  par believes it will be better positioned to compete in the generic marketplace over the long term 
par has begun to significantly reduce its research and development expenses by decreasing its internal research and development activities in an effort to focus on completing products currently in development 
also  par will continue seeking additional products for sale through new and existing distribution agreements or acquisitions of complementary products and businesses  additional first to file opportunities and unique dosage forms to differentiate its products in the marketplace 
par pays a percentage of the gross profits or sales to its strategic partners on sales of products covered by its distribution agreements 
generally  products that par had developed internally  and to which it is not required to split any profits with strategic partners  contribute higher gross margins than products covered by distribution agreements 
sales and gross margins of our products depend principally on the i introduction of other generic drug manufacturers products in direct competition with par s significant products  ii ability of generic competitors to quickly enter the market after patent or exclusivity period expirations  or during exclusivity periods with authorized generic products  diminishing the amount and duration of significant profits to par from any one product  iii pricing practices of competitors and the removal of competing products from the market  iv continuation of existing distribution agreements  v introduction of new distributed products  vi consolidation among distribution outlets through mergers  acquisitions and the formation of buying groups  vii willingness of generic drug customers  including wholesale and retail customers  to switch among generic pharmaceutical manufacturers  viii approval of andas  introduction of new par manufactured products  and future new product launches  ix granting of potential marketing exclusivity periods  x extent of market penetration for the existing product line  xi level  quality and amount of customer service  and xii market acceptance of par s recently introduced branded product and the successful development to commercialization of our in licensed branded product pipeline 
net sales and gross margins derived from generic pharmaceutical products often follow a pattern based on regulatory and competitive factors that are believed by management to be unique to the generic pharmaceutical industry 
as the patent s for a brand name product and the related exclusivity period s expire  the first generic manufacturer to receive regulatory approval from the fda for a generic equivalent of the product is often able to capture a substantial share of the market 
at that time  however  the branded company may license an authorized generic product to a competing generic company 
as additional generic manufacturers receive regulatory approvals for competing products  the market share and the price of that product have typically declined  often significantly  depending on several factors  including the number of competitors  the price of the brand product and the pricing strategy of the new competitors 
generic business during the year ended december   par s generic business net revenues and gross margin were concentrated in a few products  including two product launches 
in the third quarter of  par launched dronabinol in mg  mg and mg strengths in soft gel capsules 
we have the right to market  sell and distribute dronabinol in the united states 
par will share net product margin  as contractually defined  on future sales of dronabinol with svc pharma lp  an affiliate of rhodes technologies 
par also commenced shipment of meclizine hcl tablets in mg and mg strengths in the third quarter of as of december   we believe par is the exclusive supplier of the ab rated generic product 
par marketed meclizine prior to an explosion at the facility of its api supplier in february we have since qualified a new api source and received the appropriate approval of our new drug application to manufacture and market meclizine utilizing our new supplier 
in november  par launched generic versions of imitrex sumatriptan injection mg and mg starter kits and mg and mg prefilled syringe cartridges pursuant to a supply and distribution agreement with glaxosmithkline plc gsk 
on may   par announced an amendment to its agreement with spectrum pharmaceuticals and paid spectrum million pursuant to which we increased our share of the profits from to for the commercialization of the generic versions of gsk s imitrex sumatriptan injection 
the total cost of this intangible asset related to this product was million  of which a net asset of million remains at december  the useful life of this intangible asset is three years 
amortization is estimated based on expected cash flows of sumatriptan over its useful life 
new product launches in included propranolol hcl extended release capsules  a product resulting from our strategic partnership with nortec development associates  inc  and ranitidine hcl syrup  pursuant to a supply and distribution agreement with gsk in the first quarter and the launch of metoprolol succinate er mg in the fourth quarter of and additional strengths mg  mg  and mg in the third quarter  pursuant to a supply and distribution agreement with astrazeneca 
in addition  our investments in generic development is expected to yield approximately eleven new product launches during and based on one or more of the following expiry of the relevant month stay period  patent expiry date  expiry of regulatory exclusivity 
however  such dates may change due to various circumstances  including extended litigation  outstanding citizens petitions  other regulatory requirements set forth by the fda  and stays of litigation 
these launches will be significant mileposts for par as many of these products are first to file opportunities with gross margins in excess of our current portfolio 
strativa for strativa  we will continue to invest in the marketing and sales of our promoted products and prepare for the commercialization of our licensed products 
in addition  par will continue to seek new licenses and acquisitions that accelerate the growth of its branded business 
par anticipates these efforts and the three potential new product filings for strativa noted below will contribute to its goal of generating annualized brand total revenue in excess of million by the end of in july  par received fda approval for its first new drug application nda  filed pursuant to section b of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  and immediately began marketing megestrol acetate oral suspension nanocrystal dispersion megace es 
megace es is indicated for the treatment of anorexia  cachexia or any unexplained significant weight loss in patients with a diagnosis of aids and is utilizing the megace brand name that the company has licensed from bristol myers squibb company 
the net book value of the trademark was million at december  and it has an estimated remaining useful life of approximately years 
we have promoted megace es as its primary brand product and generated prescription growth from launch through net sales growth tempered in principally due to the reimbursement environment for megace es that became more challenging and included a change in reimbursement status that was implemented by a major medicare part d plan 
in september  par entered into an extended reach agreement with solvay pharmaceuticals  inc that provides for our branded sales force to co promote androgel  as well as future versions of the product or other products that are mutually agreed upon  for a period of six years 
as compensation for its marketing and sales efforts  we will receive up to million annually  paid quarterly  for the six year period 
on january   the ftc filed a lawsuit against the company in the us district court for the district of central california alleging violations of antitrust laws stemming from par s court approved settlement in the patent litigation with solvay pharmaceuticals 
par believes it has complied with all applicable laws in connection with the court approved settlement and intends to vigorously defend this action 
in july  we acquired an exclusive licensing agreement under which the company will receive commercialization rights in the us to bioalliance pharma s loramyc miconazole lauriad  an antifungal therapy for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis  an opportunistic infection commonly found in immunocompromised patients  including those with hiv and cancer 
phase iii studies have been completed by bioalliance  and bioalliance submitted a nda for loramyc on february  and is awaiting a response from the fda indicating whether the nda has been accepted for filing by the fda  a process which could take up to days 
in august  we also acquired the north american commercial rights to zensana tm ondansetron hcl oral spray from hana biosciences  inc ondansetron is used to prevent nausea and vomiting after chemotherapy  radiation and surgery 
assuming successful development and approval  zensana tm could be among the first in its class of ht antagonist anti emetic therapies to be available in an oral spray form 
par and its development partner in this program  novadel  are collaborating in the reformulation of zensana tm 
in  bioequivalence to the reference drug was achieved in certain studies and not achieved in others 
we are working with novadel to further evaluate the results in order to determine the next steps for the zensana tm program 
in june  we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with monosol under which the company acquired the commercialization rights in the united states to monosol s thin film formulation of ondansetron 
ondansetron thin film formulation is a new oral formulation in development for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting  prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy  and post operative nausea and vomiting 
bioequivalency studies were initiated in by monosol 
two studies were completed in in this program that demonstrated bioequivalence to the reference drug 
in the first quarter of  monosol completed final ondansetron thin film bioequivalence reports indicating successful completion of all clinical studies necessary to file the nda for the product with the fda including meeting all applicable clinical endpoints necessary for the approval of the nda for the product  thereby triggering our payment to monosol of a million milestone  which will be charged to research and development expense 
it is anticipated that strativa could file a nda with the fda within the next twelve months 
in january  par announced that it entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with alfacell corporation alfacell to acquire the commercialization rights in the united states for onconase ranpirnase  then in development for the treatment of unresectable malignant mesothelioma 
in may  alfacell reported that the preliminary data from its phase iii clinical trial  which assessed treatment with onconase plus doxorubicin compared to treatment with doxorubicin alone  did not meet statistical significance for the primary endpoint of overall survival in unresectable malignant mesothelioma 
however  based on the preliminary data from the phase iii study  statistically significant results were achieved in the subset of evaluable unresectable malignant mesothelioma patients who failed a prior chemotherapy regimen before entering this clinical trial 
this subset of patients achieved a statistically significant increase in overall survival when treated with onconase plus doxorubicin compared to treatment with doxorubicin alone 
on january   alfacell reported that it has conducted a pre nda meeting with the fda to discuss its planned submission of the final components of the onconase rolling new drug application for the treatment of unresectable malignant mesothelioma patients 
at the pre nda meeting  the fda provided guidance to alfacell recommending that an additional clinical trial be conducted in unresectable malignant mesothelioma patients that have failed one prior chemotherapy regimen  prior to submitting a nda 
alfacell s current financial situation does not allow it to pursue an additional clinical trial  prior to submitting a nda until other sources of capital are secured 
alfacell intends to continue to explore strategic alternatives and additional capital 
under our agreement  the next milestone payment to alfacell is payable upon approval of onconase by the fda for unresectable malignant mesothelioma 
par does not have an obligation to provide alfacell with any additional funding to conduct the fda required additional clinical trial 
related party alfacell lawrence a 
kenyon became executive vice president  finance of par effective as of december   and will assume the role of executive vice president and chief financial officer of par as of march  mr 
kenyon recently served as executive vice president  chief financial officer  and corporate secretary from january  and chief operating officer since november  of alfacell corporation 
mr 
kenyon has been a member of the board of directors of alfacell since november and will continue to serve as a member of the alfacell board 
through february   mr 
kenyon acted as president  chief financial officer and corporate secretary of alfacell 
other considerations in addition to the substantial costs of product development  par may incur significant legal costs in bringing certain products to market 
litigation concerning patents and proprietary rights is often protracted and expensive 
pharmaceutical companies with patented brand products are increasingly suing companies that produce generic forms of their patented brand name products for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights  which could delay or prevent the entry of such generic products into the market 
generally  a generic drug may not be marketed until the applicable patent s on the brand name drug expires 
when an anda is filed with the fda for approval of a generic drug  the filing person may certify either that the patent listed by the fda as covering the branded product is about to expire  in which case the anda will not become effective until the expiration of such patent  or that the patent listed as covering the branded drug is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture  sale or use of the new drug for which the anda is filed 
in either case  there is a risk that a branded pharmaceutical company may sue the filing person for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
because a substantial portion of our current business involves the marketing and development of generic versions of brand products  the threat of litigation  the outcome of which is inherently uncertain  is always present 
such litigation is often costly and time consuming  and could result in a substantial delay in  or prevent  the introduction and or marketing of products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  prospects and results of operations 
sales and gross margins of our products depend principally on the i introduction of other generic drug manufacturers products in direct competition with par s significant products  ii ability of generic competitors to quickly enter the market after patent or exclusivity period expirations  or during exclusivity periods with authorized generic products  diminishing the amount and duration of significant profits to par from any one product  iii pricing practices of competitors and the removal of competing products from the market  iv continuation of existing distribution agreements  v introduction of new distributed products  vi consolidation among distribution outlets through mergers  acquisitions and the formation of buying groups  vii willingness of generic drug customers  including wholesale and retail customers  to switch among generic pharmaceutical manufacturers  viii approval of andas  introduction of new manufactured products  and future new product launches  ix granting of potential marketing exclusivity periods  x extent of market penetration for the existing product line  xi level  quality and amount of customer service  and xii market acceptance of our recently introduced branded product and the successful development to commercialization of our in licensed branded product pipeline 
par divested finetech effective december  and  as such  its results are being reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented see notes to consolidated financial statements note discontinued operations related party transaction 
the following table shows the revenues  gross margin  and operating income and loss by segment for the years ended december    and amounts in thousands revenues generic strativa total revenues gross margin generic strativa total gross margin operating loss income generic strativa total operating loss income total revenue dollars decreased  thousand  or for the year ended december  as compared to and gross margin dollars decreased  thousand  or  for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december   par s total revenues dollars increased  thousand  or when compared to and gross margin dollars increased  thousand  or when compared to generic revenue dollars decreased  thousand  or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in decreased generic revenues in were primarily due to pricing pressure on existing products including fluticasone  propranolol hcl er caps  cabergoline  various amoxicillin products  tramadol hcl and acetaminophen tablets and ranitidine hcl syrup 
this was coupled with discontinuation of polyethylene glycol  and lower royalty payments driven primarily by ondansetron tablets 
these decreases were partially offset by higher sales resulting from meclizine  which launched in july  the launch of the mg  mg  and mg strengths of dronabinol in july  the launch of sumatriptan succinate in november and increased sales of metoprolol succinate er 
generic gross margin dollars decreased  thousand  or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease in generic gross margin was primarily due to lower sales of fluticasone  propranolol hcl er caps  cabergoline  tramadol hcl and acetaminophen tablets  various amoxicillin products  and ranitidine hcl syrup 
these decreases were coupled with an impairment charge on nabumetone in the third quarter  greater pricing pressure on other base products  and lower royalty payments driven primarily by ondansetron tablets 
these decreases were partially offset by the relaunch of meclizine  the launches of dronabinol and sumatriptan  increased sales of metoprolol and lower inventory write offs 
generic revenue dollars increased  thousand  or for the year ended december  from the year ended december  generic gross margin dollars increased  thousand  or for the year ended december  from the year ended december  the increase in generic gross margin was primarily due to new product launches including propranolol hcl er and metoprolol succinate er  royalties earned from the sales of ondansetron tablets  which launched in the fourth quarter of  and lower inventory write offs for the year ended december  compared with the same period in strativa revenue dollars increased  thousand or for the year ended december  and gross margin dollars increased  thousand or for the year ended december  driven by increased sales of megace es and fees received related to the co promotion of androgel 
for the year ended december   strativa revenues dollars increased  thousand or and gross margin dollars increased  thousand or driven by increased sales of megace es and full year fees received related to the co promotion of androgel 
net sales and gross margins derived from generic pharmaceutical products often follow a pattern based on regulatory and competitive factors that are believed by management to be unique to the generic pharmaceutical industry 
as the patent s for a brand name product and the related exclusivity period s expire  the first generic manufacturer to receive regulatory approval from the fda for a generic equivalent of the product is often able to capture a substantial share of the market 
at that time  however  the branded company may license an authorized generic product to a competing generic company 
as additional generic manufacturers receive regulatory approvals for competing products  the market share and the price of that product have typically declined  often significantly  depending on several factors  including the number of competitors  the price of the brand product and the pricing strategy of the new competitors 
par s operating loss in was mainly due to the decrease in gross margins for the generic segment as discussed above 
also  par recorded a  thousand loss owed to pentech with respect to an unfavorable court decision  and a loss contingency of approximately  thousand in connection with its department of veterans affairs contract  which represents its estimate of the loss related to an expected settlement of this matter  including interest 
par also recorded restructuring costs of million during see below for details of the restructuring costs 
the legal fees incurred by par increased by approximately million in as compared to gains on sales of product rights and other decreased approximately million in these negative factors included in the operating loss were tempered by lower strativa in licensing payments in million  lower other r d expenditures million  lower employee compensation driven by lower bonus costs million  the non recurrence of the fourth quarter stock option tender offer and the resulting lower stock option costs million  lower expenses related to sales and marketing of megace es million  decreased professional accounting fees due to the non recurrence of par s restatement of prior periods million  and lower product liability insurance premiums million 
operating income from the generic business was impacted in by the sales and gross margins discussed above  including a reduction in inventory write offs of million driven by improved inventory management and the non recurrence of the write off of pre launch inventories million related to the delayed launch of clonidine  as well as by increased investment in generic research and development projects million  and costs associated with par s tender offer for certain eligible unvested stock options million  partially offset by the non recurrence of the write off of invalid customer deductions million 
brand operating loss was favorably impacted in due to higher gross margin on higher sales  the co promotion fees for androgel approximately million  the sale of par million and the cancellation of the development programs for par and the megace es oncology clinical program approximately million  tempered by higher costs incurred in connection with the in license of several late stage compounds in support of par s strategy to expand its strativa segment million and the costs of par s tender offer for certain eligible unvested stock options million 
results of operations revenues total revenues of par s top selling products were as follows amounts in thousands product generic metoprolol succinate er toprol xl fluticasone flonase meclizine hydrochloride antivert cabergoline dostinex sumatriptan succinate injection imitrex propranolol hcl er inderal la various amoxicillin products amoxil dronabinol marinol ibuprofen rx motrin megestrol oral suspension megace methimazole tapazole fluoxetine prozac lovastatin mevacor tramadol hcl and acetaminophen tablets ultracet ranitidine hcl syrup zantac quinapril accupril cefprozil cefzil other product related revenues other total generic revenues strativa megace es other other product related revenues total strativa revenues the further detailing of annual revenues of the other approximately generic drugs is impracticable due to the low volume of revenues associated with each of these generic products 
no single product in the other category is in excess of of total generic revenues for any year in the three year period ended december  other product related revenues represents licensing and royalty related revenues from profit sharing agreements related to products such as nifedipine er  the generic version of procardia  doxycycline monohydrate  the generic version of adoxa  ondansetron odt  the generic version of zofran odt  and quinapril  the generic version of accupril 
other product related revenues included in the strativa segment relate to a co promotion arrangement with solvay 
on january   the ftc filed a lawsuit against the company in the us district court for the district of central california alleging violations of antitrust laws stemming from par s court approved settlement in the patent litigation with solvay pharmaceuticals 
par believes it has complied with all applicable laws in connection with the court approved settlement and intends to vigorously defend this action 
total revenues for the year ended december  were  thousand  decreasing  thousand  or  from total revenues of  thousand for the year ended december  revenues for generic products for the year ended december  were  thousand  decreasing  thousand  or from revenues for generic products of  thousand for the year ended december  among the top selling products in that did not have sales in were dronabinol and sumatriptan succinate 
lower generic revenues in were primarily driven by lower sales of certain existing products driven by increased competition affecting both price and volume  including fluticasone  which decreased  thousand  propranolol hcl er caps  which decreased  thousand  tramadol hcl and acetaminophen tablets  which decreased by  thousand  cabergoline  which decreased  thousand  various amoxicillin products  which decreased by  thousand  ranitidine hcl syrup  which decreased  thousand  and ibuprofen  which decreased  thousand 
in addition  par experienced declines in many of par s other products due to volume and pricing pressures  and polyethylene glycol  which decreased  thousand due to product discontinuation as well as lower royalties  which decreased  thousand primarily from lower sales of ondansetron 
these decreases were partially offset by higher sales of metoprolol succinate er  which increased  thousand resulting from increased volume due to full year impact of mg  mg and mg strengths  meclizine  which increased  thousand resulting from the relaunch in july and the new product launches described above 
net sales of distributed products  which consist of products manufactured under contract and licensed products  were approximately of par s total revenues in and approximately of par s total revenues in the increase in the percentage is driven by the launch of dronabinol and sumatriptan and increased sales of metoprolol partially offset by lower sales of fluticasone and higher sales of meclizine  which is a manufactured product 
par is substantially dependent upon distributed products for its overall sales  and any inability by its suppliers to meet demand could adversely affect par s future sales 
revenues for the strativa segment were  thousand for the year ended december   increasing  thousand  or  from strativa revenues of  thousand for the year ended december  the strativa revenue growth in is principally driven by price increases  timing of trade buying patterns and fees received related to the co promotion of androgel 
these increases were offset by a more challenging reimbursement environment and included a change in reimbursement status that was implemented by a major medicare part d plan 
total revenues for the year ended december  were  thousand  increasing  thousand  or  from total revenues of  thousand for the year ended december  revenues for generic products for the year ended december  were  thousand  increasing  thousand  or from revenues from generic products of  thousand for the year ended december   due primarily to the introduction of new products 
among the top selling products in that did not have sales in was metoprolol succinate er mg  mg  and mg  propranolol hcl er caps  and ranitidine hcl syrup 
among the top selling products in that were introduced in the fourth quarter of was metoprolol succinate er mg  which increased by  thousand 
partially offsetting these increases were lower sales in of certain existing products  including fluticasone  which decreased  thousand  various amoxicillin products  which decreased by  thousand  quinapril  which decreased by  thousand  cefprozil  which decreased  thousand  tramadol hcl and acetaminophen tablets  which decreased by  thousand  lovastatin  which decreased  thousand and paroxetine  which decreased  thousand from increased competition adversely affected both the volume and pricing on the above existing products 
net sales of distributed products  which consist of products manufactured under contract and licensed products  were approximately of par s total revenues in and approximately of par s total revenues in revenues for par s brand segment were  thousand for the year ended december   increasing  thousand  or  from brand revenues of  thousand for the year ended december  the increase in is driven by increased sales of megace es and fees received related to the co promotion of androgel 
gross revenues to total revenues deductions generic drug pricing at the wholesale level can create significant differences between the invoice price and par s net selling price 
wholesale customers purchase product from par at invoice price  then resell the product to specific healthcare providers on the basis of prices negotiated between par and the providers  and the wholesaler submits a chargeback credit to par for the difference 
par records estimates for these chargebacks  sales returns  rebates and incentive programs  and other sales allowances  for all its customers at the time of sale  as reductions to gross revenues  with corresponding adjustments to its accounts receivable reserves and allowances 
as detailed above  par has the experience and the access to relevant information that it believes are necessary to reasonably estimate the amounts of such deductions from gross revenues 
some of the assumptions used by par for certain of its estimates are based on information received from third parties  such as wholesale customer inventory data and market data  or other market factors beyond par s control 
the estimates that are most critical to the establishment of these reserves  and therefore would have the largest impact if these estimates were not accurate  are estimates related to expected contract sales volumes  average contract pricing  customer inventories and return levels 
par regularly reviews the information related to these estimates and adjusts its reserves accordingly if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates 
with the exception of the product returns allowance  the ending balances of account receivable reserves and allowances generally are eliminated during a two to four month period  on average 
par recognizes revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred to its customers and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
this is generally at the time that products are received by the customers 
upon recognizing revenue from a sale  par records estimates for chargebacks  rebates and incentives  returns  cash discounts and other sales reserves that reduce accounts receivable 
par s gross revenues before deductions for chargebacks  rebates and incentive programs including rebates paid under federal and state government medicaid drug reimbursement programs  sales returns and other sales allowances were as follows  december  december  december  millions millions millions gross revenues chargebacks rebates and incentive programs returns cash discounts and other medicaid rebates and rebates due under other us government pricing programs total deductions total revenues the total gross to net sales adjustments as a percentage of gross sales increased to in compared to in  primarily due to increased pricing pressure of keys products including metoprolol succinate er  fluticasone  and cabergoline 
this increase was tempered by the relaunch of meclizine in july  the launches of dronabinol in july and sumatriptan succinate in november  lower royalty income in  lower returns and lower rebates primarily driven by lower fluticasone sales  customer net pricing trends and lower formulary sales 
the total gross to net sales adjustments as a percentage of gross sales decreased to in compared to in  primarily due to less competition for new products  mainly fluticasone and cabergoline  and reductions of wholesale invoice prices on certain of par s existing products 
gross to net deductions are discussed in critical accounting policies and use of estimates section below 
gross margin par s gross margin of  thousand of total revenues in the year ended december  decreased  thousand from  thousand of total revenues in the year ended december  generic product gross margins of  thousand of generic revenues in the year ended december  decreased  thousand from  thousand of generic revenues in primarily due to lower sales of existing products including fluticasone  propranolol hcl er  and cabergoline  a decline in many of par s other products due to pricing pressures  an impairment charge of approximately million for nabumetone driven by an increased competitive environment and expected lower future cash flows coupled with par s routine evaluation of its generic product portfolio  and lower royalties driven by lower sales of ondansetron 
these decreases were partially offset by higher sales of metoprolol succinate  meclizine driven by the relaunch in july  dronabinol launched in july and sumatriptan succinate launched in november as well as lower inventory write offs 
the strativa gross margin of  thousand of branded revenues for the year ended december  increased by  thousand from  thousand of branded revenues for the year ended december  due to revenue growth discussed above 
the rate of gross margin as a percentage of net product sales in reflects increased sales of lower margin metoprolol succinate er  increased amortization driven by the nabumetone impairment charge and lower royalty income and lower sales of higher margin products such as cabergoline and propranolol hcl er  offset by the increased sales of higher margin meclizine and megace es  the launches of higher margin dronabinol and sumatriptan succinate  lower sales of low margin products such as fluticasone and lower inventory write offs 
par s gross margin of  thousand of total revenues in the year ended december  increased  thousand from  thousand of total revenues in the year ended december  generic product gross margins of  thousand of generic revenues in the year ended december  increased  thousand from  thousand of generic revenues in primarily due to the introduction of new product launches including propranolol hcl er and metoprolol succinate er  royalties earned from the sales of ondansetron tablets  which launched in the fourth quarter of  and lower inventory write offs  thousand 
gross margin from strativa products was  thousand of branded revenues for the year ended december  increased by  thousand from  thousand of branded revenues for the year ended december  due to higher sales of megace es and co promotion fees for selling androgel 
the rate of gross margin as a percentage of net product sales in reflects the launch of higher margin propranolol hc er  lower inventory write offs of finished product  lower sales of lower margin existing products including fluticasone and lovastatin  increased sales of higher margin megace es  the co promotion fee for androgel  and royalties earned from the sales of ondansetron tablets  which launched in the fourth quarter  tempered by the launch of lower margin metoprolol succinate er 
operating expenses stock option tender offer in november  par issued a tender offer to repurchase eligible stock options held by employees in exchange for a one time cash payment in the range of to per option 
eligible employee held options were unvested stock options with exercise prices in excess of per share 
the tender offer was completed in december with approximately thousand stock options cash settled and resulted in million of additional share based compensation expense in the fourth quarter of  that otherwise would have been recognized ratably in and  of which million was charged to selling  general and administrative expense  million was charged to research and development expense  and million was charged to costs of goods sold 
research and development par s research and development expenses of  thousand of total revenues for the year ended december  decreased  thousand or from  thousand of total revenues from the year ended december   driven by a reduction in expenditures related to both the strativa and generic research and development expenditures 
expenditures related to strativa were down approximately million  which was principally driven by a net reduction of million of one time strativa milestone payments  as million of payments to alfacell and monosol rx  detailed below  were more than offset by the non recurrence of million of payments incurred in to acquire rights to late stage compounds  comprised of loramyc  pafuramidine maleate and zensana tm 
the development of pafuramidine maleate was discontinued in february in january  par entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with alfacell corporation to acquire the commercialization rights to onconase in the united states 
under the terms of the agreement  par made an initial cash payment of million to alfacell in the first quarter of refer to subsequent events below for an update on this development program 
in june  par entered into an exclusive licensing agreement under which it acquired the commercialization rights in the united states to the thin film formulation of ondansetron from monosol rx 
ondansetron thin film formulation is a new oral formulation in development for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting  prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy  and post operative nausea and vomiting 
under the terms of the agreement  par made an initial cash payment to monosol in the second quarter of of million and an additional million in the third quarter of upon successful completion of the first contractual milestone 
refer to subsequent events below for an update on this development program 
in addition to these milestones  on going r d expense in support of par s strategy to expand strativa increased approximately million driven by costs related to the development of zensana tm 
expenditures related to par s generic portfolio decreased million due to a reduction of personnel cost of million  primarily due to the non recurrence of performance incentive compensation incurred in and the non recurrence of one time costs associated with a third party development agreement million and other lower internal development costs million 
par s research and development expenses of  thousand of total revenues for the year ended december  increased  thousand or from  thousand of total revenues from the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to costs incurred in support of par s strategy to expand its brand segment  principally the in license of three compounds in late stage development 
in june  par executed an exclusive licensing agreement with immtech for the us commercial rights to parfuramidine maleate for the treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia in aids patients 
par paid immtech million upon the execution of this agreement 
as discussed above the parfuramidine program was discontinued in february in july  par acquired the us commercialization rights from bioalliance pharma to loramyc micronazole lauriad  an innovative antifungal therapy for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis  an opportunistic infection commonly found in immunocompromised patients  including those with hiv and cancer 
par paid bioalliance million upon the execution of the agreement 
in august  par acquired the north american commercial rights from hana biosciences  inc to zensana tm ondansetron hcl oral spray  which is used to prevent nausea and vomiting after chemotherapy  radiation and surgery 
under the terms of this agreement  par made a million equity investment in hana at a contractually agreed premium to the prevailing market price 
of this amount  million  representing the premium paid  was charged to research and development expense in in addition to these up front costs  par incurred an additional million in outside development costs related to these products 
these increases were tempered by million relating to the termination of the megace es clinical development program for oncology  and million relating to the first quarter termination of par in support of its generic segment  par entered into an agreement with intellipharmaceutics ltd ipc  a privately held corporation  in august  to develop and market a number of controlled release generic drug products 
under the terms of this agreement  par made a million private placement equity investment  of which million was charged to research and development expense in  based on the estimated fair value of the investment in ipc

critical accounting policies and use of estimates critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the portrayal of par s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
par s most critical accounting policies  as discussed below  pertain to revenue recognition and the determination of deductions from gross revenues  the determination of whether certain costs pertaining to par s significant development and marketing agreements are to be capitalized or expensed as incurred  the valuation and assessment of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and inventory valuation 
in applying such policies  management often must use amounts that are based on its informed judgments and estimates 
because of the uncertainties inherent in these estimates  actual results could differ from the estimates used in applying the critical accounting policies 
par is not aware of any likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect its financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition and provisions for deductions from gross revenues par recognizes revenues for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred to its customers  when reliable estimates of rebates  chargebacks  returns and other adjustments can be made  and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
this is generally at the time products are received by the customers 
upon recognizing revenue from sales  par records estimates for the following items that reduce gross revenues chargebacks rebates and incentive programs product returns cash discounts and other medicaid rebates the following table summarizes the activity for the years ended december   and in the accounts affected by the estimated provisions described below  in thousands for the year ended december  accounts receivable reserves beginning balance provision recorded for current period sales provision reversal recorded for prior period sales credits processed ending balance chargebacks rebates and incentive programs returns cash discounts and other total accrued liabilities for the year ended december  accounts receivable reserves beginning balance provision recorded for current period sales provision reversal recorded for prior period sales credits processed ending balance chargebacks rebates and incentive programs returns cash discounts and other total accrued liabilities for the year ended december  accounts receivable reserves beginning balance provision recorded for current period sales provision reversal recorded for prior period sales credits processed ending balance chargebacks rebates and incentive programs returns cash discounts and other total accrued liabilities unless specific in nature  the amount of provision or reversal of reserves related to prior periods for chargebacks is not determinable on a product or customer specific basis  however  based upon historical analysis and analysis of activity in subsequent periods  par has determined that its chargeback estimates remain reasonable 
includes amounts due to customers for which no underlying accounts receivable exists and is principally comprised of medicaid rebates and rebates due under other us government pricing programs 
par included additional amounts that were part of accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of december  thousand and december  thousand in the tables above that are similar to the previously disclosed amounts due to customers for which no underlying accounts receivable exists 
the changes in accounts receivable reserves recorded for prior period sales related to rebates and incentives programs are principally comprised of the finalization of contract negotiations with a certain customer s that resulted in an adjustment of  thousand to our rebates and incentive programs for sales made to that customer in the fourth quarter of with the exception of the foregoing factor  there were no other factors that were deemed to be material individually or in the aggregate 
the changes in accounts receivable reserves recorded for prior period sales related to returns principally comprised of the successful resolution in the twelve month period ended december  of a customer dispute over invalid customer deductions taken in prior periods of  thousand  and an update to management s prior period returns estimates relating to the loss of a customer for certain products and new returns information that became available during the twelve month period ended december   of  thousand 
the changes in accounts receivable reserves recorded for prior period sales related to returns principally comprised of specific return of products triggered by the loss of customers based upon competitive pricing pressures that resulted in an adjustment to previous sales of  and the concession of a customer dispute related to invalid deductions for returns that resulted in an adjustment to previous sales par sells its products directly to wholesalers  retail drug store chains  drug distributors  mail order pharmacies and other direct purchasers and customers that purchase its products indirectly through the wholesalers  including independent pharmacies  non warehousing retail drug store chains  managed health care providers and other indirect purchasers 
par has entered into agreements at negotiated contract prices with those health care providers that purchase products through par s wholesale customers at those contract prices 
chargeback credits are issued to wholesalers for the difference between par s invoice price to the wholesaler and the contract price through which the product is resold to health care providers 
approximately of our net product sales were derived from the wholesale distribution channel for the year ended december  and of our net product sales were derived from the wholesale distribution channel for the year ended december  the information that par considers when establishing its chargeback reserves includes contract and non contract sales trends  average historical contract pricing  actual price changes  processing time lags and customer inventory information from its three largest wholesale customers 
par s chargeback provision and related reserve vary with changes in product mix  changes in customer pricing and changes to estimated wholesaler inventory 
customer rebates and incentive programs are generally provided to customers as an incentive for the customers to continue carrying par s products or replace competing products in their distribution channels with products sold by par 
rebate programs are based on a customer s dollar purchases made during an applicable monthly  quarterly or annual period 
par also provides indirect rebates  which are rebates paid to indirect customers that have purchased par s products from a wholesaler under a contract with par 
the incentive programs include stocking or trade show promotions where additional discounts may be given on a new product or certain existing products as an added incentive to stock par s products 
par may  from time to time  also provide price and or volume incentives on new products that have multiple competitors and or on existing products that confront new competition in order to attempt to secure or maintain a certain market share 
the information that par considers when establishing its rebate and incentive program reserves are rebate agreements with and purchases by each customer  tracking and analysis of promotional offers  projected annual sales for customers with annual incentive programs  actual rebates and incentive payments made  processing time lags  and for indirect rebates  the level of inventory in the distribution channel that will be subject to indirect rebates 
par does not provide incentives designed to increase shipments to its customers that it believes would result in out of the ordinary course of business inventory for them 
par regularly reviews and monitors estimated or actual customer inventory information at its three largest wholesale customers for its key products to ascertain whether customer inventories are in excess of ordinary course of business levels 
pursuant to a drug rebate agreement with the centers for medicare and medicaid services  tricare and similar supplemental agreements with various states  par provides such states with a rebate on drugs dispensed under government programs 
par determines its estimate of medicaid rebate accrual primarily based on historical experience of claims submitted by the various states and any new information regarding changes in the medicaid program that might impact par s provision for medicaid rebates 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount par considers historical payment rates  processing lag for outstanding claims and payments  and levels of inventory in the distribution channel 
par reviews the accrual and assumptions on a quarterly basis against actual claims data to help ensure that the estimates made are reliable 
on january   the fiscal year national defense authorization act was enacted  which expands tricare to include prescription drugs dispensed by tricare retail network pharmacies 
tricare rebate accruals reflect this program expansion and are based on actual and estimated rebates on department of defense eligible sales 
par accepts returns of product according to the following criteria i the product returns must be approved by authorized personnel with the lot number and expiration date accompanying any request and ii par generally will accept returns of products from any customer and will provide the customer with a credit memo for such returns if such products are returned within six months prior to  and until months following  such products expiration date 
par records a provision for product returns based on historical experience  including actual rate of expired and damaged in transit returns  average remaining shelf lives of products sold  which generally range from to months  and estimated return dates 
additionally par considers other factors when estimating its current period return provision  including levels of inventory in the distribution channel  significant market changes that may impact future expected returns  and actual product returns  and may record additional provisions for specific returns that it believes are not covered by the historical rates 
par offers cash discounts to its customers  generally of the sales price  as an incentive for paying within invoice terms  which generally range from to days 
par accounts for cash discounts by reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts that par expects its customers to take 
in addition to the significant gross to net sales adjustments described above  par periodically makes other sales adjustments 
par generally accounts for these other gross to net adjustments by establishing an accrual in the amount equal to its estimate of the adjustments attributable to the sale 
par may at its discretion provide price adjustments due to various competitive factors  through shelf stock adjustments on customers existing inventory levels 
there are circumstances under which par may not provide price adjustments to certain customers as a matter of business strategy  and consequently may lose future sales volume to competitors and risk a greater level of sales returns on products that remain in the customer s existing inventory 
as detailed above  par has the experience and access to relevant information that it believes are necessary to reasonably estimate the amounts of such deductions from gross revenues 
some of the assumptions used by par for certain of its estimates are based on information received from third parties  such as wholesale customer inventories and market data  or other market factors beyond par s control 
the estimates that are most critical to the establishment of these reserves  and therefore  would have the largest impact if these estimates were not accurate  are estimates related to contract sales volumes  average contract pricing  customer inventories and return volumes 
par regularly reviews the information related to these estimates and adjusts its reserves accordingly  if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates 
with the exception of the product returns allowance  the ending balances of accounts receivable reserves and allowances generally are processed during a two month to four month period 
use of estimates in reserves par believes that its reserves  allowances and accruals for items that are deducted from gross revenues are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
it is possible  however  that other parties applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different allowance and accrual amounts for items that are deducted from gross revenues 
additionally  changes in actual experience or changes in other qualitative factors could cause par s allowances and accruals to fluctuate  particularly with newly launched or acquired products 
par reviews the rates and amounts in its allowance and accrual estimates on a quarterly basis 
if future rates and amounts are significantly greater than those reflected in its recorded reserves  the resulting adjustments to those reserves would decrease par s reported net revenues  conversely  if actual product returns  rebates and chargebacks are significantly less than those reflected in its recorded reserves  then the resulting adjustments to those reserves would increase its reported net revenues 
if par were to change its assumptions and estimates  its reserves would change  which would impact the net revenues that par reports 
par regularly reviews the information related to these estimates and adjusts its reserves accordingly  if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates 
research and development agreements par capitalizes or expenses amounts related to the development of new products and technologies through agreements with third parties based on par s determination of its ability to recover in a reasonable period of time its cost from the estimated future cash flows anticipated to be generated pursuant to each agreement 
accordingly  amounts related to par s funding of the research and development efforts of others or to the purchase of contractual rights to products that have not been approved by the fda  and where par has no alternative future use for the product  are expensed and included in research and development costs 
amounts for contractual rights acquired by par to a process  product or other legal right having multiple or alternative future uses that support its realizability  as well as to an approved product  are capitalized and included in intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market value 
par establishes reserves for its inventory to reflect situations in which the cost of the inventory is not expected to be recovered 
in evaluating whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand  estimated time required to sell such inventory  remaining shelf life and current expected market conditions  including level of competition 
par records provisions for inventory to cost of goods sold 
par capitalizes costs associated with certain products prior to regulatory approval and product launch pre launch inventories when it is reasonably certain that the pre launch inventories will be saleable  based on management s judgment of future commercial use and net realizable value 
the determination to capitalize is made once par or its third party development partners has filed an abbreviated new drug application that has been acknowledged by the fda for containing sufficient information to allow the fda to conduct their review in an efficient and timely manner and management is reasonably certain that all regulatory and legal hurdles will be cleared 
this determination is based on the particular facts and circumstances relating to the expected fda approval of the generic drug product being considered  and accordingly  the time frame within which the determination is made varies from product to product 
par could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre launch inventories upon a change in such judgment  due to a denial or delay of approval by regulatory bodies  a delay in commercialization  or other potential risk factors 
if these risks were to materialize and the launch of such product were significantly delayed  par may have to write off all or a portion of such pre launch inventories and such amounts could be material 
as of december   par had pre launch inventories of million 
should any launch be delayed  inventory write offs may occur to the extent par is unable to recover the full value of its inventory investment 
the recoverability of the cost of pre launch inventories with a limited shelf life is evaluated based on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding the timing of anticipated product launches  including par s expected number of competitors during the six month period subsequent to any anticipated product launch 
further  par believes that the inventory balance at december  is recoverable based on anticipated launches and the related expected demand for lower priced generic products that may be substituted for referenced branded products upon fda approval 
goodwill and intangible assets par determines the estimated fair values of goodwill and certain intangible assets with definitive lives based on valuations performed by par at the time of their acquisition in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  the fair value of certain amounts paid to third parties related to the development of new products and technologies  as described above  are capitalized and included in intangible assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually  or when events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
intangible assets are reviewed quarterly  or when events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is determined to exist when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the net assets being tested 
impairment of definite lived intangibles is determined to exist when undiscounted cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the assets being tested 
as discussed above with respect to determining an asset s fair value  because this process involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis of the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded  these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates 
as of december   par determined through its estimates that no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets existed  except as disclosed 
par will continue to assess the carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
as discussed in notes to consolidated financial statements note intangible assets  par impaired intangible assets with net carrying values of million in as a result of the acquisition of kali in  par had amounts recorded as goodwill of  thousand at december  and december  in addition  intangible assets with definite lives  net of accumulated amortization  totaled  thousand at december  and  thousand at december recent accounting pronouncements that may have a material impact on future consolidated financial statements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb 
under the new rules for convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion  an entity should separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer s economic interest cost 
previous guidance provided for accounting of this type of convertible debt instruments entirely as debt 
par s senior subordinated convertible notes are subject to fsp apb upon conversion  par has agreed to satisfy its conversion obligation in cash in an amount equal to the principal amount of the notes converted 
the effect of the new rules for convertible debt instruments is that the equity component would be included in the additional paid in capital section of stockholders equity on par s consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the convertible debt instruments 
fsp apb will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years  with retrospective application required 
for instruments subject to the scope of fsp apb  higher interest expense will result through the accretion of the discounted carrying value of the convertible debt instruments to their face amount over their term 
prior period interest expense will also be higher than previously reported due to retrospective application 
early adoption is not permitted 
par estimates that its original million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes due will have an approximate initial measurement of a million liability component and a million equity component 
par estimates annual interest expense will be retroactively restated upward in a range between million to million for the years    and in the annual report on form k

eitf  accounting for collaborative arrangements 
the key elements of eitf relate to a the scope of the issue  b the income statement presentation of transactions with third parties  c the income statement presentation of payments between parties to the collaborative arrangement  d the disclosures about collaborative arrangements that should be required in the financial statements of the parties to the collaborative arrangements  and e the transition method 
a contractual arrangement falls within the scope of eitf if the arrangement requires the parties to be active participants and the arrangement exposes the parties to significant risks and rewards that are tied to the commercial success of the endeavor 
costs incurred and revenue generated on sales to third parties should be reported in the statement of operations based on the guidance in eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the equity method of accounting should not be applied to a collaborative arrangement within the scope of this issue without the creation of a separate legal entity for the arrangement 
payments between parties to the collaborative arrangement should be presented in the statement of operations based on the nature of the arrangement and each entity s business operations  the contractual terms of the arrangement as well as if existing gaap is applicable 
eitf requires companies to disclose the nature and purpose of the arrangement  its rights and obligations under the arrangement  the accounting policy applied to the arrangement  and the amounts attributable to transactions between other participants to the collaborative arrangement and where in the statement of operations these amounts have been classified 
eitf requires that companies comply in its first fiscal year beginning after december  and transition to the guidance in this issue by retrospectively applying the guidance to all periods presented for all arrangements existing at the effective date  unless it is impracticable to do so 
the impracticability assessment should be made on an arrangement by arrangement basis and certain disclosures would be required if a company utilized the impracticability exception 
par is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting eitf on its consolidated financial statements

revised sfas r  business combinations 
sfas r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations 
under sfas r  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
sfas r will change the accounting treatment for certain specific items  including  acquisition costs will be generally expensed as incurred  minority interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  acquired contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for non acquired contingencies  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
sfas r also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
par will be required to record and disclose business combinations following existing gaap until january  in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to gaap guidance requiring use of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements 
sfas applies to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards  except for measurements of share based payments and measurements that are similar to  but not intended to be  fair value 
the fasb has previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas was effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the effective date of sfas with regard to non financial assets and liabilities is january  for par 
par s adoption of sfas with respect to financial assets and liabilities as of january  did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements

eitf  accounting for non refundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  which requires nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities to be deferred and capitalized 
these amounts will be recognized as an expense in the period that the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed or when an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered 
eitf is effective for the fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years 
par s adoption of the provisions of eitf  beginning january  did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which became effective for fiscal periods beginning after november  under sfas  companies may elect to measure specified financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise measured at fair value  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each subsequent reporting period 
this election  called the fair value option  will enable some companies to reduce volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to draw a comparison between the different measurement attributes a company elects for similar types of assets and liabilities 
par did not elect the fair value option for any of its eligible financial assets or liabilities and therefore par s adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk available for sale debt securities the primary objectives for par s investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are made with the intention to achieve the best available rate of return on traditionally low risk investments 
par s investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings  the us government and us governmental agencies 
par is subject to market risk primarily from changes in the fair values of its investments in debt securities including governmental agency and municipal securities  and corporate bonds 
these instruments are classified as available for sale securities for financial reporting purposes 
a ten percent increase in interest rates on december  would have caused the fair value of par s investments in available for sale debt securities to decline by approximately million as of that date 
additional investments are made in overnight deposits and money market funds 
these instruments are classified as cash and cash equivalents for financial reporting purposes  generally also have lower interest rate risk relative to its investments in debt securities and changes in interest rates generally have little or no impact on their fair values 
for cash  cash equivalents and available for sale debt securities  a ten percent decrease in interest rates would decrease interest income earned by par by approximately million on an annual basis
