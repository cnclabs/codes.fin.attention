the market for pas is currently declining in china 
in february china s ministry of industry and information technology  or mii  requested carriers terminate their pas networking service by as the country adopts other cellular technologies 
in august  we began shipping our universal serial bus  or usb  solutions for wlan that were both developed internally and added through our acquisition of zydas 
zydas was a privately held  taiwan based integrated circuit design company specializing in high performance wlan semiconductor and software solutions 
in conjunction with the acquisition  zydas became the atheros taiwan development center 
the results of operations of zydas have been included in our consolidated statements of operations since the date of acquisition 
in december  we began shipping the ethernet solutions acquired from attansic for pc applications 
our ethernet solutions are integrated into pc lan on motherboards  or lom  by supplying gigabit ethernet network interface card  or nic  and physical layer  or phy  products for loms 
in  we introduced our first fast ethernet switch product and our first gigabit ethernet switch  both for wired and wireless local area networking solutions 
in  we introduced our first npu that incorporates our fast ethernet switch 
the results of operations for attansic have been included in our consolidated statements of operations since december during  we began sampling our first single chip  cmos bluetooth solutions  which support the bluetooth enhanced data rate standard and leverage our expertise in rf design and integration to deliver a highly compact  low power design for use in a variety of bluetooth enabled devices 
in  we began shipping our bluetooth products 
in december  we acquired certain of the assets and liabilities from u nav  a privately held fabless semiconductor company specializing in gps chipsets and software that enable mobile location based products and services 
in january  we began shipping the gps solutions acquired from u nav for personal navigation devices  or pnds 
the results of operations from the u nav acquisition have been included in our consolidated statements of operations since the date of acquisition 

table of contents worldwide economic conditions have recently deteriorated and we are currently operating in an economic recession 
as a result  the semiconductor industry in particular is currently experiencing a significant cyclical downturn 
such a downturn is characterized by decreases in product demand  excess customer inventories and accelerated erosion of prices 
during the fourth quarter of  we experienced cancellations  deferrals and a significant slowdown in orders 
our revenue declined sequentially from million in the third quarter of to million  and as a result we recorded a net loss for the fourth quarter of of million 
during the first quarter of  we expect our revenue will further decline from our fourth quarter levels  and we will incur a net loss 
we cannot predict the timing  strength or duration of this economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery 
if the economy does not improve or deteriorates further  it will adversely impact our revenue and operating profit and we may realize inventory excesses  reduced profitability and additional net losses 
revenue 
our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of wlan  pas  ethernet  bluetooth and gps chipsets and to a lesser extent  from licensed software and services 
our sales have historically been made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
original equipment manufacturers  or oems  utilize our chipsets in developing their wireless system solutions such as access points  routers  embedded laptop clients  handsets  cardbus  minicards  hand held video game devices and pnds 
some oems purchase chipsets directly from us and manufacture their products 
other oems utilize original design manufacturers  or odms  to design and build subsystem products that the oem then purchases from the odm and incorporates into the oem s system solution 
accordingly  we ship our products either directly to the oem or to the odm based on the requirements of each oem 
purchase orders are received from an oem or an odm and we generally recognize revenue based on the shipment of chipsets to this customer 
a single odm usually provides our chipsets to numerous oems 
however  we attempt to maintain a close relationship with the target oem to monitor end market demand 
due to the use of odms  our direct customer base is relatively concentrated  although we believe that the number of total oems who purchase our chipsets through odms is broader 
we anticipate that we may continue to experience changes in our odm customer base as our end customers change odms for a variety of reasons while still using our chipsets 
we provide customer incentives to some of our direct and indirect customers 
these obligations are estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time at which we ship product to the customers based on quotes provided to the customer 
estimating incentive amounts requires that we make estimates regarding the percentage of committed incentives that will be submitted by our customers and the value of the incentives at the time of redemption 
these estimates may require revisions at later dates if the actual sales data submitted by the customers differs significantly from the original estimates  which may have the effect of increasing or decreasing net revenue in particular periods 
we defer recognition of revenue and the related cost of goods sold on shipments to distributors that have rights of return or price protection privileges on unsold products until the products are sold by the distributors to their customers 
price protection rights grant distributors the right to a credit in the event of declines in the price of our products 
we expect to continue to have major concentrations of sales to a relatively small number of odm and oem customers

in  hon hai precision industry co 
ltd 
and utstarcom  inc accounted for and of our net revenue  respectively 
substantially all of our sales are to customers outside the united states and canada 
sales to customers in asia accounted for  and of net revenue in the years ended december   and  respectively 
because many of our odm customers are located in asia  we anticipate that a majority of our revenue will continue to come from sales to customers in that region 
although a large percentage of our sales are made to customers in asia  we believe that a significant number of the systems designed by these customers are then sold through to oems outside of asia 
all of our sales are denominated in united states dollars 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold relates primarily to the purchase of silicon wafers  costs associated with assembly  test and inbound and outbound shipping of our chipsets  costs of personnel  materials and occupancy associated with manufacturing support and quality assurance  royalty costs and write downs to state inventory at the lower of cost or market caused by product obsolescence and transitions from older to newer products 
our cost of goods sold also includes additional costs associated with fluctuations in the price of raw materials used in the manufacturing of our chips 
additionally  our cost of goods sold includes accruals for estimated warranty obligations  which we record when revenue is recognized 
estimated warranty obligations are adjusted each period to reflect actual warranty experience 
because we do not have long term  fixed supply agreements  our wafer  assembly and test costs are subject to changes based on the cyclical demand for semiconductors 
in addition  after we purchase wafers from foundries  we also typically bear the yield risk related to manufacturing these wafers into finished goods 
research and development 
research and development expense relates primarily to compensation and associated costs related to development employees and contractors  mask and reticle costs  prototype wafers  software and computer aided design software licenses  intellectual property license costs  reference design development costs  development testing and evaluation costs  regulatory testing costs  depreciation expense and allocated occupancy costs 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense relates primarily to compensation and associated costs for marketing and sales personnel  sales commissions to independent sales representatives  public relations  promotional and other marketing expenses  expenses for travel  trade shows and depreciation  resource planning software and allocated occupancy costs 

table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expense relates primarily to compensation and associated costs for general and administrative personnel  legal and professional fees  charges related to allowance for doubtful accounts  enterprise resource planning software and allocated occupancy costs 
amortization of acquired intangible assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets relates to assets acquired in the zydas  attansic and u nav acquisitions 
acquisition related identified intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic lives of three to four years for purchased technology  two to six years for customer relationships and two to four years for covenants not to compete 
acquired in process research and development 
acquired in process research and development relates to the in process research and development expensed upon the acquisition of zydas  attansic and u nav  as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed 
interest income and expense 
interest income consists of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and investment balances and realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable securities 
impairment of long term investments 
impairment of long term investments relates to the other than temporary  non operating write down of the carrying value of our investments in auction rate securities  such securities were rated aaa and aa at the date of purchase 
the liquidity and fair value of these securities has been negatively impacted by the uncertainty in the credit markets and the exposure of these securities to the financial condition of bond insurance companies 
in november  the insurance companies sponsoring two of the auction rate securities we hold exercised their put rights and have exchanged preferred stock for all the underlying assets collateralizing these securities 
these insurance companies ceased paying dividends on the preferred stock in december since all of our held auction rate securities have been subject to multiple auction processes for which there have been insufficient bidders on the scheduled rollover dates and the auctions have subsequently failed  we have used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of these investments as of december  see the discussion in liquidity and capital resources in part ii  item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in part ii  item a  as well as note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for more detailed information on our investments in auction rate securities and this impairment charge 
provision for income taxes 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial statement purposes and the realizability of assets in future years 
we recorded a net income tax expense of  million and million for  and  respectively 
in we recorded an income tax benefit of million related to a change in a state tax filing position  which resulted in the recording of a net deferred tax benefit 
we recorded income tax benefits of million and million for and  respectively  related to releases of valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue primarily from the sale of our communication integrated circuits  or ics 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  or sab sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for the products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 
we provide incentives to some of our direct and indirect customers 
these obligations are estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time at which we ship product to the customers in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
estimated incentive amounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue and are based on agreements between us and our customers 
estimating 
table of contents incentive amounts requires that we make estimates regarding the percentage of committed incentives that will be submitted by our customers and the value of the incentives at the time of redemption 
these estimates may require revisions at later dates if the actual claims submitted by the customers differ significantly from the original estimates  which may have the effect of increasing or decreasing net revenue and gross profit as a percentage of revenue in a particular period 
we defer recognition of revenue and the related cost of goods sold on shipments to distributors that have rights of return or price protection privileges on unsold products until the products are sold by the distributor to its customers 
price protection rights grant distributors the right to a credit in the event of declines in the price of our products 
fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  auction rate securities  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
we believe that the carrying amounts of the financial instruments approximate their respective fair values 
when there is no readily available market data  we may make fair value estimates  which may not necessarily represent the amounts that could be realized in a current or future sale of these assets 
marketable securities 
we classify marketable securities as available for sale 
we view our available for sale portfolio as available for use in current operations 
accordingly  we have classified all investments with a readily available market as short term  even though the maturity dates may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet date  because of the intent to sell these securities prior to maturity to meet liquidity needs or as part of a risk management program 
when we find that a readily available market does not currently exist for the securities  we classify these securities as long term due to the potential inability to sell the securities within one year of the current balance sheet date 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  and we record temporary unrealized holding gains and losses as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
we charge unrealized losses against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  sec sab topic m  other than temporary impairment of certain investments in debt and equity securities and financial accounting standards board  or fasb  staff position  or fsp  financial accounting standards  or fas  and  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  we review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary 
these factors include but are not limited to the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position  the extent to which fair value is less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and  our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
realized gains and losses are accounted for on the specific identification method 
inventory valuation 
we continually assess the recoverability of our inventory based on assumptions about demand and market conditions 
forecasted demand is determined based on historical sales and expected future sales 
we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or its current estimated market value 
we reduce our inventory to the estimated lower of cost or market value to account for its obsolescence or lack of marketability 
reductions are calculated as the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that may adversely affect our operating results 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  we may have higher gross margins when products are sold 
stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  using the modified prospective application method 
under the modified prospective application method  compensation expense for stock based awards granted by us as a public company prior to  but not yet vested as of january   is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provision of sfas for stock based awards granted before november  the date on which we filed our registration statement for our initial public offering  we continue to record compensation expense following the provisions of accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after december  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
at december  there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans  net of estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of years 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black sholes option valuation model and the assumptions used shown in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
for   and the first six months of  we based our expected term on the expected terms used by similar entities since we did not have sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term of the stock option awards granted 
for the final six months of  we estimated the expected term based on our historical financial data and estimates of future option exercise activity  as well as the expected terms used by similar entities 
for options granted after december   we estimated volatility based on considerations of the implied volatility of long term options traded on the open market and the average historical volatilities of our stock and those of similar entities 
for the final six months of  we estimated the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based entirely on considerations of the implied volatility of long term options traded on the open market and our average historical volatilities 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits and their credit worthiness  as determined by our review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience  our anticipation of uncollectible accounts receivable and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established  we might not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
our receivables are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers 
therefore  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make collection of our accounts receivable more difficult  require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and negatively affect our working capital 
product warranty provision 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our chipset suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the cost of replacement chipsets  rework and inbound and outbound freight costs incurred in replacing a chipset after failure 
we continuously monitor chipset returns for warranty and maintain an accrual for the related warranty expenses based on historical experience of similar products as well as various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and we adjust the warranty accrual rate based on these actual experiences and specific expected obligations 
when actual failure rates  cost of chipset replacement  rework and inbound and outbound freight costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual are made 
any such revisions may have the effect of increasing or decreasing gross profit both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue in a particular period in which these estimates are adjusted 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider historical levels of income  projections of future income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and practical tax planning strategies 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we would increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future us taxable income 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and foreign countries  and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions 
we believe that our tax return positions are fully supported  but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions  which may not be fully sustained 
however  our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that result from these challenges in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related assets and liabilities requires management judgment and estimates 
we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin we believe that our provision for uncertain tax positions  including related interest and penalties  is adequate based on information currently available to us 
the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision  net income and cash flows 
our provision for uncertain tax positions is attributable to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international tax operations 
our overall provision requirement could change due to the issuance of new regulations or new case law  negotiations with tax authorities  resolution with respect to individual audit issues  or the entire audit  or the expiration of statutes of limitations 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
we record goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we amortize acquisition related identified intangibles on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives of three to four years for purchased technology  two to six years for customer relationships and two to four years for covenants not to compete 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  we measure and test goodwill on an annual basis on october or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exit 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value  including goodwill 
we have one reporting unit 
we determine the fair value of the reporting unit by taking the market capitalization of the reporting unit as determined through quoted market prices 
a potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value 
we only perform the second step of the process if a potential impairment exists  and it involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets other than goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit and if the difference is less than the net book value of goodwill  impairment exists and is recorded 
we have not been required to perform this second step of the process since our adoption of sfas because the fair value of the reporting unit has exceeded the net book value at every measurement date 

table of contents long lived assets 
we account for long lived assets  including other purchased intangible assets  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns in the semiconductor industry  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of an asset is impaired  based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if this comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using quoted market prices or discounted expected future cash flows utilizing a discount rate consistent with the guidance provided in fasb concepts statement no 
 using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
our estimates regarding future anticipated net revenue and cash flows  the remaining economic life of the products and technologies  or both  may differ from those used to assess the recoverability of assets 
in that event  impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long lived assets may be required  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase to net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
due to the recent economic downturn  we tested our long lived assets for impairment as of december  and determined that they were not impaired 
litigation and settlement costs 
we are periodically involved in litigation and other legal proceedings 
we prosecute and defend these matters aggressively 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot assure that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation including any potential substantial settlement charges 
in addition  the determination of intellectual property litigation may require us to pay damages for past infringement or to obtain a license under the opposing party s intellectual property rights and pay license fees and royalties  which could adversely impact our profitability in future periods  or prevent us from selling certain of our products or to cease in the development of a certain type of technology 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we would record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency if information available prior to issuance of financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
actual liabilities in any such disputes or litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional costs

we believe the effects of the recent economic downturn have also slowed our revenues in the networking channel significantly  especially in the fourth quarter of in our pc oem channel  net revenue decreased two percent during the year ended december  compared to while we experienced increased unit demand due to further customer acceptance of our g and ethernet chipsets and further adoption of our draft n solutions  these increases were more than offset by declining average selling prices for our chipsets 
we believe the effects of the recent economic downturn have also slowed our revenues in the pc oem channel significantly  especially in the fourth quarter of the increase in revenue in our consumer channel during the year ended december  compared to resulted from the further acceptance of our g mobile wireless networking products in gaming devices and mobile phones and the introduction of our gps products in december  partially offset by decreased demand for our pas products 
gross profit years ended december  change in gross profit of net revenue gross profit as a percentage of revenue remained flat during the year ended december  compared to  primarily due to a decline in product costs related to supply chain efficiencies and changes in product mix  partially offset by average selling price declines of

research and development years ended december  change in research and development of net revenue the increase in research and development expenses of million during the year ended december  compared to was primarily due to additional compensation related costs of million  partially attributable to a increase in the number of employees engaged in research and development activities to support our growth in the comparable periods 
the headcount increase was due primarily to an expansion of our research and development personnel in our six design centers and to a lesser extent  the additional headcount added as part of the u nav acquisition in december of of the increase in compensation related expenses  million was due to an increase in stock based compensation 
further  there were increases in software expenses of million and consulting expenses of million resulting from increased chip development efforts for new and existing markets

acquisition related identified intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic lives of three to four years for purchased technology  two to six years for customer relationships and two to four years for covenants not to compete 
we expect that amortization of our acquired intangible assets will remain flat in the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of acquired in process research and development years ended december  change in acquired in process research and development of net revenue the acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  charges of million for related to the acquisitions of the remaining of the capital stock of attansic and u nav 
no ipr d charges were recognized in the amounts allocated to ipr d  were determined through estimates and valuation techniques based on the terms and details of each acquisition 
the amounts allocated to ipr d were expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future use existed at the date of acquisition 
the fair value of the ipr d for each of the acquisitions was determined using the income approach 
the income approach focuses on the income producing capability of an asset 
it incorporates the calculation of the present value of future economic benefits such as cash earnings  cost savings  tax deductions and proceeds from disposition 
indications are developed by discounting expected 
table of contents cash flows to the present value at a rate of return that incorporates the risk free rate for the use of funds  the expected rate of inflation and risks associated with the particular investment 
the discount rate selected is generally based on the rate of return available from alternative investments of similar type and quality 
each project was analyzed to determine the unique technological innovations  the existence and reliance on core technology  the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the complexity  cost and time to complete the remaining development 
future cash flows for each project were estimated based on forecasted revenue and costs  taking into account product life cycles  and market penetration and growth rates 
the ipr d charges include only the fair value of ipr d performed as of the respective acquisition dates 
the fair value of any developed technology is included in intangible assets and is amortized accordingly 
the amounts recorded as ipr d represent the estimated fair values and approximate amounts at which an independent third party would value these projects as of the respective acquisition dates 
at december   the single chip gps device project associated with our acquisition of u nav was approximately complete  with an estimated years remaining to complete at an estimated cost of million 
at december   the ethernet controller and switch projects associated with our acquisition of attansic were substantially complete  and actual results were materially consistent with our assumptions at the time of the acquisition 
as of december   the mobile communications ic projects associated with our acquisition of zydas were discontinued  however we do not expect discontinuation of the project to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
the original assumptions consisted of expected completion dates for the ipr d projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projects for the products once they entered the market 
interest income  net years ended december  change in interest income  net of net revenue during the year ended december   interest income decreased compared to due primarily to significantly decreased yields on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
this yield decline was partially offset by an increase in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  excluding auction rate securities  of million during the year ended december  compared to  resulting primarily from the generation of cash from operations  the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases through our employee stock purchase plan 
this increase was partially offset by outlays for purchases of property and equipment 
impairment of long term investments our long term investments consist primarily of auction rate securities 
during and  we recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  to reduce the carrying value of certain of these auction rate securities 
we have determined that the impairment charges are other than temporary in nature in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  sec sab topic m  other than temporary impairment of certain investments in debt and equity securities and fsp fas and  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments

the estimated fair value of these securities could decrease or increase significantly in the future based on market conditions and we may be required to record additional losses for impairment if we determine there are further declines in fair value

gross profit years ended december  change in gross profit of net revenue gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased in the year ended december  compared to primarily as a result of a greater concentration in higher margin products as a percentage of our total product mix  partially offset by a decline in the overall blended selling prices of our products shipped 
we were able to offset declines in average selling prices with supply chain efficiencies as the number of chipsets shipped in approximately doubled 
research and development years ended december  change in research and development of net revenue the increase in research and development expenses of million was partly due to additional compensation related costs of million  primarily attributable to a increase in the number of employees engaged in research and development activities in to support our growth 
the headcount increase was due primarily to an expansion of our research and development personnel in our five design centers and to a lesser extent  the additional headcount acquired as part of the u nav acquisition

the amounts allocated to ipr d  were determined through estimates and valuation techniques based on the terms and details of each acquisition the amounts allocated to ipr d were expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future use existed at the date of acquisition 
the fair value of the ipr d for each of the acquisitions was determined using the income approach as described above

the assumptions consist of expected completion dates for the iprd projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projects for the product once they have entered the market 
interest income  net years ended december  change in interest income  net of net revenue during the year ended december   we experienced increased interest income compared to the same period in  partly due to a million increase in cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and auction rate securities  resulting primarily from the generation of cash from operations  the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases through our employee stock purchase plan 
this increase was partly offset by cash outlays for the acquisitions of the remaining outstanding shares of attansic  the u nav acquisition and for capital equipment 
the effect on interest income of the increased cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in was partially offset by decreased yields achieved on our investment portfolio in the year ended over the same period in impairment of long term investments during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of the auction rate securities we hold

based on our earnings history and projected future taxable income  we determined that it was more likely than not a portion of our valuation

accordingly  we released this portion of the valuation allowance that was previously recorded against our deferred tax assets

in august  we terminated our existing loan agreement and standby letters of credit with a bank  and entered into a new revolving line of credit facility of up to million with a different bank to fund working capital requirements  or the facility 
the facility is unsecured and contains certain financial and non financial covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
interest on any borrowings is payable quarterly and is calculated either at the bank s prime rate or the london interbank offered rate plus and  respectively  at december   generally  we select such rate at the time of borrowing 
borrowings under the facility are due august  in august  we issued two new standby letters of credit totaling million to secure operating leases for equipment  which reduced the amount available to borrow under the facility from million to million 
as of december   the standby letters of credit were reduced to million and no balances were outstanding against the facility 
long term investments primarily consist of auction rate securities representing our interest in insurance capital notes  issued by special purpose entities sponsored by insurance companies  such securities were rated aaa and aa at the date of purchase 
a portion of these securities are collateralized by tradable short term corporate and government notes  bonds and commercial paper 
liquidity for these securities has historically been provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually every days 
because of the short interest rate reset period  we have historically recorded them as current available for sale securities 
the liquidity and fair value of these securities has been negatively impacted by the uncertainty in the credit markets and the exposure of these securities to the financial condition of bond insurance companies 
as of december   we held auction rate securities with a par value of million and an estimated fair value of million 
to date we have recorded million as other than temporary impairments 
each of these securities had been subject to multiple auction processes for which there had been insufficient bidders on the scheduled rollover dates 
we have re classified these auction rate securities as long term available for sale securities as of september  we believe we have the ability to hold these securities for longer than a period of twelve months 
in november  the insurance companies sponsoring two of the auction rate securities we hold exercised their put rights and have exchanged preferred stock for all the underlying assets collateralizing these securities 
these insurance companies ceased paying dividends on the preferred stock in december as a result of the recent economic down turn  we expect to experience modest increases in our operating expenses in absolute dollars  in research  and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses  for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business strategy 
as a result  we anticipate that operating expenses as well as planned capital expenditures will constitute a material use of our cash resources 

table of contents we believe that research and development is essential to expanding our core technologies and product offerings 
our research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these expenditures resulted in enhancement of our product offerings  technological know how and inventions that have yielded numerous issued and pending us patents 
we expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses and intend to fund these expenses with operating cash flow  cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  the continuing market acceptance of our products and potential future acquisitions 
in august  we acquired zydas for an aggregate of approximately million in cash and stock at closing and agreed to pay additional consideration upon attaining certain defined milestones 
these milestones were met as of december  and the respective payments have been made and have been recorded as compensation expense 
in december  we acquired of the outstanding shares of attansic for million consisting of million in cash and million in our common stock 
in november  we acquired the remaining of the outstanding shares of attansic for approximately million in cash 
in december  we acquired certain assets of u nav for approximately million in cash  stock and assumed liabilities 
we may enter into arrangements in the future with respect to potential investments in  acquisitions of  complementary businesses  products or technologies  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional debt would result in increased interest expense and could result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
we have not made arrangements to obtain additional financing and there is no assurance that such financing  if required  will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in sec regulations 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions payments due by period less than year years after years total contractual obligations operating leases commitments under licensing agreements purchase of goods and services total we have excluded million in fin liabilities and million of non current deferred tax liabilities from the contractual obligations table because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the periodic cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for a discussion of income taxes 
recent accounting pronouncements in december the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  or sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r also provides guidance for recognizing changes in an acquirer s existing income tax valuation allowances and tax uncertainty accruals that result from a business combination transaction as adjustments to income tax expense 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we believe sfas r may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements when effective  depending on the size and nature of any future business combinations that we may enter into  and any future adjustments made to tax valuation allowances and uncertainty accruals related to business combinations entered into prior to the effective date 
effective january   we adopted eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities  or eitf eitf requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities be deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  we have adopted the provisions of sfas with respect to its financial assets and financial liabilities only 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities during the first quarter of  however we are still evaluating the impact  if any  it will have on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
sfas requires disclosure that establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
the inputs for the first two levels are considered observable and the last is unobservable and include the following level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities  level quoted prices in markets that are not active  or inputs which are observable  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the asset or liability  or level prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and are unobservable 
in the year ended december  there was no material impact from the adoption of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  or fsp fsp clarifies the application of sfas in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
fsp became effective immediately  including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
therefore  we have adopted the provisions of fsp in its financial statements for the year ended december  the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas sfas allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for specified financial assets and liabilities on a contract by contract basis 
we did not elect to adopt the fair value option under sfas item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are  in order of importance  to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
as of december   our investments were in money market funds  commercial paper  corporate notes  corporate bonds  us government securities and auction rate securities 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including money market funds  commercial paper and government and non government debt securities 
our long term investments primarily consist of auction rate securities  which have been classified as long term due to the lack of a liquid market for these securities 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we believe that a change in interest rates will not have a significant impact on the fair value of our portfolio or on our interest income 
long term investments primarily consist of auction rate securities representing our interest in insurance capital notes  issued by special purpose entities sponsored by insurance companies  such securities were rated aaa and aa at the date of purchase 
a portion of these securities are collateralized by tradable short term corporate and government notes  bonds and commercial paper 
liquidity for these securities has historically been provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually every days

the liquidity and fair value of these securities has been negatively impacted by the uncertainty in the credit markets and the exposure of these securities to the financial condition of bond insurance companies 
as of december   we held auction rate securities with a par value of million and an estimated fair value of million 
to date we have recorded million in losses as other than temporary impairments 
each of these securities had been subject to multiple auction processes for which there had been insufficient bidders on the scheduled rollover dates 
the investment bank who organized the auctions for these securities filed for bankruptcy during the quarter ended september   and since such time  no auctions have occurred 
we do not know if or when future auctions will be held 
in november  the insurance companies sponsoring two of 
table of contents the auction rate securities we hold exercised their put rights and have exchanged preferred stock for all the underlying assets collateralizing these securities 
these insurance companies ceased paying dividends on the preferred stock in december we will not be able to liquidate any of our remaining auction rate securities until a future auction is successful  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  or the notes are redeemed 
since september   we have re classified these auction rate securities as long term available for sale securities and have maintained this classification 
we believe we have the ability to hold these securities for longer than a period of months 
the following table presents the amounts of cash equivalents and marketable securities in thousands  except percentages that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of december  our variable rate securities consist of money market funds and auction rate securities 
maturing in three months or less maturing between three months and one year maturing greater than one year total fixed rate weighted average interest rate variable rate weighted average interest rate our exposure to market risk also relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments  primarily certain borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
in august  we terminated our existing loan agreement and standby letters of credit with a bank  and entered into a new revolving line of credit facility of up to million with a different bank to fund working capital requirements  or the facility 
the facility is unsecured and contains certain financial and non financial covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
interest on any borrowings is payable quarterly and is calculated either at the bank s prime rate or the london interbank offered rate plus and  respectively  at december   generally  we select such rate at the time of borrowing 
borrowings under the facility are due august  in august  we issued two new standby letters of credit totaling million to secure operating leases for equipment  which reduced the amount available to borrow under the facility from million to million 
as of december   the standby letters of credit were reduced to million and no balances were outstanding against the facility 
we do not believe that a change in the prime rate would have a significant impact on our interest expense 
currently  our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations for revenues and cost of goods sold is not material 
our sales agreements generally provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
similarly  the majority of our purchases related to cost of goods sold are denominated and paid in united states dollars and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
the risk associated with fluctuating currency exchange rates is generally limited to our operating expenses and capital expenditures denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar as approximately of our employees are located outside of the united states 
we believe that a change in currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on the fair value of our operating expenses or capital expenditures 
increases or decreases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more or less expensive  which could have an impact on our business 
future fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our business 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions  nor do we believe that we have a material exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk
