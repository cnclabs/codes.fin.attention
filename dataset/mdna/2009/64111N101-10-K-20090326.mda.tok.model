overview we were founded in august to develop data warehouse appliances that enable real time business intelligence 
our nps appliance integrates database  server and storage platforms in a purpose built unit to enable detailed queries and analyses on large volumes of stored data 
the results of these queries and analyses provide organizations with actionable information to improve their business operations 
the amount of data that is being generated and stored by organizations is exploding 
as the volume of data continues to grow  enterprises have recognized the value of analyzing such data to significantly improve their operations and competitive position 
this increasing amount of data and the importance of data analysis have led to a heightened demand for data warehouses that provide the critical framework for data driven enterprise decision making and business intelligence 
many traditional data warehouse systems were initially designed to aggregate and analyze smaller quantities of data  using general purpose database  server and storage platforms patched together as a data warehouse system 
such patchwork architectures are often used by default to store and analyze data  despite the fact that they are not optimized to handle terabytes of constantly growing and changing data and as a result  are not as effective in handling the in depth analyses that large businesses are now requiring of their data warehouse systems 
the increasing number of users accessing the data warehouse and the sophistication of the queries employed by these users is making the strain of using these legacy systems even more challenging for many organizations 
business intelligence solutions are still in their early stages of growth and their continued adoption and growth in the marketplace remain uncertain 
additionally  our appliance approach requires our customers to run their data warehouses in new and innovative ways and often requires our customers to replace their existing equipment and supplier relationships  which they may be unwilling to do  especially in light of the often critical nature of the components and systems involved and the significant capital and other resources they may have previously invested 
furthermore  purchases of our products involve material changes to established purchasing patterns and policies 
even if prospective customers recognize the need for our products  they may not select our nps solution because they choose to wait for the introduction of products and technologies that serve as a replacement or substitute for  or represent an improvement over  our nps solutions 
therefore  our future success also depends on our ability to maintain our leadership position in the data warehouse market and to proactively address the needs of the market and our customers to further drive the adoption of business intelligence and to sustain our competitive advantage versus competing approaches to business intelligence and alternate product offerings 
recently  there has been a significant deterioration in economic conditions in many of the countries and regions in which we do business 
if current global economic conditions  or economic conditions in the united states  persist or deteriorate further  our current or prospective customers may experience serious cash flow problems  or may otherwise reduce their information technology spending  causing them to modify  delay or cancel plans to purchase our products  which would have an adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  some of our traditional competitors have introduced their own integrated data warehousing solutions which may cause our sales cycles to be delayed and may have an adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are currently headquartered in marlborough  massachusetts 
our personnel and operations are also located throughout the united states  as well as in canada  the united kingdom  australia  france  germany  ireland  italy  
table of contents japan  korea and poland 
we expect to continue to add personnel in the united states and internationally to provide additional geographic sales and technical support coverage 
revenue we derive our revenue from sales of products and related services 
we sell our data warehouse appliances worldwide to large global enterprises  mid market companies and government agencies through our direct salesforce as well as indirectly via distribution partners 
to date  we have derived the substantial majority of our revenue from customers located in the united states 
for fiscal  and  us customers accounted for approximately  and our revenue  respectively 
on may   we acquired nutech  an advanced analytics and optimization solutions company 
the results of nutech s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements since that date 
for fiscal  nutech accounted for approximately of our revenue 
its revenue is classified as services revenue in our consolidated financial statements 
product revenue 
the significant majority of our revenue is generated through the sale of our nps appliances  primarily to companies in the following vertical industries telecommunications  digital media  retail  financial services  outsourced analytics  government and health and life sciences 
our future revenue growth will depend in significant part upon further sales of our nps appliances to our existing customer base 
in addition  increasing our sales to new customers in existing vertical industries we currently serve and in other vertical industries that depend upon high performance data analysis is an important element of our strategy 
we consider the further development of our direct and indirect sales channels in domestic and international markets to be a key to our future revenue growth and the global acceptance of our products 
our future revenue growth will also depend on our ability to sustain the high levels of customer satisfaction generated by providing high touch  high quality support 
in addition  the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
our future revenue growth is dependent on the successful development and introduction of new products and enhancements 
such new introductions and enhancements could reduce demand for our existing products and cause customers to delay purchasing decisions until such new products and enhancements are introduced 
to address these risks we will seek to expand our sales and marketing efforts  continue to pursue research and development as well as acquisition opportunities to expand and enhance our product offering 
services revenue 
we sell product maintenance  installation  training and professional services to our customers 
the percentage of our total revenue derived from services was in fiscal and in each of fiscal and cost of revenue and gross profit cost of product revenue consists primarily of amounts paid to sanmina sci corporation  or sanmina  our contract manufacturer  in connection with the procurement of hardware components and assembly of those components into our nps appliance systems 
neither we nor sanmina enter into long term supply contracts for our hardware components  which can cause our cost of product revenue to fluctuate 
these product costs are recorded when the related product revenue is recognized 
cost of revenue also includes shipping  warehousing and logistics expenses  warranty reserves  depreciation and amortization and inventory write downs to write down the carrying value of inventory to the lower of cost or market 
shipping  warehousing and logistics costs are recognized as incurred 
estimated warranty costs are recorded when the related product revenue is recognized 
cost of services revenue consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits for our support staff and worldwide installation and technical account management teams and amounts paid to third parties to provide on site hardware service 
our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including the relative mix of product versus services revenue  our mix of direct versus indirect sales as sales through our indirect channels may have lower average selling prices and gross profit  and changes in the average selling prices of our products and services  which can be adversely affected by competitive pressures 
additional factors affecting gross profit include the timing of new product introductions  which may reduce demand for our existing product as customers await the arrival of new products and could also result in additional reserves against older product inventory  cost reductions through redesign of existing products and the cost of our systems hardware 
the data warehouse market is highly 
table of contents competitive and we expect this competition to intensify in the future  especially as we move into additional vertical industries 
if our market share in such industries increases  we expect pricing pressure to increase  which will reduce product gross margins 
if our customer base continues to grow  it will be necessary for us to continue to make significant upfront investments in our customer service and support infrastructure to support this growth 
the rate at which we add new customers will affect the level of these upfront investments 
the timing of these additional expenditures could materially affect our cost of revenue  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue  in any particular period 
this could cause downward pressure on gross margins 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses 
personnel related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
our headcount increased to employees at january  from employees at january  included in this headcount increase are employees from the nutech acquisition 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  sales commissions  marketing program expenses and allocated facilities expenses 
we plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing by increasing the number of our sales personnel worldwide  expanding our domestic and international sales and marketing activities  and further building brand awareness 
accordingly  we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in total dollars although we expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenue 
generally  sales personnel are not immediately productive and thus sales and marketing expenses related to new sales hires are not immediately accompanied by higher revenue 
hiring additional sales personnel may reduce short term operating margins until the sales personnel become productive and generate revenue 
accordingly  the timing of hiring sales personnel and the rate at which they become productive will affect our future performance 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  product prototype expenses  allocated facilities expenses and depreciation of equipment used in research and development activities 
in addition to our us development teams  we use an offshore development team employed by a contract engineering firm in pune  india 
research and development expenses are recorded as incurred 
we devote substantial resources to the development of additional functionality for existing products and the development of new products 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because we believe they are essential to maintaining and increasing our competitive position 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in total dollars  although we expect such expense to decrease as a percentage of total revenue 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  allocated facilities expenses  fees for professional services such as legal  accounting and compliance  investor relation expenses and insurance premiums  including premiums related to director and officer insurance 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in total dollars and to increase slightly as a percentage of revenue in fiscal as we continue to invest in infrastructure to support continued growth 
other interest income and interest expense interest income and interest expense primarily consist of interest income on investments and cash balances and interest expense on our outstanding debt 
in addition  interest income includes realized gains and losses on marketable securities 

table of contents other income expense  net other income expense  net primarily consists of losses or gains on translation of non us dollar transactions into non us dollars  changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts  losses or gains on disposal of fixed assets  and mark to market adjustments on preferred stock warrants 
as these warrants for our preferred stock are no longer outstanding  there will be no mark to market adjustment expense going forward 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  the disclosure of contingencies as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we evaluate these estimates  judgments and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
although we believe that our estimates  judgments and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k  the following accounting policies involve the most judgment and complexity revenue recognition  stock based compensation  inventory valuation  accounting for income taxes valuation of investments  and valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
accordingly  we believe the policies set forth above are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
if actual results or events differ materially from the estimates  judgments and assumptions used by us in applying these policies  our reported financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from sales of products and related services and enter into multiple element arrangements in the normal course of business with our customers and distribution partners 
in all of our arrangements  we do not recognize any revenue until we can determine that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and we deem collection to be probable 
in making these judgments  we evaluate these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement 
we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by the customer and us to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we consider delivery to have occurred when product has been delivered to the customer and no post delivery obligations exist other than ongoing support obligations 
in instances where customer acceptance is required  delivery is deemed to have occurred when customer acceptance has been achieved 
fees are fixed or determinable 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within normal payment terms 
if the fee is subject to refund or adjustment  we recognize revenue when the right to a refund or adjustment lapses 
if offered payment terms exceed our normal terms  we recognize revenue as the amounts become due and payable or upon the receipt of cash 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review for all transactions at the inception of an arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if  based 
table of contents upon our evaluation  we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  revenue is deferred and recognized upon the receipt of cash 
we enter into multiple element arrangements in the normal course of business with our customers 
elements in such arrangements are recognized when delivered and the amount allocated to each element is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe 
vsoe is determined based upon the amount charged when an element is sold separately 
vsoe of the fair value of maintenance services may also be determined based on a substantive maintenance renewal clause  if any  within a customer contract 
our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type  purchase volume and maintenance term 
we review services revenue sold separately and maintenance renewal rates on a periodic basis and update  when appropriate  our vsoe of fair value for such services to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 
when vsoe exists for undelivered elements but not for the delivered elements  we use the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair values of the undelivered elements are initially deferred 
the residual contract amount is then allocated to and recognized for the delivered elements 
thereafter  the amount deferred for the undelivered element is recognized when those elements are delivered 
for arrangements in which vsoe does not exist for each undelivered element  revenue for the entire arrangement is deferred and not recognized until delivery of all the elements without vsoe has occurred  unless the only undelivered element is maintenance in which case the entire contract is recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
the determination of vsoe is highly judgmental and is a key factor in determining whether revenue may be recognized or must be deferred and the extent to which it may be recognized once the various elements of an arrangement are delivered 
we assess vsoe based on previous sales of products and services  the type and size of customer and renewal rates in contracts 
we monitor vsoe on an ongoing basis 
a change in our assessment of or our inability to establish vsoe for products or services may result in significant variation in our revenues and operating results 
our service revenue also consists of software customization and consulting service contracts recognized in accordance with accounting research bulletin arb no 
long term construction type contracts and the relevant guidance of statement of position sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts as prescribed by sop  software revenue recognition 
services revenues are recognized either as services are performed and billed to customers for time and material arrangements or on the percentage of completion method for fixed fee contracts 
percentage of completion is measured by the percentage of software customization or consulting hours incurred to date to total estimated hours 
this method is used because management has determined that past experience has shown expended hours to be the best measure of progress on these engagements 
revisions in total estimated hours are reflected in the accounting period in which the required revisions become known 
anticipated losses on contracts are charged to income in their entirety when such losses become evident 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
we have selected the black scholes option pricing model to determine fair value of stock option awards 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock 
changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock options  which could have a material impact on our financial statements 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates  our stock based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted 
the calculation of compensation cost in accordance with sfas r for options issued prior to our initial public offering required our board of directors  with input from management  to estimate the fair market value of our 
table of contents common stock on the date of grant of those options 
these estimates of fair market value were determined based upon a number of objective and subjective factors and were  therefore  inherently subjective estimates 
we account for stock based compensation expense for non employees using the fair value method prescribed by emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services and the black scholes option pricing model  and recorded the fair value of non employee stock options as an expense over the vesting term of the option 
for stock options and restricted stock we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the awards vesting periods for those awards that contain only a service vesting feature 
inventory valuation inventories primarily consist of finished systems and are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
a large portion of our inventory also relates to evaluation units located at customer locations  as some of our customers test our equipment prior to purchasing 
the number of evaluation units has increased due to our overall growth and an increase in our customer base 
we assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials and finished goods  on a periodic basis 
we write down inventory to its estimated market value if less than its cost 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our products and technological obsolescence of our products 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required 
during the fiscal years ended january   and  we recorded charges of million  million and million  respectively  to write inventory down to the lower of cost or market 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions and we use estimates in determining our provisions for income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which is the asset and liability method for accounting and reporting for income taxes 
under sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using statutory rates 
the income tax accounting process involves estimating our actual current tax liability  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense 
as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal  a full valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets consisting primarily of us net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
however  based upon our operating results over recent years and through january  as well as an assessment of our expected future results of operations  we determined in the fourth quarter of fiscal that it had become more likely than not that we would realize a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets in the us as a result  we reduced our valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of fiscal  which resulted in recognition of deferred tax assets of million  a one time income tax benefit of approximately million  a million reduction to goodwill for acquired tax benefits and million reserve for uncertain tax positions in the us  which was recorded as a reduction to our tax carryforward attributes 
significant management judgment was required to determine when the realization of our deferred tax assets was deemed more likely than not 
had we not released the valuation allowance in fiscal  we would have reported materially different results 
as of january   we had a remaining valuation allowance of million against net deferred tax assets in the us of which million was recorded against other comprehensive income  and a remaining valuation allowance of million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in the us consisted of capital losses that we had determined were not more 
table of contents likely than not to be realized 
the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards that will likely expire without being utilized income tax expense related to our international subsidiaries generally results from taxable income generated by the subsidiary pursuant to intercompany service agreements 
we believe the compensation associated with these service agreements is reasonable in light of the level and nature of services performed by our subsidiaries 
however  if a foreign tax jurisdiction or the internal revenue service were to challenge these arrangements  we could be subject to additional income tax expense either in the united states or the foreign jurisdiction 
in accordance with sfas r  our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stock based compensation in the amount of approximately million as of january  consistent with prior years  we use the with and without approach as described in eitf topic no 
d in determining the order in which our tax attributes are utilized for book purposes 
the with and without approach results in the recognition of the windfall stock option tax benefit through additional paid in capital only after all of our other tax attributes have been considered in the annual tax accrual computation in the period in which the tax benefit reduces taxes payable 
on february   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas the new standard defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit  in our judgment  which is greater than likely to be realized 
we did not recognize any change in our reserves for uncertain tax positions as a result of the adoption of this standard 
at the adoption date of february   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  the benefit of which  if recognized  would favorably affect our income tax rate in future periods 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
at january   we recorded an unrecognized tax benefit of million of which million would favorably affect our income tax rate in future periods 
to date we have not accrued interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions 
valuation of investments effective february   we implemented sfas no 
 fair value measurement  sfas  for our financial assets and liabilities that are re measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period  and non financial assets and liabilities that are re measured and reported at fair value at least annually 
sfas defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value principally cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities that have been classified as level  or within the fair value hierarchy as described in sfas fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices  interest rates and yield curves 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset or liability 
investments and marketable securities classified as available for sale are considered to be impaired when cost basis exceeds fair value 
we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other than temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including  among other factors  the duration of the period that  and extent to which  the fair value is less than cost basis  the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors  overall market conditions and trends  and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  a write down is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established 
assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty 
write downs  if recorded  could be materially different from the actual market performance of investments and marketable securities in our portfolio  
table of contents if  among other things  relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 
included in our long term marketable securities at january  and were auction rate securities ars most of which were aaa rated bonds  collateralized by federally guaranteed student loans 
ars are long term variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates that may reset through a dutch auction process that is designed to occur every to days 
historically  the carrying value par value of ars approximated fair market value due to the resetting of variable interest rates 
beginning in mid february and continuing throughout the period ended january   however  the auctions for ars then held by us were unsuccessful 
as a result  the interest rates on ars reset to the maximum rate per the applicable investment offering statements 
we will not be able to liquidate affected ars until a future auction on these investments is successful  a buyer is found outside the auction process  the securities are called or refinanced by the issuer  or the securities mature 
due to the long term nature of the underlying student loan bonds and the failure of the auction process to provide a current market  we classified these investments as long term on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  in light of these liquidity issues  we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of these ars investments 
the discounted cash flow analysis we performed considered the timing of expected future successful auctions  the impact of extended periods of maximum interest rates  collateralization of underlying security investments and the creditworthiness of the issuer 
the discounted cash flow analysis performed as of january  assumes a weighted average discount rate of and expected term of three years 
the discount rate was determined using a proxy based upon the current market rates for similar debt offerings within the aaa rated ars market 
the expected term was based on management s estimate of future liquidity 
as a result  as of january   we have estimated an aggregate loss of million  of which million was related to the impairment of ars deemed to be temporary and included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity and of which million was related to the impairment of ars classified as trading securities and included in other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
if we had used a term of one year or five years and a discount rate of and respectively  the gross unrealized loss would have been million or million  respectively 
if we had used a term of three years and a discount rate of or  the gross unrealized loss would have been million or million  respectively 
if we had used a term of three years and illiquidity discounts of or  the gross unrealized loss would have been million or million  respectively 
based on our ability to access our cash and short term investments and our expected cash flows  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these ars will affect our ability to operate our business as usual 
despite the failed auctions  we continue to receive cash flows in the form of specified interest payments from the issuers of ars 
in addition  except for certain ars with an aggregate par value of million with respect to which we have entered into an agreement allowing us to sell such ars at par in june  we have the intent and ability to hold our ars until a recovery of the impairment because we believe we have sufficient cash and other marketable securities on hand and from projected cash flows from operations such that we do not anticipate a need to sell our ars prior to a recovery to par value 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets intangible assets are valued based on estimates of future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the value of the asset below its carrying amount using forecasts of discounted future cash flows 
events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions  economic factors  unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities  loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts 
goodwill and intangible assets totaled million and million  respectively  at january  estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth  asset related expenditures  working capital levels and other factors 
different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
should the fair value of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets decline because of reduced 
table of contents operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  or as a result of changes in the discount rate  charges for impairment may be necessary

product revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of in fiscal and in fiscal these increases were primarily driven by a growing acceptance and need for data warehouse systems and are indicative of customers valuing the capabilities and return on investment that they provide 
these increases were based on increased sales volume  due primarily to sales to new and existing customers rather than price increases

services revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  of the increase in services revenue was attributable to million of service revenue generated by nutech 
the remainder of these increases was the result of increased product sales  and accompanying sales of new maintenance and support contracts combined with the renewal of maintenance and support contracts by existing customers 
all of our customers to date have purchased first year annual maintenance and support services and substantially all of our customers renewed their maintenance and support agreements 
gross margin total gross margin was in fiscal and was in fiscal and product gross margin was in fiscal and was in fiscal and this increase in fiscal was due primarily to a reduction in the cost of our hardware components  partially offset by an increase in inventory write downs 
services gross margin was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal these increased service gross margins were a result of increased productivity resulting from attainment of economies of scale 
services headcount increased to at january   from at january   which was an increase of over the services headcount of at january  the fiscal headcount increase includes employees added as a result of the nutech acquisition

general and administrative expenses increased million  or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses of million in fiscal over fiscal was due primarily to increases of million in salaries and benefits  million in audit  tax  legal  insurance and consulting costs and million in stock based compensation expense 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of million in fiscal over fiscal was due primarily to increases of million in audit  tax  legal  insurance and consulting costs  all of which increased as a result of becoming a public company  million in stock based compensation expense and million in salaries and benefits 
the number of general and administrative employees increased to at january   which includes as a result of the nutech acquisition  from at january  and at january  to ensure we had appropriate infrastructure to support the growth of our organization and to support the additional demands of public company compliance 
interest income and interest expense we recorded million of interest income  net in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million of interest expense  net in fiscal interest income  net for fiscal was comprised of interest income of million and million of net realized gains on the sale of marketable securities 
the components of interest income  net for fiscal were interest income of million  net realized gains on the sale of marketable securities of million and interest expense of million 
the components of interest expense  net for fiscal were interest expense of million and interest income of million 
interest income increased million for fiscal over fiscal  primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances  partially offset by lower rates of return as compared to fiscal the increase in our average cash and investment balances was due primarily to cash generated from operations 
we do expect significant realized gains or losses on investments in fiscal other income expense  net we incurred other expense  net of million in fiscal as compared to other income  net of million in fiscal and other income  net of million in fiscal 
table of contents the components of other expense  net  for fiscal included million of transaction losses for activities in our foreign subsidiaries  and a million gain associated with changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts and other income 
in addition  during the year ended january   we recorded in other income expense  net a net loss on investments of million  which reflects a loss of million due to other than temporary impairments on marketable securities and a gain of million realized on a put right received from one of our investment brokers in november the components of other income  net  for fiscal were million of gains on the translation of non us dollar transactions into us dollars for activities in our foreign subsidiaries  partially offset by million expense from the mark to market adjustments on preferred stock warrants and million of early payoff fees charged to our debt payoff 
as warrants for our preferred stock are no longer outstanding  there will be no mark to market adjustment expense going forward 
the components of other income  net for fiscal were million of gains on the translation of non us dollar transactions into non us dollars for activities in our foreign subsidiaries  partially offset by million expense from the mark to market adjustments on preferred stock warrants 
provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal  as compared to a provision of million for fiscal and for fiscal for the year ended january   our effective tax rate was a benefit of on pre tax income of million  as compared to provisions of and in and on pre tax income of million and loss of million  respectively 
our effective tax rate in fiscal was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of due primarily to i our use in the first half of the year of available nols and research and development tax credits to offset our us taxable income which partially reduced the valuation allowance we had previously recorded against those nols and ii a tax benefit of million recorded in the second half of the year upon our decision in the fourth quarter of fiscal to release a significant portion of the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets  both partially offset by the impact of taxes owed in relation to the income generated by our foreign subsidiaries 
our effective tax rates for the years ended january  and were lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of  due primarily to our use of nols and research and development tax credits to offset our us taxable income which reduced the valuation allowance we had previously recorded against those nols  partially offset by the impact of taxes owed in relation to the income generated by our foreign subsidiaries 
as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal  a full valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets consisting primarily of us net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
however  based upon our operating results over recent years and through january  as well as an assessment of our expected future results of operations  we determined in the fourth quarter of fiscal that it had become more likely than not that we would realize a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets in the us as a result  we reduced our valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of fiscal  which resulted in recognition of a one time income tax benefit of approximately million  a million reserve for uncertain tax positions in the us  which was recorded as a reduction to our tax carryforward attributes  and a million reduction to goodwill for acquired tax benefits as of january   we had a remaining valuation allowance of million against net deferred tax assets in the us of which million was recorded against other comprehensive income and a remaining valuation allowance of million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in the us consisted of capital losses that we have determined are not more likely than not to be realized 
the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards that will likely expire without being utilized 
we anticipate our effective tax rate will increase in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the fact that our nol and tax credit carryforwards had been substantially recognized as of january  resulting in a substantial one time tax benefit in fiscal 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of january   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of million and accounts receivable of million 
since our inception  we have funded our operations using a combination of issuances of convertible preferred stock  which has provided us with aggregate net proceeds of million  cash collections from customers and a term loan credit facility and a revolving credit facility with silicon valley bank 
in july  we raised million of proceeds  net of underwriting discounts and expenses  in our initial public offering 
in the future  we anticipate that our primary sources of liquidity will be cash generated from our operating activities  as our credit facility with silicon valley bank expired as of january  and was not renewed 
our principal uses of cash historically have consisted of payroll and other operating expenses  repayments of borrowings  purchases of property and equipment primarily to support the development of new products and purchases of inventory to support our sales and the volume of evaluation units located at customer locations that enable our customers and prospective customers to test our equipment prior to purchasing 
additionally  we used cash to fund our acquisition of nutech in may the following table shows our cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities for the stated periods fiscal year ended january  in thousands net cash provided by used in  operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities at january   we held ars with a par value totaling million 
these ars  most of which are aaa rated bonds collateralized by federally guaranteed student loans  are long term variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates that are reset through a dutch auction process that typically occurs every to days 
historically  the carrying value par value of the ars approximated fair market value due to the resetting of variable interest rates 
beginning in late february  however  the auctions for ars then held by us were unsuccessful 
as a result  the interest rates on the investments reset to the maximum rate per the applicable investment offering statements 
we will not be able to liquidate the affected ars until a future auction on these investments is successful  a buyer is found outside the auction process  the securities are called or refinanced by the issuer  or the securities mature 
in light of these liquidity issues  we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of these ars investments 
the discounted cash flow analysis we performed considered the timing of expected future successful auctions  the impact of extended periods of maximum interest rates  collateralization of underlying security investments and the creditworthiness of the issuer 
the discounted cash flow analysis performed as of january  assumes a weighted average discount rate of and expected term of three years 
the discount rate was determined using a proxy based upon the current market rates for similar debt offerings within the aaa rated ars market 
the expected term was based on management s estimate of future liquidity 
as a result  we have estimated as of january   an aggregate loss of million  of which million was related to the impairment of ars deemed to be temporary and included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity and of which million was related to the impairment of ars classified as trading securities and included in other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
if we had used a term of one year or five years and a discount rate of and respectively  the gross unrealized loss would have been million or million  respectively 
if we had used a term of three years and a discount rate of or  the gross unrealized loss would have been million or million  respectively 
if we had used a term of three years and illiquidity discounts of or  the gross unrealized loss would have been million or million  respectively 
based on our ability to access our cash and short term investments and our expected cash flows  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these ars will affect our ability to operate our business as usual

table of contents contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of january  less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations including current portion of long term obligations purchase obligations primarily represent the value of purchase orders issued to our contract manufacturer  sanmina  for the procurement of assembled nps appliance systems for the next three months 
the table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of million  the timing of which is uncertain 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on unrecognized income tax benefits 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents of million will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our future operating requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of revenue growth  our expansion of sales and marketing and product development activities 
however  to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents and our cash flow from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements or a secondary public offering 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have during the periods presented  and we do not currently have  any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under sec rules  such as relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  which are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating financing transactions that do not have to be reflected on our balance sheet 
recent accounting pronouncements we adopted the provisions of sfas  on february  for our financial assets and liabilities 
in accordance with the provisions of fasb staff position fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 we deferred the implementation of sfas as it relates to its non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis until february  we are evaluating the impact the deferral of the implementation of sfas will have on our financial statements 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  on february  sfas permits entities to choose  at specified election dates  to measure eligible items at fair value the fair value option 
under this pronouncement  a business entity must report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting period 
we have not elected the fair value option for any items on our balance sheet  except for the put right related to our ars 
in june  the fasb issued fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities fsp eitf 
fsp eitf addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in calculating earnings per share under the two class method described in sfas no

additionally  fsp eitf requires companies to treat unvested share based payment awards that have non forfeitable rights to dividend or dividend equivalents as a separate class of securities in calculating earnings per share and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   early adoption is not permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fsp eitf on our results of operations and earnings per share 

table of contents in april  the fasb issued fsp no

fsp fas amends the factors that should be considered in developing assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  to improve consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset 
fsp fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  and applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
we do not expect the adoption of fsp fas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 business combinations 
sfas r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  requires certain contingent assets and liabilities acquired to be recognized at their fair values on the acquisition date  requires contingent consideration to be recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date and changes in the fair value to be recognized in earnings until settled  requires the expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs  and generally requires the reversals of valuation allowances related to acquired deferred tax assets and changes to acquired income tax uncertainties to also be recognized in earnings 
this accounting standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we expect that the adoption of sfas r will have an effect on how we account for business combinations 
from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb and subsequently adopted by us as of the specified effective date

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our international sales and marketing operations incur expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies 
these expenses could be materially affected by currency fluctuations 
our exposures are to fluctuations in exchange rates for the us dollar versus the british pound  australian dollar  the euro  the canadian dollar  the polish zloty  the korean won and the japanese yen 
changes in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
additionally  our international sales and marketing operations maintain cash balances denominated in foreign currencies 
in order to decrease the inherent risk associated with translation of foreign cash balances into our reporting currency  we have not maintained excess cash balances in foreign currencies 
as of january   we had million of cash in foreign accounts 
we enter into derivative transactions  specifically foreign currency forward contracts  to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that arise  primarily from our foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
the contracts are in british pounds  australian dollars  japanese yen and euros  typically have maturities of one month and require an exchange of foreign currencies for us dollars at maturity of the contracts at rates agreed to at inception of the contracts 
we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
generally  we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes  and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in current earnings 
because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge  any gain or loss on the underlying foreign denominated balance would be offset by the loss or 
table of contents gain on the forward contract 
gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in other income expense  net 
at january   we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of million  denominated in british pounds  australian dollars  japanese yen and euros 
the mark to market effect associated with these contracts was a net unrealized gain of approximately million at january  net realized gains and losses associated with exchange rate fluctuations on forward contracts and the underlying foreign currency exposure being hedged were immaterial for all periods presented 
interest rate risk we had an unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance of million at january   which was held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we do not believe that we have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of these investments as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income  and increases in interest rates may increase future interest expense 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of risk by investing primarily in money market funds  high quality corporate obligations and certificates of deposit 
at january   we held ars with a par value of million that had experienced failed auctions  which has prevented us from liquidating those investments 
as a result  we have classified these investments as long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of january  and recorded an unrealized loss of million related to the impairment of the ars 
see note to the accompanying financial statements for a description of how we value these ars 
our valuation of the ars is sensitive to market conditions and management s judgment and could change significantly based on the assumptions used 
if we had used a term of one year or five years and a discount rate of and respectively  the gross unrealized loss would have been million or million  respectively 
if we had used a term of three years and a discount rate of or  the gross unrealized loss would have been million or million  respectively 
if we had used a term of three years and illiquidity discounts of or  the gross unrealized loss would have been million or million  respectively 
based on our ability to access our cash and short term investments and our expected cash flows  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these ars will affect our ability to operate our business as usual
