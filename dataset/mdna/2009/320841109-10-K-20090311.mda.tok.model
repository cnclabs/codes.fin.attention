item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
the discussion and analysis below includes certain forward looking statements that are subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors described in risk factors under item a and elsewhere in this report that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected in  or implied by  those forward looking statements 
overview we are a provider of insurance products and services to the specialty commercial insurance markets  primarily focusing on niche and underserved segments where we believe that we have underwriting expertise and other competitive advantages 
during our years of underwriting security risks  we have established coverx r as a recognized brand among insurance agents and brokers and have developed significant underwriting expertise and a cost efficient infrastructure 
over the last eight years  we have leveraged our brand  expertise and infrastructure to expand into other specialty classes of business  particularly focusing on smaller accounts that receive less attention from competitors 
first mercury financial corporation fmfc is a holding company for our operating subsidiaries 
our operations are conducted with the goal of producing overall profits by strategically balancing underwriting profits from our insurance subsidiaries with the commissions and fee income generated by our non insurance subsidiaries 
fmfc s principal operating subsidiaries are coverx corporation coverx  first mercury insurance company fmic  first mercury casualty company fmcc  formerly known as all nation insurance company  first mercury emerald insurance services  inc fm emerald  and american management corporation amc 
coverx produces and underwrites insurance policies for which we retain risk and receive premiums 
as a wholesale insurance broker  coverx markets our insurance policies through a nationwide network of wholesale and retail insurance brokers who then distribute these policies through retail insurance brokers 
coverx also provides underwriting services with respect to the insurance policies it markets in that it reviews the applications submitted for insurance coverage  decides whether to accept all or part of the coverage requested and determines applicable premiums 
coverx receives commissions from affiliated insurance companies  reinsurers  and non affiliated insurers as well as policy fees from wholesale and retail insurance brokers 
fm emerald is a wholesale insurance agency producing commercial lines business on primarily an excess and surplus lines basis for coverx via a producer agreement 
as a wholesale insurance agency  fm emerald markets insurance products for coverx through a nationwide network of wholesale and retail insurance brokers who then distribute these products through retail insurance brokers 
fmic and fmcc are two of our insurance subsidiaries 
fmic writes substantially all the policies produced by coverx 
fmcc provides reinsurance to fmic 
effective january   fmic and fmcc entered into an intercompany pooling reinsurance agreement wherein all premiums  losses and expenses of fmic and fmcc  including all past liabilities  are combined and apportioned between fmic and fmcc in accordance with fixed percentages 
fmic also provides claims handling and adjustment services for policies produced by coverx and directly written by third parties 
on june   the company sold all of the outstanding capital stock of american risk pooling consultants  inc arpco 
the results of arpco s operations are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income 
arpco provided third party administrative services for risk sharing pools of governmental entity risks  including underwriting  claims  loss control and reinsurance services 
arpco was solely a fee based business and received fees for these services and commissions on excess per occurrence insurance placed in the commercial market with third party companies on behalf of the pools 
on february   we acquired of the issued and outstanding common stock of american management corporation 
amc is a managing general agency writing primarily commercial lines package policies focused primarily on the niche fuel related marketplace 
amc distributes these insurance policies through a nationwide distribution system of independent general agencies 
amc underwrites these policies for third party 
table of contents insurance carriers and receives commission income for its services 
amc also provides claims handling and adjustment services for policies produced by amc and directly written for third parties 
in addition  amc owns and operates american underwriters insurance company auic  a single state  non standard auto insurance company domiciled in the state of arkansas  and amc re  inc amc re  a captive reinsurer incorporated under the provisions of the laws of arkansas 
effective july   fmic and auic entered into an intercompany reinsurance agreement wherein all premiums and losses of auic  including all past liabilities  are assumed by fmic 
premiums produced we use the operational measure premiums produced to identify premiums generated from insurance policies sold through our underwriting platforms  including coverx  on insurance policies that it produces and underwrites on behalf of our insurance subsidiaries and under fronting relationships 
premiums produced includes both our direct written premiums and premiums directly written by our fronting insurers  all of which are produced and underwritten by our underwriting platforms  including coverx 
although the premiums billed by us under fronting relationships are directly written by the fronting insurer  we control the ultimate placement of those premiums  by either assuming the premiums by our insurance subsidiaries or arranging for the premiums to be ceded to third party reinsurers 
the operational measure premiums produced is used by our management  reinsurers  creditors and rating agencies as a meaningful measure of the dollar growth of our underwriting operations because it represents the premiums that we control by directly writing insurance and by our fronting relationships 
it is also a key indicator of our insurance underwriting operations revenues  and is the basis for broker commission expense calculations in our consolidated income statement 
we generate direct and net earned premium income from premiums directly written by our insurance subsidiaries  and generate commission income  profit sharing commission income and assumed written and earned premiums from premiums directly written by third party insurance companies 
we believe that premiums produced is an important operational measure of our insurance underwriting operations  and refer to it in the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of our operations 
gaap and non gaap financial performance metrics throughout this report  we present our operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful  useful  and transparent to anyone using this financial information to evaluate our performance 
in addition to the gaap generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america presentation of net income and certain statutory reporting information  we show certain non gaap financial measures that we believe are valuable in managing our business and drawing comparisons to our peers 
these measures are gross premiums written  net premiums written  and combined ratio 
following is a list of non gaap measures found throughout this report with their definitions  relationships to gaap measures  and explanations of their importance to our operations gross premiums written while net premiums earned is the related gaap measure used in the statements of earnings  gross premiums written is the component of net premiums earned that measures insurance business produced before the impact of ceding reinsurance premiums  but without respect to when those premiums will be recognized as actual revenue 
we use this measure as an overall gauge of gross business volume in our insurance underwriting operations with some indication of profit potential subject to the levels of our retentions  expenses  and loss costs 
net premiums written while net premiums earned is the related gaap measure used in the statements of earnings  net premiums written is the component of net premiums earned that measures the difference between gross premiums written and the impact of ceding reinsurance premiums  but without respect to when those premiums will be recognized as actual revenue 
we use this measure as an indication of retained or net business volume in our insurance underwriting operations 
it is an indicator of future earnings potential subject to our expenses and loss costs 

table of contents combined ratio this ratio is a common industry measure of profitability for any underwriting operation  and is calculated in two components 
first  the loss ratio is losses and settlement expenses divided by net premiums earned 
the second component  the expense ratio  reflects the sum of policy acquisition costs and insurance operating expenses  net of insurance underwriting commissions and fees  divided by net premiums earned 
the sum of the loss and expense ratios is the combined ratio 
the difference between the combined ratio and reflects the per dollar rate of underwriting income or loss 
for example  a combined ratio of implies that for every of premium we earn  we record of pre tax underwriting income 
critical accounting policies the critical accounting policies discussed below are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require us to exercise significant judgment 
we use significant judgments concerning future results and developments in making these critical accounting estimates and in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of material contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on a continual basis using information that we believe to be relevant 
actual results may differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  and revenues and expenses reported for the periods then ended 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
material estimates that are susceptible to significant change in the near term relate primarily to the determination of the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses and valuation of investments and intangible assets 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses represent our estimated ultimate costs of all reported and unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at the balance sheet date 
our reserves reflect our estimates at a given time of amounts that we expect to pay for losses that have been reported  which are referred to as case reserves  and losses that have been incurred but not reported and the expected development of losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses on reported cases  which are referred to as ibnr reserves 
we do not discount the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
we allocate the applicable portion of our estimated loss and loss adjustment expense reserves to amounts recoverable from reinsurers under ceded reinsurance contracts and report those amounts separately from our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as an asset on our balance sheet 
the estimation of ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses is an inherently uncertain process  requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments 
our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability  but are our estimates based upon various factors  including actuarial projections of what we  at a given time  expect to be the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims reflecting facts and circumstances then known  estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency  assessment of asserted theories of liability  and analysis of other factors  such as variables in claims handling procedures  economic factors  and judicial and legislative trends and actions 
most or all of these factors are not directly or precisely quantifiable  particularly on a prospective basis  and are subject to a significant degree of variability over time 
in addition  the establishment of loss and loss adjustment 
table of contents expense reserves makes no provision for the broadening of coverage by legislative action or judicial interpretation or for the extraordinary future emergence of new types of losses not sufficiently represented in our historical experience or which cannot yet be quantified 
accordingly  the ultimate liability may be more or less than the current estimate 
the effects of changes in the estimated reserves are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimate is revised 
our reserves consist of reserves for property and liability losses  consistent with the coverages provided for in the insurance policies directly written or assumed by the company under reinsurance contracts 
in many cases  several years may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of the loss 
although we believe that our reserve estimates are reasonable  it is possible that our actual loss experience may not conform to our assumptions and may  in fact  vary significantly from our assumptions 
accordingly  the ultimate settlement of losses and the related loss adjustment expenses may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements 
we continually review our estimates and adjust them as we believe appropriate as our experience develops or new information becomes known to us 
when a claim is reported to us  our claims department completes a case basis valuation and establishes a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment as soon as practicable after receiving notice of a claim and after it has sufficient information to form a judgment about the probable ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with that claim 
we take into consideration the facts and circumstances for each claim filed as then known by our claims department  as well as actuarial estimates of aggregate unpaid losses and loss expenses based on our experience and industry data  and expected future trends in loss costs 
the amount of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense for reported claims  which we refer to as case reserves  is based primarily upon a claim by claim evaluation of coverage  and an evaluation of the following factors the type of loss  the severity of injury or damage  our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim  jurisdiction of the occurrence  policy provisions related to the claim  expenses intended to cover the ultimate cost of settling claims  including investigation and defense of lawsuits resulting from such claims  costs of outside adjusters and experts  and all other expenses which are identified to the case  and any other information considered pertinent to estimating the indemnity and expense exposure presented by the claim 
our claims department updates their case basis valuations continuously to incorporate new information 
we also use actuarial analyses to estimate both the costs of losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses that have been incurred but not reported to us and the expected development of costs of losses and loss adjustment expenses on reported cases 
we determine ibnr reserve estimates separately for our security  specialty  contract underwriting  and fm emerald classes 
for security classes  our ibnr reserve estimates are determined using our actual historical loss and loss adjustment expense experience and reporting patterns from our loss and loss adjustment expense database which covers the last years 
for specialty  for which we have eight years of historical data  our estimates give significant weight to industry loss and loss adjustment expense costs  industry reporting patterns applicable to our classes in combination with our actual paid and incurred loss and loss adjustment expense reporting patterns 
for contract underwriting and fm emerald for which we have three years or less of historical data  our estimates give significant weight to industry loss and loss adjustment expense costs  industry reporting patterns applicable to our classes  and historical data when available in combination with our actual paid and incurred loss and loss adjustment expense reporting patterns 
our estimates also include estimates of future trends that may affect the frequency of claims and changes in the average cost of potential future claims 

table of contents we also estimate bulk reserves for our unallocated loss adjustment expenses not specifically identified to a particular claim  namely our internal claims department salaries and associated general overhead and administrative expenses associated with the adjustment and processing of claims 
these estimates  which are referred to as ulae reserves  are based on internal cost studies and analyses reflecting the relationship of unallocated loss adjustment expenses paid to actual paid and incurred losses 
we select factors that are applied to case reserves and to ibnr reserve estimates in order to estimate the amount of unallocated loss reserves applicable to estimated loss reserves at the balance sheet date 
our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses at december    and  gross and net of ceded reinsurance were as follows december  dollars in thousands gross case reserves ibnr and ulae reserves total reserves net of reinsurance case reserves ibnr and ulae reserves total we utilize accepted actuarial methods to arrive at our loss and loss adjustment expense ibnr reserve estimates 
the determination of our best estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses and ibnr reserves requires significant actuarial analysis and judgment  both in application of these methods and in the use of the results of these methods 
the principal methods we use include the loss development method based on paid and reported losses and loss adjustment expenses and loss and loss adjustment expense reporting and payment and reporting patterns  and the bornhuetter ferguson method based on paid and reported losses and loss adjustment expenses  expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios  and loss and loss adjustment expense reporting and payment and reporting patterns  and the cape cod method expected losses for one accident year being estimated based on the loss results for the other accident years  trended to the level of the accident year being estimated  and the expected loss ratio method based on historical or industry experience  adjusted for changes in premium rates  coverage restrictions and estimated loss cost trends  and the frequency severity method based on reported and anticipated claim counts and projected average claim severities 
our estimates give different weight to each of these methods based upon the amount of historical experience data we have and our judgments as to what method will result in the most accurate estimate 
the application of each method for our various classes may change in the future if we determine a different emphasis for each method would result in more accurate estimates 
we apply these methods to net paid and incurred loss and loss adjustment expense and net earned premium information after ceding reinsurance to determine ultimate net loss and loss adjustment expense and net ibnr reserves 
we determine our ceded ibnr reserves applicable to quota share reinsurance based on the ultimate net loss and loss adjustment expense ratios determined in the estimation of our net ibnr reserves 
ceded ibnr reserves applicable to excess of loss reinsurance are based on industry and company experience factors applicable to the excess coverage layers 
ceded case reserves are allocated based on monthly or quarterly reinsurance settlement reports prepared in accordance with the reporting and settlement terms of the ceded reinsurance contracts 

table of contents for security classes where we have many years of historical experience data  we perform semi annual analyses of the payment and reporting patterns of losses and loss adjustment expenses as well as reported and closed claims by accident year for security guard  alarm  and safety equipment sub classes 
we have generally relied primarily on the loss development method in calculating ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses for the more mature accident years  applying our historical loss and loss adjustment expense reporting patterns to paid and incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reported to date by accident year to estimate ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense and ibnr reserves 
our reserve estimates for the more recent  less mature accident years have relied more on the bornhuetter ferguson and cape cod methods to calculate ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense and ibnr reserves 
although we have calculated the results from the expected loss ratio method for the less mature years  we have not relied significantly on this method due to the more meaningful results of the other methods we have used for security classes 
for the specialty  contract underwriting and fm emerald classes  we have relied primarily on the bornhuetter ferguson method in calculating our semi annual reserve estimates 
although we use the loss development method  we have not relied significantly on it as we are still building our experience database 
we have also used the expected loss ratio method  which we have developed from industry loss cost information  adjusted for changes in premium rates  coverage restrictions  and estimated loss cost trends 
our reserve analysis determines an actuarial point estimate rather than a range of reserve estimates 
we do not compute estimated ranges of loss reserves 
we review loss and loss adjustment expense reserves on a quarterly basis 
actuarial loss reserves analyses and reports are prepared and are reviewed by management for all business classes and accident years on a semi annual basis as of june and december annual actuarial statements of opinion on the reserves of our insurance subsidiaries are also prepared as of december  in accordance with insurance regulatory requirements 
the carried reserves reflect management s best estimate of the outstanding losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities after review of the actuarial analyses and statements of actuarial opinion 
during the first two quarters of an accident year  for all classes  we have used the expected loss ratio method based on the previous year end estimates for the previous accident year  adjusted for estimated changes in premium rates  coverage restrictions and estimated loss cost trends 
we monitor emerging loss experience monthly and make adjustments to the current accident year expected loss ratio as we believe appropriate 
throughout the year we also compare actual emerging loss development on prior accident years to expected loss development included in our prior accident years loss reserve estimates and make quarterly interim adjustments to prior years reserve estimates during interim reporting periods as we believe appropriate 
our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability  but are estimates 
although we believe that our reserve estimates are reasonable  it is possible that our actual loss experience may not conform to our assumptions 
the most significant assumptions affecting our ibnr reserve estimates are expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios  and expected loss and loss adjustment expense reporting patterns 
these vary by underwriting class  sub classes  and accident years  and are subject to uncertainty and variability with respect to any individual accident year and sub class 
generally  the reserves for the most recent accident years depend heavily on both assumptions 
the most recent accident years are characterized by more unreported losses and less information available for settling claims  and have more inherent uncertainty than the reserve estimates for more mature accident years 
the more mature accident years depend more on expected loss and loss expense reporting patterns 
the following sensitivity analysis represents reasonably likely levels of variability in these assumptions in the aggregate 
individual classes and sub classes and accident years have different degrees of variability in both assumptions and it is not reasonably likely that each assumption for each sub class and accident year would vary in the same direction and to the same extent in the same reporting period 
we believe the most meaningful approach to the sensitivity analysis is to vary the ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense estimates that result from application of the assumptions 
we apply this approach on an accident year basis  reflecting the reasonably likely differences in variability by level of maturity of the underlying loss experience for each accident year  using variability factors of plus or minus for the most recent accident year  for the preceding accident year  and for the second 
table of contents preceding accident year 
this parameterization of the sensitivity analysis corresponds to the relative uncertainty  by accident year  of our reserve estimates 
the following table includes net ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense amounts by accident year from our statutory filing for our insurance subsidiaries for the year ended december   which are equal to the net ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense amounts by accident year included in our loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates in the consolidated financial statements at december  the use of net of ceded reinsurance amounts is most meaningful since the vast majority of our ceded reinsurance is on a quota share basis 
we have applied the sensitivity factors to each accident year amount and have calculated the amount of potential net reserve change and the impact on reported pre tax income and on net income and stockholders equity at december  we do not believe it is appropriate to sum the illustrated amounts as it is not reasonably likely that each accident year s reserve estimate assumptions will vary simultaneously in the same direction to the full extent of the sensitivity factor

premiums are recognized as earned using the daily pro rata method over the terms of the policies 
when premium rates change  the effect of those changes will not immediately affect earned premium 
rather  those changes will be recognized ratably over the period of coverage 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written that relate to the unexpired terms of policies in force 
as policies expire  we audit those policies comparing the estimated premium rating units that were used to set the initial premium to the actual premiums rating units for the period and adjust the premiums accordingly 
premium adjustments identified as a result of these audits are recognized as earned when identified 
commissions and fees 
wholesale agency commissions and fee income from unaffiliated companies are earned at the effective date of the related insurance policies produced or as services are provided under the terms of the service provider contracts 
related commissions to retail agencies are concurrently expensed at the effective date of the related insurance policies produced 
profit sharing commissions due from certain insurance companies  based on losses and loss adjustment expense experience  are earned when determined and communicated by the applicable insurance company 
investments our marketable investment securities  including money market accounts held in our investment portfolio  are classified as available for sale and  as a result  are reported at market value 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which resulted in no material changes in valuation techniques we previously used to measure fair values 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description 
a decline in the market value of any security below cost that is deemed other than temporary is charged to earnings and results in the establishment of a new cost basis for the security 
in most cases  declines in market value that are deemed temporary are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of the related taxes  until realized 
the exception to this rule relates to investments in convertible 
table of contents securities with embedded derivatives and our alternative investments 
convertible securities were accounted for under fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments sfas for the years ended december  and december  alternative investments consist of our investments in limited partnerships  which invest in high yield convertible securities and distressed structured finance products 
these alternative investments are accounted for under fasb statement no 
 the fair value option of financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  for the year ended december  there were no alternative investments for the year ended december  premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related debt security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
realized gains and losses are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold 
impairment of investment securities impairment of investment securities results in a charge to operations when a market decline below cost is other than temporary 
management regularly reviews our fixed maturity securities portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of investments 
factors considered in evaluating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  the current fair value as compared to cost or amortized cost of the security  as appropriate  the length of time the investment has been below cost or amortized cost and by how much  our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  specific credit issues related to the issuer and current economic conditions 
other than temporary impairment losses result in a permanent reduction of the cost basis of the underlying investment 
significant changes in the factors we consider when evaluating investments for impairment losses could result in a significant change in impairment losses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
as mentioned above  the company considers its intent and ability to hold a security until the value recovers as part of the process of evaluating whether a security s unrealized loss represents an other than temporary decline 
the company s ability to hold such securities is supported by sufficient cash flow from its operations and from maturities within its investment portfolio in order to meet its claims payment and other disbursement obligations arising from its underwriting operations without selling such investments 
with respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the security s value is not written down  a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss 
subsequent decisions on security sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring  changing information and market conditions 
management of the company s investment portfolio is outsourced to third party investment managers  which is directed and monitored by the investment committee 
while these investment managers may  at a given point in time  believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered  the dynamic nature of the portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell the security and realize the loss  based upon a change in market and other factors described above 
the company believes that subsequent decisions to sell such securities are consistent with the classification of the company s portfolio as available for sale 
investment managers are required to notify management of rating agency downgrades of securities in their portfolios as well as any potential investment valuation issues at the end of each quarter 
investment managers are also required to notify management  and receive prior approval  prior to the execution of a transaction or series of related transactions that may result in a realized loss above a certain threshold 
additionally  investment managers are required to notify management  and receive approval  prior to the execution of a transaction or series of related transactions that may result in any realized loss up until a certain period beyond the close of a quarterly accounting period 
deferred policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs related to direct and assumed premiums consist of commissions  underwriting  policy issuance  and other costs that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business  and 
table of contents are deferred  subject to ultimate recoverability  and expensed over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
investment income is included in the calculation of ultimate recoverability 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets that are not subject to amortization shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test for goodwill shall consist of a comparison of the fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit to which it is assigned 
the impairment test for intangible assets shall consist of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible assets with their carrying amounts 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill or intangible assets exceed their fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the carrying value of long lived assets  including amortizable intangibles and property and equipment  are evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred relative to a given asset or assets 
impairment is deemed to have occurred if projected undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
the estimated cash flows include management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations 
the amount of the impairment loss recognized is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its then estimated fair value

commissions and fees year ended december  change dollars in thousands insurance underwriting commissions and fees insurance services commissions and fees total commissions and fees 
table of contents insurance underwriting commissions and fees decreased million or from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this was primarily the result of decreases in commissions on fronted programs 
net investment income and net realized gains on investments during the year ended december   net investment income earned was million  a million  or  increase from million reported during the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the increase in invested assets over the period 
at december   invested assets were million  a million or increase over million of invested assets at december  due to increases in net written premiums and proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities 
net investment income earned continued to benefit from higher reinvestment rates as proceeds from maturing bonds were reinvested at currently higher interest rates

during the year ended december   net realized gains were million  a million  or  increase over the net realized gain of million during the year ended december  the net realized gains were due to mark to market increases of million in convertible bonds carried at market in accordance with sfas offset by net realized losses of million on available for sale securities 
operating expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred during the year ended december  increased by approximately million  or  over the year ended december  this increase reflects the growth in net exposures applicable to the approximately increase in net earned premiums  and an increase in the accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio due to premium rate and loss cost trends  somewhat offset by favorable development of prior years reserves of million in comparison to unfavorable development of prior years reserves during of million

table of contents interest expense year ended december  change dollars in thousands junior subordinated debentures senior notes total interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  from to this decrease was principally attributable to a decrease of million related to the million senior notes issued in august and repaid in october this decrease was offset by a million increase in interest expense related to the junior subordinated debentures  of which million were issued in december and million were issued in september and an increase of million in the change in fair value of the interest rate swap on junior subordinated debentures as is discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
income taxes our effective tax rates were approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds fmfc 
fmfc is a holding company with all of its operations being conducted by its subsidiaries 
accordingly  fmfc has continuing cash needs for primarily administrative expenses  debt service and taxes 
funds to meet these obligations come primarily from management and administrative fees from all of our subsidiaries  and dividends from our non insurance subsidiaries 
insurance subsidiaries 
the primary sources of our insurance subsidiaries cash are net written premiums  claims handling fees  amounts earned from investments and the sale or maturity of invested assets 
additionally  fmfc has in the past and may in the future contribute capital to its insurance subsidiaries 
the primary uses of our insurance subsidiaries cash include the payment of claims and related adjustment expenses  underwriting fees and commissions and taxes and making investments 
because the payment of individual claims cannot be predicted with certainty  our insurance subsidiaries rely on our paid claims history and industry data in determining the expected payout of claims and estimated loss reserves 
to the extent that fmic  fmcc and auic have an unanticipated shortfall in cash  they may either liquidate securities held in their investment portfolios or obtain capital from fmfc 
however  given the cash generated by our insurance subsidiaries operations and the relatively short duration of their investment portfolios  we do not currently foresee any such shortfall 
no dividends were paid to fmfc by our insurance subsidiaries during the years ended december   or our insurance subsidiaries retained all of their earnings in order to support the increase of their written premiums  and we expect this retention of earnings to continue 
our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by statute as to the amount of dividends that they may pay without the prior approval of their domiciliary state insurance departments 
based on the policyholders surplus and the net income of our insurance subsidiaries as of december   fmic  fmcc and auic may pay dividends in  if declared  of up to million without regulatory approval 
non insurance subsidiaries 
the primary sources of our non insurance subsidiaries cash are commissions and fees  policy fees  administrative fees and claims handling and loss control fees 
the primary uses of our non insurance subsidiaries cash are commissions paid to brokers  operating expenses  taxes and dividends paid to fmfc 
there are generally no restrictions on the payment of dividends by our non insurance subsidiaries  except as may be set forth in our borrowing arrangements 

table of contents cash flows our sources of funds have consisted primarily of net written premiums  commissions and fees  investment income and proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and debt 
we use operating cash primarily to pay operating expenses and losses and loss adjustment expenses and for purchasing investments 
a summary of our cash flows is as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents provided by used in operating activities continuing operations operating activities discontinued operations investing activities continuing operations investing activities discontinued operations financing activities continuing operations change in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december  was primarily from cash received on net written premiums and less cash disbursed for operating expenses and losses and loss adjustment expenses

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december  was primarily from cash received on net written premiums and less cash disbursed for operating expenses and losses and loss adjustment expenses 
cash received from net written premiums for the years ended december  and was retained on a funds withheld basis in accordance with the company s from january  through march   from april  through december   from january  through september   and from october  through december   quota share reinsurance contracts 
net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations for the years ended december   and was primarily from cash received on commissions and service fees less cash disbursed for operating expenses 
for  net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations totaled million  and was primarily invested in short term  debt and equity securities and for the acquisition of amc 
the million decrease in net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was a result of million less cash available from financing activities  a million increase due to investments acquired from the amc acquisition  and an increase of million in change in cash and cash equivalents

net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations for the year ended december  was from cash received on the sale of arpco less cash disbursed for transaction costs 

table of contents there were no cash flows from investing activity from discontinued operations for the years ended december  and for  net cash used in financing activities resulted from the issuance of common stock as a result of the exercise of stock options and cash retained from the excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation  offset by the repurchase of common stock under the company s share repurchase program and the purchase of common stock by the company to be held in a rabbi trust for the benefit of the company s supplemental executive retirement plan 
for  the million of net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from the issuance of common stock in a secondary offering discussed below as well as from proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities discussed below 
for  the million of net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the proceeds from our initial public offering  offset by the repurchase of common stock and the retirement of the senior notes 
based on historical trends  market conditions  and our business plans  we believe that our existing resources and sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future 
because economic  market and regulatory conditions may change  however  there can be no assurances that our funds will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs 
in addition  competition  pricing  the frequency and severity of losses  and interest rates could significantly affect our short term and long term liquidity needs 
initial public offering we completed our initial public offering of common stock on october  in which we sold  shares of common stock for million 
in connection with the offering  on october   we repurchased all of our outstanding senior notes for million  paid the holder of our convertible preferred stock million pursuant to the terms of our convertible preferred stock  which was also converted into common stock in connection with the initial public offering  and repurchased  shares of common stock 
we used the remaining million of the net proceeds from the initial public offering  along with available cash of million  to make a million contribution to the capital of fmic in october secondary offering on may   the company filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission for the purpose of making a follow on offering of common stock 
the company s registration statement was declared effective on june  upon completion of the follow on offering on june   gross proceeds from the sale of  shares of common stock  including  shares of common stock sold to the underwriters of the offering pursuant to the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option  at an offering price per share of  totaled million 
costs associated with the follow on offering included million of underwriting costs and million of other issuance costs 
long term debt senior notes 
we had million aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding  which were issued by holdings in august in connection with the holdings transaction 
the senior notes were set to mature on august   and bore interest at an annual rate  reset quarterly  equal to the three month libor plus 
interest was payable quarterly with million of interest paid during the year ended december  on october   we repurchased all of the outstanding senior notes for million  including accrued interest of million and a prepayment penalty of million 
junior subordinated debentures 
we have million cumulative principal amount of floating rate junior subordinated debentures outstanding  million of which were issued in september the debentures were issued in connection with the issuance of trust preferred stock by our wholly owned  non consolidated trusts 
cumulative interest on million of the cumulative principal amount of the debentures is payable quarterly in arrears at a variable annual rate  reset quarterly  equal to the three month libor plus for million  the 
table of contents three month libor plus for million  and the three month libor plus for million principal amount of the debentures 
cumulative interest on million of the cumulative principal amount of the debentures is payable quarterly in arrears at a fixed annual rate of through december   and a variable annual rate  reset quarterly  equal to the three month libor plus thereafter 
for our floating rate junior subordinated debentures  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to pay a fixed rate of interest 
see derivative financial instruments for further discussion 
at december   the three month libor rate was 
we may defer the payment of interest for up to consecutive quarterly periods  however  no such deferrals have been made or are expected 
credit facility 
in october  we entered into a credit facility which provided for borrowings of up to million 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at our election as follows i at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the lender s prime rate and the federal funds rate less  each minus  or  ii a rate per annum equal to libor plus an applicable margin which is currently or based on our leverage ratio 
the obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by our material non insurance subsidiaries 
the maturity date of borrowings made under the credit facility is september the credit facility contains covenants which  among other things  restrict our ability to incur indebtedness  grant liens  make investments and sell assets 
the credit facility also has certain financial covenants 
at december   there were no borrowings under the agreement 
we are not required to comply with the financial related covenants until we borrow under the credit facility 
however  at december   the company was in compliance with all of the covenants related to the credit facility 
derivative financial instruments 
financial derivatives are used as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process 
we use interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of million in order to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations with respect to our junior subordinated debentures 
under two of our swap agreements  which expire in august  we pay interest at a fixed rate of  under our other swap agreement  which expires in december  we pay interest at a fixed rate of 
under all three swap agreements  we receive interest at the three month libor  which is equal to the contractual rate under the junior subordinated debentures 
at december   we had no exposure to credit loss on the interest rate swap agreements 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table illustrates our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years dollars in thousands contractual payments by period long term debt interest on long term debt operating lease obligations reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses total the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses payment due by period in the table above are based on the reserve of loss and loss adjustment expenses as of december  and actuarial estimates of expected payout patterns by type of business 
as a result  our calculation of the reserve of loss and loss adjustment expenses payment due by period is subject to the same uncertainties associated with determining the level of the reserve of loss and loss adjustment expenses and to the additional uncertainties arising from the difficulty in predicting when claims  including claims that have been incurred but not reported to us  will be paid 
actual payments of losses and loss adjustment expenses by period will vary  perhaps materially  from the above table to the extent that current estimates of the reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses vary from actual ultimate claims amounts and as a result of 
table of contents variations between expected and actual payout patterns 
see risk factors for a discussion of the uncertainties associated with estimating the reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses 
the above table includes all interest payments through the stated maturity of the related long term debt 
variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on interest rates in effect at december   and  as applicable  the variable rate interest included the effects of our interest rate swaps through the expiration of those swap agreements 
cash and invested assets our invested assets consist of fixed maturity securities  convertible securities  money market funds and alternative investments 
at december   our investments had a market value of million and consisted of the following investments december  market value of portfolio dollars in thousands short term investments us treasuries us agencies municipal bonds corporate bonds high yield bonds mbs passthroughs cmos asset backed securities commercial mbs convertible securities high yield convertible fund structured finance fund preferred stocks common stocks total the following table shows the composition of the investment portfolio by remaining time to maturity at december  actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties 
additionally  the expected maturities of our investments in putable bonds fluctuate inversely with interest rates and therefore may also differ from contractual maturities 
of total average life investment less than one year one to two years two to three years three to four years four to five years five to seven years more than seven years total 
table of contents the primary goals of our investment portfolio are to accumulate and preserve capital  assure proper levels of liquidity  optimize total after tax return subject to acceptable risk levels  provide an acceptable and stable level of current income  and approximate duration match between investments and our liabilities 
in keeping with these goals  we maintain an investment portfolio consisting primarily of high grade fixed income securities 
our investment policy is developed by the investment committee of the board of directors of our insurance companies and is designed to comply with the regulatory investment requirements and restrictions to which our insurance subsidiaries are subject 
we have structured our investment policy to manage the various risks inherent in achieving our objectives 
credit related risk is addressed by limiting minimum weighted average portfolio credit quality to aa  with no more than of the aggregate portfolio being rated bbb or below 
in addition  no more than of the portfolio may be rated non investment grade at time of purchase 
per issue credit limits have been set to limit exposure to single issue credit events 
interest rate risk or duration risk management was tied to the duration of the liability reserves 
the effective duration of the portfolio as of december  is approximately years and the tax effected duration is years 
excluding cash  convertible securities  limited partnerships  and equity the portfolio duration and tax effected duration are years and years  respectively 
the shorter tax effected duration reflects the significant portion of the portfolio in municipal securities 
the annualized investment yield net of investment expenses on total investments was and for december  and december   respectively 
the tax equivalent investment yield was and at december  and december   respectively 
the increase was the result of higher reinvestment yields on new purchases versus maturing bonds 
additionally  we took advantage of wider spreads in the high yield corporate market by making an allocation to this sector 
our investment policy establishes diversification requirements across various fixed income sectors including governments  agencies  mortgage and asset backed securities  corporate bonds  preferred stocks  municipal bonds and convertible securities 
although our investment policy allows for investments in equity securities  we have minimal current exposure and do not have any current plans to add exposure to equities 
convertible securities are utilized as a means of achieving equity exposure with lower long term volatility than the broad equity market while having the added benefit of being treated as bonds from a statutory perspective 
we utilize five investment managers  each with its own specialty 
each of these managers has authority and discretion to buy and sell securities subject to guidelines established by our investment committee 
management monitors the investment managers as well as our investment results with the assistance of an investment advisor that has been advising us since early our investment advisor is independent of our investment managers and the funds in which we invest 
each manager is measured against a customized benchmark on a monthly basis 
investment performance and market conditions are continually monitored 
the investment committee reviews our investment results at a minimum quarterly 
the majority of our portfolio consists of aaa or aa rated securities with a standard and poor s weighted average credit quality for our aggregate fixed income portfolio of aa at december  the majority of the investments rated bbb and below are convertible securities and high yield corporate fixed income securities 
consistent with our investment policy  we review any security if it falls below bbb and assess whether it should be 
table of contents held or sold 
the following table shows the ratings distribution of our fixed income portfolio as of december  as a percentage of total market value 
of total s p rating investments aaa aa a bbb bb b c nr total the company invests in residential collateralized mortgage obligations cmo that typically have high credit quality  offer good liquidity and are expected to provide an advantage in yield compared to us treasury securities 
the company s investment strategy is to purchase cmo tranches which offer the most favorable return given the risks involved 
one significant risk evaluated is prepayment sensitivity 
while prepayment risk either shortening or lengthening of duration and its effect on total return cannot be fully controlled  particularly when interest rates move dramatically  the investment process generally favors securities that control this risk within expected interest rate ranges 
the company does not purchase residual interests in cmo s 
at december   the company held cmo s classified as available for sale with a fair value of million 
approximately of those cmo holdings were guaranteed by or fully collateralized by securities issued by government sponsored enterprises gse such as gnma  fnma or fhlmc 
in addition  at december   the company held million of mortgage backed pass through securities  of which million were issued by one of the gse s and classified as available for sale 
the company held commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs of million  of which are pre vintage  at december  the weighted average credit support adjusted for defeasance of our cmbs portfolio was and comprised mainly of super senior structures 
the average loan to value ratio at origination was 
the average credit rating of these securities was aaa 
the cmbs portfolio was supported by loans that were diversified across economic sectors and geographical areas 
it is not believed that this portfolio exposes the company to a material adverse impact on its results of operations  financial position or liquidity  due to the underlying credit strength of these securities 
the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio included asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations collateralized by sub prime mortgages and alternative documentation mortgages alt a with market values of million and million at december   respectively 
the company defines sub prime mortgage backed securities as investments with weighted average fico scores below alt a securities are defined by above prime interest rates  high loan to value ratios  high debt to income ratios  low loan documentation eg  limited or no verification of income and assets  or other characteristics that are inconsistent with conventional underwriting standards employed by government sponsored mortgage entities 
the average credit rating on these securities at december  was bbb 
the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  included securities issued by numerous municipalities with a total carrying value of million 
approximately million  or  were pre refunded escrowed with treasuries 
approximately million  or  of the securities were enhanced by third party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default excluding those that are pre refunded 
such insurance may result in a rating of aaa being assigned by independent ratings agencies to those securities 
the downgrade of credit ratings of insurers of these securities could result in a corresponding downgrade in the ratings of the securities from aaa to the underlying rating of the respective security without giving effect to the benefit of insurance 
of the total million of insured municipal securities 
table of contents in the company s investment portfolio at december  excluding those that are pre refunded  approximately were rated at a or above  and approximately were rated at aa or above  without the benefit of insurance 
the average underlying credit rating of the entire municipal bond portfolio was aa at december  the company believes that a loss of the benefit of insurance would not result in a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or liquidity  due to the underlying credit strength of the issuers of the securities  as well as the company s ability and intent to hold the securities 
cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash on hand of million at december  the amortized cost  gross unrealized gains and losses  and market value of marketable investment securities classified as available for sale at december  by major security type were as follows gross unrealized amortized cost gains losses market value dollars in thousands debt securities us government securities government agency mortgage backed securities government agency obligations collateralized mortgage obligations and other asset backed securities obligations of states and political subdivisions corporate bonds total debt securities preferred stocks short term investments total at december  the total unrealized loss of all impaired securities totaled million 
this represents approximately of year end invested assets of million 
this unrealized loss position is a function of the purchase of specific securities in a lower interest rate or spread environment than what prevails as of december  some of these losses are due to the increase in spreads of select corporate bonds or structured securities 
we have viewed these market value declines as being temporary in nature 
our portfolio is relatively short as the duration of the core fixed income portfolio excluding cash  convertible securities  limited partnerships and equity is approximately years 
we expect to hold the majority of these temporarily impaired securities until maturity in the event that interest rates do not decline from current levels 
in light of our significant growth over the past months  liquidity needs from the portfolio are minimal 
as a result  we would not expect to have to liquidate temporarily impaired securities to pay claims or for any other purposes 
there have been certain instances over the past year  where due to market based opportunities  we have elected to sell a small portion of the portfolio 
these situations were unique and infrequent occurrences and in our opinion  do not reflect an indication that we do not have the intent and ability to hold these securities until they mature or recover in value 

table of contents the fair value and amount of unrealized losses segregated by the time period the investment had been in an unrealized loss position is as follows at december  less than months greater than months fair value fair value of of investments investments with gross with gross unrealized unrealized unrealized unrealized losses losses losses losses dollars in thousands debt securities us government securities government agency mortgage backed securities government agency obligations collateralized mortgage obligations and other asset backed securities obligations of states and political subdivisions corporate bonds total debt securities preferred stocks total below is a table that illustrates the unrecognized impairment loss by sector 
the increase in spread relative to us treasury bonds was the primary factor leading to impairment for the year ended december  all asset sectors were affected by the overall increase in spreads as can be seen from the table below 
in addition to the general level of rates  we also look at a variety of other factors such as direction of credit spreads for an individual issue as well as the magnitude of specific securities that have declined below amortized cost 
amount of impairment sector at december  dollars in thousands cash equivalents us treasuries us agencies municipal bonds corporate bonds high yield bonds mbs passthroughs cmos asset backed securities commercial mbs convertible securities high yield convertible fund structured finance fund preferred stocks common stocks the most significant risk or uncertainty inherent in our assessment methodology is that the current credit rating of a particular issue changes over time 
if the rating agencies should change their rating on a particular security in our portfolio  it could lead to a reclassification of that specific issue 
the vast majority of our unrecognized impairment losses are investment grade and aaa or aa rated securities 
should the credit quality of individual issues decline for whatever reason then it would lead us to reconsider the classification of that particular security 
within the non investment grade sector  we continue to monitor the particular status of each issue 
should prospects for any one issue deteriorate  we would potentially alter our classification of that particular issue 

table of contents the table below illustrates the breakdown of impaired securities by investment grade and non investment grade as well as the duration that these sectors have been trading below amortized cost 
the average duration of the impairment has been greater than months 
the unrealized loss of impaired securities as a percent of the amortized cost of those securities is as of december  of total total total average unrealized loss of loss amortized cost amortized cost unrealized losses as of amortized cost months dollars in thousands non investment grade investment grade total the majority of these securities are aaa or aa rated 
these issues are continually monitored and may be classified in the future as being other than temporarily impaired 
the largest concentration of temporarily impaired securities is commercial mbs at approximately of the total loss 
these securities are all aaa rated and have been affected primarily by the widening of spreads within this sector and or the general level of interest rates 
the next highest concentration of temporarily impaired securities is corporate bonds at of the total loss 
within corporate bonds are rated investment grade bbb or better  and their temporary impairment results primarily from the widening of credit spreads 
the next highest concentration of temporarily impaired securities is cmos at of the total loss 
within cmos are rated aaa including the of the cmo exposure that is agency issued  and have primarily been affected by the general level of interest rates as well 
for the year ended december   we sold approximately million of market value of fixed income securities excluding convertibles  which were trading below amortized cost while recording a realized loss of million 
this loss represented of the amortized cost of the positions 
these sales were unique opportunities to sell specific positions due to changing market conditions 
these situations were exceptions to our general assertion regarding our ability and intent to hold securities with unrealized losses until they mature or recover in value 
this position is further supported by the insignificant losses as a percentage of amortized cost for the respective periods 
during the year ended december  net realized losses on investments were million compared to net realized gains of million during the year ended december  net realized losses for the year ended december  were principally due to mark to market declines in securities carried at market in accordance with sfas and sfas of approximately million and million of other than temporary impairments 
deferred policy acquisition costs we defer a portion of the costs of acquiring insurance business  primarily commissions and certain policy underwriting and issuance costs  which vary with and are primarily related to the production of insurance business 
deferred policy acquisition costs totaled million  or of unearned premiums net of reinsurance  at december  loss and loss adjustment expense reserves losses and loss adjustment expenses 
we maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate losses under all insurance policies that we write and our loss adjustment expenses relating to the investigation and settlement of policy claims 
the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses represent our estimated ultimate costs of all reported and unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at the balance sheet date 
our reserves reflect our estimates at a given time of amounts that we expect to pay for losses that have been reported  which are referred to as case reserves  and losses that have been incurred but not reported and the expected development of losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses on reported cases  which are referred to as ibnr reserves 
in evaluating whether the reserves are reasonable for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  it is necessary to project future losses and loss adjustment expense payments 
our reserves are carried at the total 
table of contents estimate for ultimate expected losses and loss adjustment expenses 
we do not discount the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
our reserves consist of reserves for property and liability losses  consistent with the coverages provided for in the insurance policies directly written or assumed by us under reinsurance contracts 
in many cases  several years may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of the loss 
the estimation of ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses is an inherently uncertain process  requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments 
our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability  but are estimates 
although we believe that our reserve estimates are reasonable  it is possible that our actual loss experience may not conform to our assumptions and may  in fact  vary significantly from our assumptions 
accordingly  the ultimate settlement of losses and the related loss adjustment expenses may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements 
we continually review our estimates and adjust them as we believe appropriate as our experience develops or new information becomes known to us 
such adjustments are included in current results of operations 
for a further discussion of how we determine our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and the uncertainty surrounding those estimates  see critical accounting policies loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
reconciliation of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses we establish a reserve for both reported and unreported covered losses  which includes estimates of both future payments of losses and related loss adjustment expenses

during  favorable development in our security general liability classes was million  consisting of million in favorable development in accident years  and unfavorable development of million in accident years the favorable development in accident years was primarily in accident year as a result of lower than expected frequency  severity  and incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the unfavorable development in was due to increases in case reserves on a small number of high severity claims based on obtaining new information 
unfavorable development in our specialty general liability classes was million  consisting of million in favorable development in the accident year  and unfavorable development of million principally in accident years the favorable development in accident year was due to lower than expected frequency  severity  and incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the unfavorable development in included three late reported claims received in the fourth quarter of for catastrophe hurricane rita and thunderstorm related losses 
these claims are being contested by lawsuit and involve severe property damage to commercial buildings in port arthur  texas 
the unfavorable development was also due to increases in case reserves on a small number of high severity claims based on obtaining new information 
in addition  these factors caused related increases in estimates of incurred but not reported losses 
favorable development in unallocated loss adjustment expenses was million across multiple accident years 
during  the company experienced approximately million in net prior year reserve development principally in the accident year  offset somewhat by favorable development on prior years unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves 
the development on accident year reserves was concentrated primarily in the safety equipment class as a result of obtaining new information on several high severity cases 
loss development 
below is a table showing the development of our reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for us for report years through the table portrays the changes in the loss and loss adjustment expenses reserves in subsequent years relative to the prior loss estimates based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year  on a gaap basis 
the first line of the table shows  for the years indicated  the net reserve liability including the reserve for incurred but not reported losses as originally estimated 
for example  as of december  it was estimated that million would be a sufficient reserve to settle all claims not already settled that had occurred prior to december   whether reported or unreported to our insurance subsidiaries 
the next section of the table sets forth the re estimates in later years of incurred losses  including payments  for the years indicated 
for example  as reflected in that section of the table  the original reserve of million was re estimated to be million at december  the increase decrease from the original estimate would generally be a combination of factors  including reserves being settled for amounts different from the amounts originally estimated  reserves being increased or decreased for individual claims that remain open as more information becomes known about those individual claims  and more or fewer claims being reported after december  than had been reported before that date 
the cumulative redundancy deficiency represents  as of december   the difference between the latest re estimated liability and the reserves as originally estimated 
a redundancy means that the original estimate was higher than the current estimate for reserves  a deficiency means that the current estimate is higher than the original estimate for reserves 
for example  because the reserves established as of december  at 
table of contents million were reestablished at december  at million  it was re estimated that the reserves which were established as of december  included a million redundancy 
the next section of the table shows  by year  the cumulative amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses paid as of the end of each succeeding year 
for example  with respect to the net losses and loss expense reserve of million as of december  by december  ten years later million actually had been paid in settlement of the claims which pertain to the reserve as of december  information with respect to the cumulative development of gross reserves that is  without deduction for reinsurance ceded also appears at the bottom portion of the table

table of contents factors contributing to the reserve development in the preceding table are as follows during  our insurance subsidiaries experienced significant favorable development of their reserves  reflecting redundancies in that year 
this development was significantly influenced by the police and public officials classes of business which fmic s predecessor organization  first mercury syndicate fms began writing in  and fmic stopped writing in early reported losses and loss adjustment expense emergence in those classes was worse than industry experience  and estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses and related reserves were based on a continuation of the adverse trend and use of industry development factors 
in addition  fms s loss and loss adjustment experience data only went back to fms s formation in  so greater weight was given to industry data compared to our claims experience in establishing ibnr 
as our policies in the accident years matured  the loss trends moderated and ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses emerged lower than the industry data indications 
from through  the reserves gave greater weight to loss development patterns from our historical experience through  and were adjusted for differences between actual and expected development as losses and loss adjustment expenses emerged 
during  a significant amount of adverse development occurred related to accident years through  and our insurance subsidiaries increased their reserves accordingly 
in addition  we increased our reserves applicable to other specialty classes  principally as a result of using updated industry loss development factors  which became available during  in the calculations of ultimate expected losses and reserves on other specialty classes 
during  the company experienced approximately million in net prior year reserve development primarily in the accident year  offset somewhat by favorable development on prior years unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves 
the development on accident year reserves was concentrated primarily in the safety equipment class as a result of obtaining new information on several high severity cases 
during  the company experienced approximately million of favorable development in net prior year reserves primarily in the accident year due to lower than expected loss and allocated loss adjustment expense emergence  offset by unfavorable development on to accident years reserves 
during  the company experienced approximately million of favorable development in net prior year reserves  with million of favorable development in the and accident years due to lower than expected claim frequency along with lower than expected severity  offset somewhat by increases in incurred but not reported reserves in the and prior accident years to reflect anticipated loss development from construction defect exposures 
because the loss table above is prepared on a reported year basis  the million and million in unfavorable net reserve and gross reserve development  respectively  on the december  net and gross reported reserves appears in the applicable reported year that coincides with the related accident years affected and is repeated in each subsequent year through for policies written from the middle of through the present  historical experience for security classes has improved due to the underwriting initiatives taken in response to the deterioration in loss experience for the through accident years  especially in the safety equipment installation and service class 
reinsurance our insurance subsidiaries cede insurance risk to reinsurers to diversify their risks and limit their maximum loss arising from large or unusually hazardous risks or catastrophic events 
additionally  our insurance subsidiaries use reinsurance in order to limit the amount of capital needed to support their operations and to facilitate growth 
reinsurance involves a primary insurance company transferring  or ceding  a portion of its premium and losses in order to control its exposure 
the ceding of liability to a reinsurer does not relieve the obligation of the primary insurer to the policyholder 
the primary insurer remains liable for the entire loss if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement 

table of contents during  we maintained a quota share on all of our business other than our legal professional liability class  for which we maintained a variable to quota share  and our umbrella policies  for which we maintained a quota share 
on december  we elected the cut off termination option available to us on the expiration of our quota share contracts expiring that day in accordance with the termination provisions of these quota share contracts 
as a result  we effectively eliminated the quota share reinsurance on the million unearned premiums as of december  that had been ceded prior to contract expiration 
this amount of previously ceded net unearned premium reserve was returned to the company as a result of the cut off termination election and reported in the company s net earned premiums for the year ended december  during the first four months of  we maintained a quota share on the majority of our business other than our legal professional liability class  for which we maintained a variable to quota share  and our umbrella policies  for which we maintain a quota share

on april   we purchased an additional quota share for the majority of our primary casualty business for a total cession of 
in  we also maintained other quota share reinsurance contracts for our contract underwriting and fm emerald classes of business 
one of these quota share reinsurance contracts was terminated on a cutoff basis during resulting in million of ceded unearned premium being returned to the company 
for the majority of our primary casualty business in  we maintained a million excess of million per occurrence primary security and specialty general liability and million excess of million per occurrence legal professional liability coverage through december  in addition  we purchased quota share reinsurance for umbrella excess policies written in on july   we purchased excess per risk reinsurance for our property business 
these treaties provide coverage of million excess of million per risk 
prior to july   the company purchased a combination of excess per risk and quota share reinsurance that resulted in similar net retention per risk 
in addition on july   the company purchased property catastrophe reinsurance with limits of million excess of million in cumulative net property retentions 
we purchased catastrophe coverage to our one in year event level 
our catastrophe coverage provides for reinstatement of coverage upon a catastrophic event 
we have historically adjusted our level of quota share reinsurance based on our premiums produced and our level of capitalization  as well as our risk appetite for a particular type of business 
we believe that the current reinsurance market for the lines of business that we insure is stable in both capacity and pricing 
in addition  we do not anticipate structural changes to our reinsurance strategies  but rather will continue to adjust our level of quota share and excess of loss reinsurance based on our premiums produced  level of capitalization and risk appetite 
as a result  we believe that we will continue to be able to execute our reinsurance strategies on a basis consistent with our historical and current reinsurance structures

the inability to recover amounts due from reinsurers could result in significant losses to us 
to protect us from reinsurance recoverable losses  fmic seeks to enter into reinsurance agreements with financially strong reinsurers 
our senior executives evaluate the credit risk of each reinsurer before entering into a contract and monitor the financial strength of the reinsurer 
on december   substantially all reinsurance contracts to which we were a party were with companies with am best ratings of a or better 
one reinsurance contract to which we were a party was with a reinsurer that does not carry an am best rating 
for this contract  we required full collateralization of our recoverable via a grantor trust and an irrevocable letter of credit 
in addition  ceded reinsurance contracts contain trigger clauses through which fmic can initiate cancellation including immediate return of all ceded unearned premiums at its option  or which result in immediate collateralization of ceded reserves by the assuming company in the event of a financial strength rating downgrade  thus limiting credit exposure 
on december   there was no allowance for uncollectible reinsurance  as all reinsurance balances were current and there were no disputes with reinsurers

the net amount of recoverables from acic at december  is fully collateralized by a grantor trust and irrevocable letter of credit 
the reinsurance market moves in pricing cycles which are correlated with the primary insurance market 
thus  after experiencing adverse reserve development due to inadequate pricing during the soft market  the amount of capacity in the reinsurance market has decreased 
this has in turn placed upward pressure on reinsurance prices and restricted terms

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the major components of market risk affecting us are credit risk and interest rate risk 
credit risk credit risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the financial condition of a specific debt issuer or a reinsurer 
we address the risk associated with debt issuers by investing in fixed maturity securities that are investment grade  which are those securities rated bbb or higher by standard poor s 
we monitor the financial condition of all of the issuers of fixed maturity securities in our portfolio 
our outside investment managers assist us in this process 
we utilize a variety of tools and analysis as part of this process 
if a security is rated bbb or higher by standard poor s at the time that we purchase it and is then downgraded below bbb while we hold it  we evaluate the security for impairment  and after discussing the security with our investment advisors  we make a decision to either dispose of the security or continue to hold it 
finally  we employ stringent diversification rules that limit our credit exposure to any single issuer or business sector 
we address the risk associated with reinsurers by generally targeting reinsurers with am best financial strength ratings of a or better 
in an effort to minimize our exposure to the insolvency of our reinsurers  we evaluate the acceptability and review the financial condition of each reinsurer annually 
in addition  we continually monitor rating downgrades involving any of our reinsurers 
at december   all reinsurance contracts were with companies with am best ratings of a or better except for two reinsurers with am best ratings of a 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that we may incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
the primary market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through an asset and liability matching process 
in the management of this risk  the characteristics of duration  credit and variability of cash flows are critical elements 
these risks are assessed regularly and balanced within the context of our liability and capital position 
our outside investment managers assist us in this process 
we have million cumulative principal amount of floating rate junior subordinated debentures outstanding 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements through with a combined notional amount of million and through with a notional amount of million in order to fix the interest rate on this debt  thereby reducing our exposure to interest rate fluctuations with respect to our debentures
