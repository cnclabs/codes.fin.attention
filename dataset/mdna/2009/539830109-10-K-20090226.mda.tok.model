we also discuss those items affecting our results that were not considered in senior management s assessment of the operating performance of our business segments 
we separately disclose these items to assist in your evaluation of our overall operating performance and financial condition of our consolidated company 
we would like to draw your attention to the following items disclosed in this financial section and where you will find them topic location s critical accounting policies contract accounting revenue recognition page and page postretirement benefit plans page and page environmental matters page  page and page goodwill page and page stock based compensation page  page and page discussion of business segments page and page liquidity and cash flows page and page capital structure and resources page  page  page and page legal proceedings  commitments and contingencies page and page income taxes page and page industry considerations us government business budget priorities in these times of unprecedented economic uncertainty and market turmoil  developing and implementing spending  tax  and other initiatives to stimulate the faltering economy is at the forefront of the us government s activities 
we expect the new obama administration s decisions regarding defense  homeland security  and other federal spending priorities  and the congress reaction to the administration s proposals  to be balanced with the cost and impact of economic stimulus initiatives  particularly in the longer term 
spending priorities for fiscal year will be announced soon  with submission of a detailed president s budget request for fiscal year and beyond expected by late april or early may of although we believe some priorities will change  many of the investments and acquisitions we have made have been focused on aligning our businesses to address what we believe are the most enduring national imperatives and critical mission areas 
but the possibility remains that one or more of our programs could be reduced  extended  or terminated as a result of the administration s assessment of priorities 
department of defense business the department of defense dod has  for the past eight years  focused on sustainment of current military capabilities and modernization of our armed forces to deter and defeat current and future threats 
the prior administration primarily sought to fund the us military missions in iraq and afghanistan and other unforeseeable contingency or peacekeeping operations through supplemental funding requests 
this supplemental funding enabled the dod to proceed with critical recapitalization and modernization programs in the base budget  rather than using base budget funds available for those programs to pay for the iraq and afghanistan missions and other unforeseen operations 
while we expect to see continued support of such initiatives under the new administration  other national priorities must also be addressed  most notably the current financial crisis 
initiatives to address economic stimulus will compete with other national priorities  such as defense and homeland security 
in this period of transition  we expect the new administration to look broadly across current programs and examine existing resources as part of its assessment of national priorities 
although the ultimate size of future defense budgets remains uncertain  current indications are that overall defense spending will continue to increase over the next few years  albeit at lower rates of growth 
the dod base budget for fiscal year provided mid single digit growth above prior year levels 
current estimates for the budget for fiscal year provide for growth of about to over levels 
the administration s assessment likely will include focus on the level and composition of supplemental budget requests going forward 
although congress has continued to express concern about the size of supplemental budget requests  funding for ongoing operations has not been significantly curtailed by congress to date 
we expect to see continuing pressure to reduce supplemental funding requests 

table of contents we believe our broad mix of programs and capabilities continues to position us favorably to support the current and future needs of the dod 
for example  the need for more affordable logistics and sustainment  expansive use of information technology and knowledge based solutions  and vastly improved levels of network and cybersecurity  all appear to be national priorities 
to meet these changing dynamics  we have been growing our portfolio of expertise  diversifying our business  and expanding systems integration skills into adjacent businesses and programs that include surface naval vessels  rotary wing aviation and land vehicles 
we continue to produce the f raptor for the us air force and will expand production of the c j super hercules tactical airlifter to meet us government and other demand 
we also are preparing for increased production of the f lightning ii joint strike fighter for the us navy  air force  marine corps  and international partners 
in the areas of space based intelligence and information superiority  we have leadership positions on programs such as the global positioning satellite program gps iii  tsat mission operations system tmos  mobile user objective system muos  the advanced extremely high frequency aehf system  the space based infrared system high sbirs h  and classified programs 
our products are represented in almost every aspect of land  sea  air and space based missile defense  including the aegis weapon system program  the patriot advanced capability pac missile program  the terminal high altitude area defense thaad system  the multiple kill vehicle mkv program  and the medium extended air defense system meads 
we continue to perform on contracts to develop and deliver essential munitions  missile  and other systems  such as hellfire  guided multiple launch rocket systems  and eq radar systems  to our warfighters 
we are bringing our systems integration expertise  as well as our existing advanced technology products and services into adjacent military product lines  such as the littoral combat ship  the vh us presidential helicopter  and the joint light tactical vehicle programs 
we also have unmanned systems capabilities  including air  ground  and underwater systems 
in the area of command  control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance cisr programs  our capabilities include the air operations center weapons system integrator  the airborne maritime fixed joint tactical radio system  the warfighter information network tactical  the combatant commanders integrated command and control system  and the global communications support system air force 
we are a significant presence in information technology support and modernization for the dod 
we see opportunities for expansion of our sustainment and logistical support activities to enhance the longevity and cost effectiveness of the systems procured by our customers  and for improving global supply chain management 
we also see opportunities to grow our business in providing global services and business process management for dod needs 
despite the anticipated modest increase in the defense budget  we believe our revenue growth will exceed expected growth in the dod budget 
we expect strong expansion in our f program as we begin low rate production activities and in sales of information technology solutions 
we expect continued growth in our core and adjacent businesses for both domestic and international customers  as we broaden our portfolio and remain committed to excellence in execution 
our revenues have historically not been dependent on supplemental funding requests 
many of our programs require funding over several annual government budget cycles 
there is always an inherent risk that these and other dod programs could become potential targets for future reductions or elimination of funding to pay for other programs  either in the new administration s budget reviews or in the congressional process of annual appropriations 
non department of defense business our experience in the defense arena  together with our core information technology and services expertise  has enabled us to provide products and services to a number of government agencies  including the departments of homeland security  justice  commerce  health and human services  state  transportation and energy  the us postal service  the social security administration  the federal aviation administration  the national aeronautics and space administration nasa  the environmental protection agency epa  the national archives  and the library of congress 
we have continued to expand our capabilities in critical intelligence  knowledge management and e government solutions for our customers  including the social security administration and the epa  as well for the dod 
we also provide program management  business strategy and consulting  complex systems development and maintenance  complete life cycle software support  information assurance and enterprise solutions 
the expected growth in business process outsourcing has been enabled by rule changes for public private competitions 
in addition  recent trends continue to indicate an increase in demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems and solutions 
as a result  we continue to focus our resources in support of infrastructure modernization that allows for interoperability and communication across agencies 

table of contents our recent experiences with non dod agencies have reinforced our strategy of becoming the world s premier global security company 
we have seen the global security environment becoming much more complex and dynamic 
the very definition of security has continued to change 
over and above traditional military preparedness  we have seen and been a part of further expansion into more effective counter terrorism and intelligence capabilities  international cooperation activities requiring more interoperable systems  and humanitarian  peace keeping  and operational stabilization initiatives 
consistent with our dod business  more affordable logistics and sustainment  a more expansive use of information technology and knowledge based solutions  and improved levels of network and cybersecurity  all appear to be priorities in our non dod business as well 
homeland security  critical infrastructure protection  and improved service levels for civil government agencies also appear to be high customer priorities 
the continuing strong emphasis on homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as air traffic management  ports  waterways and cargo security  biohazard detection systems for postal equipment  employee identification and credential verification systems  information systems security  and other global security systems solutions 
in addition  we may see an increase in demand from the department of state and the united nations for mission services  global security and stability operations  and facility services 
we have made disciplined acquisitions and investments to reinforce our presence and skills in the information sciences domain 
we believe expanded access to continuous high quality situational awareness will remain essential in assuring clarity and reducing uncertainty in today s environment 
the very need for this increased situational awareness will drive the linkage of increasingly robust communication systems  advanced sensing devices and the computers that control them 
this capability will enable the meaningful sharing of information and networks will continue to grow in power and importance to accommodate these new linkages 
we also believe the criticality of network security will result in increased demand for cybersecurity  and encryption security solutions 
we expect to be well positioned to meet these growing needs 
the prior administration s budget proposal for fiscal year sought to limit overall growth in the civil agency budgets to one percent per year or less 
similar to spending in the area of defense  civil programs will also have to compete with resource requirements for economic stimulus 
though we expect to see relatively small increases in total non defense discretionary spending in the near term  we believe our key programs will continue to be supported in the budgets of the various agencies with which we do business 
similar to the risks inherent in our defense business  funding for our civil agency business is contingent on approval in annual appropriations for each of the agencies with which we have business 
major programs may be funded over several annual government budget cycles  with the risk of future reductions or elimination in the new administration s budget review or in the annual congressional appropriations process 
in the civil government business  some risks are unique to particular programs 
for example  although indemnification by the us government to cover potential claims or liabilities resulting from a failure of technologies developed and deployed may be available in some instances for our defense businesses  us government indemnification may not be available for homeland security purposes 
in addition  there are some instances where the us government could provide indemnification under applicable law  but elects not to do so 
while we maintain insurance for some business risks  it is not possible to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities 
we generally seek  and in most cases have obtained  limitation of such potential liabilities related to the sale and use of our homeland security products and services through qualification by the department of homeland security under the safety act provisions of the homeland security act of safety act qualification is not available to mitigate potential liability for international applications of our homeland security products and services 
where we are unable to secure indemnification or qualification under the safety act or choose not to do so  we may nevertheless elect to provide the product or service when we think the related risks are manageable or when emergency conditions relative to national security make qualification impractical 
other business considerations we are exposed to risks associated with us government contracting  including technological uncertainties  dependence on fewer manufacturing suppliers  and obsolescence  as well as congressional appropriation and allotment of funds each year 
many of our programs involve the development and application of state of the art technologies aimed at achieving challenging goals 
as a result  setbacks  delays  cost growth and product failures can occur 
in years in which an appropriations bill has not been signed into law before september the end of the us government s fiscal year  congress typically passes a continuing resolution that authorizes us government agencies to continue to operate  generally at the same funding levels from the prior year  but does not authorize new spending initiatives 

table of contents during periods covered by continuing resolutions or until the regular appropriation bills are passed  we may experience delays in procurement of products and services due to lack of funding  and those delays may affect our revenue and profit during the period 
as a government contractor  we are subject to us government oversight 
the government may ask about and investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations 
depending on the results of those audits and investigations  the government could make claims against us 
under government procurement regulations and practices  an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and suspended from being able to bid on  or be awarded  new government contracts for a period of time 
a conviction could result in debarment for a specific period of time 
similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business 
although we cannot predict the outcome of these types of investigations and inquiries with certainty  based on current facts  we believe the probability is remote that any of the claims  audits or investigations pending against us will have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
we have entered into various joint ventures  teaming and other business arrangements to help support our portfolio of products and services in many of our lines of business  and their activities are closely aligned with our operations 
for example  we have a equity interest in united launch alliance  llc ula  which provides the production  engineering  test and launch operations associated with us government launches on atlas and delta launch vehicles  and a equity interest in united space alliance  llc usa  which provides ground processing and other operational services to the space shuttle program 
in some cases  we form joint ventures with one or more other contractors for the purpose of pursuing a bid for a particular contract and  if successful  the joint venture serves as the prime contractor under that contract 
in those instances  the work under contract is performed by subcontractors to the joint venture including  but not limited to  the joint venture investors 
we generally limit our exposure under these arrangements to our investment in the venture  which is typically not material  and to the performance of our obligations under the subcontract 
in some cases  we guarantee contractual performance by the venture  but are generally cross indemnified by the other venture participants to the extent of their contractual performance obligations 
we remain committed to growth in our sales to international customers 
those customers  similar to our us government customers  have been affected by the global economic crisis 
we expect their decisions regarding defense and security spending will also compete with their own economic stimulus initiatives 
we conduct business with foreign governments primarily through electronic systems and aeronautics 
our international sales are composed of foreign military sales through the us government and direct commercial contracts 
with regard to the aegis weapon system  our electronic systems segment performs activities in the development  production  ship integration and test  and lifetime support for ships of international customers eg  japan  spain  korea  norway  and australia 
this segment also was awarded two contracts by the canadian government for the upgrade and support of combat systems on halifax class frigates and iroquois class destroyers 
electronic systems produces the pac missile  an advanced defensive missile designed to intercept incoming airborne threats  for international customers including japan  germany  the netherlands and the united arab emirates uae 
in aeronautics  the us government and eight foreign government partners are working together on the design  testing  production and sustainment of the f lightning ii 
the f fighting falcon has been selected by countries  with follow on buys from customers 
we continue to expand the c j super hercules air mobility aircraft s international footprint with customers in nine countries including recent orders from india and qatar 
in global sustainment  we are leveraging our value as the original equipment manufacturer oem for our major platforms and have set up new production capabilities to provide service life extension  including new wings and support for norway s p fleet and the recent awards from the us and canadian governments to upgrade their p aircraft 
is gs  through its subsidiary pacific architects and engineers pae  has increased our presence in certain less developed countries by providing base camp construction  logistics  democratization and management services  among others  generally through our contracts with such customers as the united nations and the us department of state 
in addition  is gs was awarded the contract to provide all data processing for the population census in england  wales and northern ireland for the census  including development of the related system 
to the extent our contracts and business arrangements with international partners include operations in foreign countries  other risks are introduced into our business  including changing economic conditions  fluctuations in relative currency values  regulation by foreign countries and the potential for unanticipated cost increases resulting from the possible deterioration of political relations 
the nature of our international business also makes us subject to the export control 
table of contents regulations of the u 
s 
department of state and the department of commerce 
if these regulations are violated  it could result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges 
we are currently unaware of any violations of export control regulations which are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
critical accounting policies contract accounting revenue recognition approximately of our net sales are derived from long term contracts for design  development and production activities  which are accounted for under the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
our remaining net sales are derived from contracts to provide other services that are not associated with design  development or production activities 
we account for those contracts in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting method for a particular contract 
accounting for design  development and production contracts generally  we record long term  fixed price design  development and production contracts on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing sales 
for example  we use this method of revenue recognition on our c j tactical transport aircraft program and multiple launch rocket system program 
for certain other long term  fixed price design  development and production contracts that  along with other factors  require us to deliver minimal quantities over a longer period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract  sales are recorded when we achieve performance milestones or using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  we recognize sales based on the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion 
as examples  we use this methodology for our f raptor program and the aegis weapon system program 
in some instances  long term production programs may require a significant level of development and or a low rate of initial production units in their early phases  but will ultimately require delivery of increased quantities in later  full rate production stages 
in those cases  the revenue recognition methodology may change from the cost to cost method to the units of delivery method as new contracts for different phases of a program are received after considering  among other factors  program and production stability 
as we incur costs under cost reimbursement type contracts  we record sales and an estimated profit 
cost reimbursement type contracts include time and materials and other level of effort type contracts 
examples of this type of revenue recognition include the f lightning ii joint strike fighter development and low rate initial production contracts  and the thaad missile defense program 
most of our long term contracts are denominated in us dollars  including contracts for sales of military products and services to foreign governments conducted through the us government ie  foreign military sales 
as a general rule  we recognize sales and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost to cost and milestone methods of percentage of completion accounting than when we use the units of delivery method 
in addition  our profits and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long term contracts undertaken  the costs incurred in their performance  the achievement of other performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees  particularly under award and incentive fee contracts  is finally determined 
award fees and incentives related to performance on design  development and production contracts  which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer  as well as penalties related to contract performance  are considered in estimating sales and profit rates 
estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and anticipated performance 
incentive provisions which increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are generally not recognized until the event occurs 
those incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance 
accounting for design  development and production contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
we have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability  the complexity of the 
table of contents work to be performed  the availability of materials  the length of time to complete the contract to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials  performance by our subcontractors  and the availability and timing of funding from our customer  among other variables 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
we have accounting policies in place to address these as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long term contracts 
products and services provided under long term design  development and production contracts represent approximately of our net sales for therefore  the amounts we record in our financial statements using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material 
because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if our underlying circumstances were to change 
for example  if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all design  development and production contracts was higher or lower by one percentage point  our net earnings would increase or decrease by approximately million 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required  any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception to date effect of the changes on current and prior periods 
when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined 
accounting for services contracts revenue under contracts for services other than those associated with design  development or production activities is generally recognized either as services are performed or when a contractually required event has occurred  depending on the contract 
the majority of our services contracts are in our is gs segment  including the automated flight service station contract to provide a network of air traffic facilities and related services  and the u 
s army corps of engineers contract to provide information management and technology services 
services contracts primarily include operations and maintenance contracts and outsourcing type arrangements 
revenue under such contracts is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the period of contract performance  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs incurred under these services contracts are expensed as incurred  except that initial set up costs are capitalized and recognized ratably over the life of the agreement 
earnings related to such services contracts may fluctuate from period to period  particularly in the earlier phases of the contract 
award fees and incentives related to performance on services contracts are recognized when they are fixed and determinable  generally at the date the amount is communicated to us by the customer 
other contract accounting considerations the majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the us government 
cost based pricing is determined under the federal acquisition regulation far 
the far provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under us government contracts 
for example  costs such as those related to charitable contributions  interest expense  and certain advertising and certain public relations activities are unallowable  and therefore not recoverable through sales 
in addition  we may enter into agreements with the us government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters 
for example  most of the environmental costs we incur for groundwater treatment and soil remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under far provisions and supporting agreements reached with the us government 
we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
business segment personnel evaluate our contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews 
also  regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost  scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel independent from the business segment performing work under the contract 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with us government regulations by our personnel  and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 
for other information on accounting policies we have in place for recognizing sales and profits  see our discussion under sales and earnings in note to the financial statements 
postretirement benefit plans most of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans  and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees collectively  postretirement benefit plans see note 
our earnings may be negatively or positively impacted by the amount of expense or income we record for our postretirement benefit plans 
this is 
table of contents particularly true with expense or income for defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions and workforce demographics 
non union represented employees hired after january  do not participate in our qualified defined benefit pension plans  but are eligible to participate in our defined contribution plan and our other retirement savings plans 
they also have the ability to participate in our retiree medical plans  but we do not subsidize the cost of their participation 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans using statement of financial accounting standards fas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  fas  employers accounting for pensions  and fas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
fas requires us to recognize on a plan by plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans as either an asset or liability on our balance sheet  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  in stockholders equity 
the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan 
fas and fas require that the amounts we record  including the expense or income for the plans  be computed using actuarial valuations 
these valuations include many assumptions  including assumptions we make regarding financial market and other economic conditions 
changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions we use 
the primary year end assumptions used to estimate postretirement benefit plan expense or income for the following calendar year are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets for all postretirement benefit plans  the rates of increase in future compensation levels for our defined benefit pension plans  and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans 
the more subjective of these assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we use judgment in reassessing these assumptions each year because we have to consider past and current market conditions  and make judgments about future market trends 
we also have to consider factors like the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants 
the discount rate we select impacts both the calculation of the benefit obligation at the end of the year as well as the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in the subsequent year 
we evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate discount rate 
these items include results from cash flow models  quoted rates from long term bond indices  and changes in long term bond rates over the past year 
as part of our evaluation  we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows 
our postretirement benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated aa or better 
the available universe of bonds is adjusted to reflect call provisions  outstanding issue amount  and bonds that are considered outliers ie bonds with yields too far above or below the mean of the available universe of bonds 
as of december   three actuarial models calculated rates of   and for our qualified defined benefit pension plans 
we also evaluated the annualized merrill lynch index for long term aa corporate bonds years  which was at the close of in general  these data points were to basis points lower than at december  the data we collect provides important inputs into our determination of an appropriate discount rate 
after reviewing all of the above data  we determined that the most appropriate discount rate for lockheed martin as of december  would be between and 
we selected as the discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations at december   compared to used at the end of the impact of the change in the discount rate  together with other factors such as the approximate actual return on plan assets resulting from downward market conditions in  was a noncash  after tax reduction to our stockholders equity at december  of approximately billion 
the negative return on plan assets accounted for over of the decrease in stockholders equity 
in addition  the negative return on plan assets in and the change in the discount rate will increase pension expense to approximately billion  as compared to million in  with approximately of the increase being driven by the negative return on plan assets 
the discount rate assumption we select at the end of each year is based on our best estimates and judgment 
a reasonably possible change of plus or minus basis points in the discount rate assumption at december   with all other assumptions held constant  would decrease or increase the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of by approximately million  resulting in an after tax increase or decrease in stockholders equity at the end of the year of approximately million 
if the discount rate at december  that was used to compute expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been basis points higher or lower  with all other assumptions held constant  the amount of expense projected for would be lower or higher by approximately 
table of contents million 
the results of these scenarios should not be extrapolated to assess other scenarios beyond the basis points  because there is not a direct correlation between a change in the discount rate and the changes in stockholders equity and pension expense 
the long term rate of return assumption represents the expected average rate of earnings on the funds invested  or to be invested  to provide for the benefits included in the plan obligation 
this assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns  the anticipated long term allocation of plan assets  the historical return data for the trust funds  plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns 
the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption  but the average expected return over a long term future horizon should be approximated by the assumption  therefore  changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate 
any variance in a given year should not  by itself  suggest that the assumption should be changed 
patterns of variances are reviewed over time and then combined with expectations for the future 
at december   we concluded that was a reasonable estimate for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption  consistent with the rate used at december  us government cost accounting standards cas are a major factor in determining our pension funding requirements and govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the us government 
funded amounts are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on us government contracts  and therefore are recognized in our net sales 
the total funding requirement for our qualified defined benefit pension plans under cas was million in which was recorded in our segments results of operations 
for  we expect our funding requirements under cas to decrease slightly 
additional funding requirements computed under the internal revenue code irc rules  as well as discretionary payments  are considered to be prepayments under the cas rules to the extent the amounts exceed cas funding requirements 
these amounts would be recorded on our balance sheet and recovered in future periods 
in  and  we made discretionary prepayments of million  million and million to the master retirement trust the master trust related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans 
prepayments reduce the amount of future cash funding that will be required under the cas and irc rules 
the prepayments in prior years were used to fund required contributions in based on our known requirements as of december   we would not expect to make any further required cash contributions to the master trust related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in due to prepayments made in prior years 
due to other events which may occur in  such as pending negotiations for certain collective bargaining agreements  we may decide to make cash contributions in of as much as million to million based on the outcome of those events 
in addition  we may review options for using available cash for further discretionary contributions 
the master trust primarily supports our qualified defined benefit pension plans 
valuation of the assets in the master trust requires judgment relative to the determination of fair value as of december while many of the asset values are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets eg  stock of actively traded public companies  the trustee for the master trust uses various pricing sources to determine fair values for other assets where their value may be based on quoted prices for similar instruments or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets  or amounts derived from valuation models where all significant inputs are based on active markets that can be observed eg  fixed income debt securities 
for still other investments  values may be amounts derived from valuation models where one or more of the significant inputs into the model cannot be observed and which require the development of relevant assumptions eg  private equity funds and investments in real estate partnerships 
the trustee uses brokers  pricing agents  and other pricing sources to assist in the determination of the value for many of the assets  and works closely with their providers to evaluate the accuracy and timeliness of the pricing data they receive 
we review the trustee s policies and procedures regarding pricing of investments  their selection of pricing sources  and the statements we receive from them  in our evaluation of the accuracy and reliability of the pricing data included in the statements 
given the current financial environment  we also assess the potential for adjustment to the fair value of certain investments where there is a lag in the availability of data to support the investment s value eg  private equity funds and real estate partnerships 
in those cases  we may solicit preliminary valuation updates at year end from the funds and partnerships 
we use that information  and corroborating data from public markets  to determine if any adjustments should be recorded in the fair values 
at december   private equity funds and real estate partnerships represented approximately of the total fair value of the master trust 
in august  the president signed into law legislation related to pension plan funding in response to the public s concern over the adequacy of such funding 
the law had the effect of accelerating the required amount of annual pension plan contributions under the irc that most companies are required to pay  beginning in the legislation provides an exemption for us as well as other large us defense contractors that delays the requirement to accelerate funding 
the 
table of contents legislation also requires the cas board to modify its pension accounting rules by to better align the recovery of pension contributions on us government contracts with the new accelerated funding requirements 
the new funding requirements for large us defense contractors will be delayed until the earlier of or the year in which the changes to the cas rules are effective 
environmental matters we are a party to various agreements  proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues  including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the epa or by a state agency 
we account for environmental remediation liabilities in accordance with sop  environmental remediation liabilities 
we enter into agreements eg  administrative orders  consent decrees which document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation 
we are also involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements exist  but do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation 
environmental cleanup activities usually span many years  which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to  for example  changing remediation technologies 
to determine the costs related to cleanup sites  we have to assess the extent of contamination  the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation  and evolving regulatory environmental standards 
we consider these factors in our estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation actions  which generally results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental site 
we record a liability for the amount within the range which we determine to be our best estimate of the cost of remediation or  in cases where no amount within the range is better than another  an amount at the low end of the range 
given the required level of judgment and estimation  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change eg  a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination 
we perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and assets in the period it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated see the discussion under environmental matters in notes and to the financial statements 
at the end of  the total amount of liabilities recorded on our balance sheet for environmental matters was million 
we have recorded assets totaling million at december  for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services to agencies of the us government 
the amount that is expected to be allocated to our commercial businesses or that is determined to be unallowable for pricing under us government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales 
under agreements reached with the us government  most of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs 
under existing government regulations  these and other environmental expenditures relating to our us government business  after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other prps  are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services 
as a result  most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to us government agreement or regulation 
as disclosed above  we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites  which would result in a change to the corresponding environmental asset and a charge to earnings 
for example  if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by million  the corresponding assets would be increased by approximately million  with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings 
this allocation is determined annually  based upon our existing and projected business activities with the us government 
we cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental sites with which we are involved 
there are a number of former operating facilities which we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation 
in some cases  although a loss may be probable  it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties eg  assessing the extent of the contamination 
during any particular quarter  such uncertainties may be resolved to allow us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site 
the amount of the liability could be material 
upon recognition of the liability  a portion will be recognized as an asset with the remainder charged to operations 
if we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a prp  we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable prps 
generally  prps that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share  on an allocated basis  the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation of hazardous materials 
under existing environmental laws  responsible 
table of contents parties are jointly and severally liable and  therefore  we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation 
in the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation  the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of contribution from the other prps 
the amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other prps  which we are required to pursue by agreement and us government regulation 
goodwill in accordance with fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances could include significant changes in the business climate of our industry  operating performance indicators  competition  or sale or disposal of a portion of a reporting unit 
the assessment is performed at the reporting unit level which we generally define as the business segment level or one level below the business segment 
we consider a component of our business to be a reporting unit if it constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
our annual testing date is october performing the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units and the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow methodology which requires significant judgment 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs  based primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  general market conditions  and the determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  we measure impairment by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value  and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period 
our goodwill at december  amounted to billion 
we completed our assessment of goodwill as of october  and determined that no impairment existed at that date 
changes in estimates and assumptions we make in conducting our goodwill assessment could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
however  a decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units at october  would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation under the provisions of fas r  share based payment 
we recognize compensation cost related to all share based payments  including restricted stock units rsus and stock options 
compensation cost for rsus is based on the market value of our common stock on the date of the award 
we estimate the fair value for stock options at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
our stock options do not include market or performance conditions 
we generally recognize the compensation cost for rsus and stock options ratably over a three year vesting period 
the black scholes model requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining certain inputs to the model  including a volatility factor for our stock  an expected life of the option and a risk free interest rate 
we estimate volatility based on the historical volatility of our daily stock price over the past five years  which is commensurate with the expected life of the options 
we base the average expected life on the contractual term of the stock option  historical trends in employee exercise activity and post vesting employment termination trends 
we analyzed the option exercise patterns of our employees and determined there are no significant differences between employee groups 
we base the risk free interest rate on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
we also are required to estimate forfeitures at the date of grant which we base on historical experience 
if any of our estimates or assumptions used in the black scholes model were to change significantly  stock based compensation expense could differ materially in the future from the amount recorded in compensation cost recognized in   and totaled million  million  and million 

table of contents results of operations since our operating cycle is long term and involves many types of design  development and production contracts with varying production delivery schedules  the results of operations of a particular year  or year to year comparisons of recorded sales and profits  may not be indicative of future operating results 
the following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context 
all per share amounts cited in this discussion are presented on a per diluted share basis 
net sales in billions logo the following discussion of operating results provides an overview of our operations by focusing on key elements in our statement of earnings 
the discussion of business segments section which follows describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated net sales and operating profit for  and we follow an integrated approach for managing the performance of our business  and generally focus the discussion of our results of operations around major lines of business versus distinguishing between products and services 
product sales are predominantly generated in the electronic systems  aeronautics and space systems segments  while most of our services revenues are generated in our is gs segment 
for  net sales were billion  a increase over net sales for were billion  a increase over net sales increased during in the electronic systems and is gs segments but declined in aeronautics primarily due to fewer combat aircraft deliveries and at space systems due to both government and commercial satellite activities 
net sales increased during in all segments as compared to the us government is our largest customer  accounting for about of our net sales in   and other income expense  net was million for compared to million in this increase was primarily due to higher equity earnings in affiliates  the recognition of the deferred gain from the sale of our ownership interest in lockheed khrunichev energia international  inc lkei and earnings associated with reserves related to various land sales that were no longer required 
other income expense  net was million for compared to million in this decrease primarily was due to gains recognized in from the sale of shares of inmarsat and assets of space imaging  offset partially by increased equity earnings in affiliates in state income taxes are included in our operations as general and administrative costs and  under us government regulations  are allowable in establishing prices for the products and services we sell to the us government 
therefore  a substantial portion of state income taxes is included in our net sales and cost of sales 
as a result  the impact on our operating profit of certain transactions and other matters disclosed in this form k is disclosed net of state income taxes 
our operating profit for was billion  an increase of compared to our operating profit for was billion  an increase of compared to except for anticipated reductions at aeronautics  operating profit increased in all business segments in as compared to operating profit was favorably impacted by lower unallocated corporate costs and the increase in other income expense  net as discussed above 
in  operating profit increased across all business segments as compared to and was also favorably impacted by lower unallocated corporate costs 
unallocated corporate costs in both and were favorably impacted by declines in the fas cas pension adjustment  primarily due to the decline in fas expense 
interest expense for was million  or million lower than this decrease mainly was driven by the august redemption of our billion of floating rate convertible debentures  offset by interest expense on the 
table of contents million of new debt issued in the first quarter of interest expense for was million  or million lower than this decrease was mainly driven by lower interest expense associated with the september debt exchange 
other non operating income expense  net was an expense of million in compared to income of million in and income of million in the decrease in primarily was due to net unrealized losses on marketable securities held to fund certain non qualified employee benefit obligations and lower interest income on invested cash balances 
the increase in mainly was due to the million of debt exchange expenses recorded in  as there were no comparable charges in our effective income tax rates were for  for  and for the effective rates for all periods were lower than the statutory rate of due to tax deductions for us manufacturing activities  research and development r d tax credits  and dividends related to our employee stock ownership plan 
in addition  the rate for reflected a reduction in income tax expense of million recorded in the first quarter of arising from the closure of the irs examination of the and tax years 
the rate for reflected a reduction in income tax expense of million related to a refund claim for additional extraterritorial income eti exclusion benefits in prior years recognized in the third quarter of  and current year eti tax benefits 
the increase in the effective tax rate when compared to primarily is due to the million benefit recorded in the first quarter of the increase in the effective tax rate when compared to primarily is the result of the elimination of the extraterritorial tax benefits in  partially offset by additional tax benefits in resulting from a statutory increase in us manufacturing benefits  new legislation that provided enhanced r d tax credits and the favorable closure of an irs audit 
the emergency economic stabilization act of signed by the president on october  retroactively extends the r d tax credit for two years  from january  to december   and increases the alternative simplified r d credit rate from to for calendar year as a result  we recognized a tax benefit  which reduced our income tax expense in the fourth quarter of by million 
net earnings increased as compared to the prior year for the sixth consecutive year 
we reported net earnings of billion per share in  billion per share in  and billion per share in both net earnings and earnings per share were affected by the factors discussed above 
in addition  earnings per share has benefitted from the significant number of shares repurchased under our share repurchase program 
the effect of those repurchases has been partially offset by common stock issued under our stock based compensation and defined contribution plans 
discussion of business segments we operate in four principal business segments electronic systems  is gs  aeronautics and space systems 
we organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered 
our electronic systems business segment manages complex programs and designs  develops  and integrates hardware and software solutions to ensure the mission readiness of armed forces and government agencies worldwide 
with such a broad portfolio of products and services  many of its activities involve a combination of both development and production contracts with varying delivery schedules 
this business segment has continued to expand its core competencies as a leading systems integrator both domestically and internationally 
some of its more significant programs  including the terminal high altitude area defense thaad system  the vh presidential helicopter  the aegis weapon system and the arrowhead fire control system for the apache helicopter  demonstrate the diverse products and services electronic systems provides 
our is gs business segment combines a full range of information competencies with a global delivery capability 
the segment provides full life cycle support and expertise in the areas of software and systems engineering  including space  air  and ground systems 
it provides logistics  mission operations support  peacekeeping  and nation building services for a wide variety of us defense and civil government agencies 
is gs key programs and activities include the transformational communications milsatcom mission operations segment tmos program  the faa en route automation modernization eram program  the joint tactical radio system jtrs program  the decennial response integration system dris program  and a number of task order vehicles indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts in our information technology line of business 
we expect continued strong growth in providing information technology solutions to government agencies 
aeronautics is engaged in the research  design  development  manufacture  integration  sustainment  support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft  including combat and air mobility aircraft  unmanned air vehicles  and related 
table of contents technologies 
key combat aircraft programs include the f lightning ii  f raptor  and f fighting falcon fighter aircraft 
the f has completed the seventh year of development and has entered low rate initial production 
aeronautics has been producing f s since  and delivered to the us air force in  bringing the total deliveries to through a total of f s were delivered in worldwide  bringing the total deliveries to  through key air mobility programs include the c j super hercules and the c super galaxy 
we delivered c js in a total of c js have been ordered with delivered through in addition to aircraft production  aeronautics provides logistics support  sustainment  and upgrade modification services for its aircraft 
sales at aeronautics are expected to grow in primarily due to the projected increase in f production activities and c j deliveries 
our space systems business segment is engaged in the design  research and development  engineering  and production of satellites  strategic and defensive missile systems  and space transportation systems 
through ownership interests in two joint ventures  usa and ula  the segment also includes space shuttle processing activities and expendable launch services for the us government 
government satellite programs include the advanced extremely high frequency aehf system  the mobile user objective system muos  the global positioning system gps and the space based infrared system sbirs 
strategic and missile defense programs include the targets and countermeasures program and the fleet ballistic missile program 
space transportation includes the nasa orion program 
in the following table of financial data  total operating profit of the business segments is reconciled to the corresponding consolidated amount 
because the activities of the investees in which certain business segments hold equity interests are closely aligned with the operations of those segments  the equity earnings losses from those investees are included in the operating profit of the respective segments 
the reconciling item unallocated corporate income expense  net includes the fas cas pension adjustment see the discussion in discussion of business segments under unallocated corporate income expense  net  costs for stock based compensation programs  the effects of items not considered part of management s evaluation of segment operating performance  and corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments  as well as other miscellaneous corporate activities 
this table shows net sales and operating profit of the business segments and reconciles to the consolidated total 
in millions net sales electronic systems information systems global services aeronautics space systems total operating profit electronic systems information systems global services aeronautics space systems total business segments unallocated corporate income expense  net total the following segment discussions also include information relating to negotiated backlog for each segment 
total negotiated backlog was approximately billion  billion  and billion at december    and these amounts included both funded backlog unfilled firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer congress in the case of us government agencies and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated 
negotiated backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts 
funded backlog was approximately billion at december  the aeronautics segment generally includes fewer programs that have much larger sales and operating results than programs included in the other segments 
due to the large number of comparatively smaller programs in the remaining segments  the discussion of the results of operations of those business segments generally focuses on lines of business within the segment rather than on specific programs 
the following tables of financial information and related discussion of the results of operations of our business segments are consistent with the presentation of segment information in note to the 
table of contents financial statements 
we have a number of programs that are classified by the us government and cannot be specifically described 
the operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results  and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs 
in our discussion of comparative results  changes in net sales and operating profit are generally expressed in terms of volume and or performance 
volume refers to increases or decreases in sales resulting from varying production activity levels  deliveries or services levels on individual contracts 
volume changes typically include a corresponding change in operating profit based on the estimated profit rate at completion for a particular contract for design  development and production activities 
performance generally refers to changes in contract profit booking rates 
these changes on our contracts for products usually relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion of the contracts that reflect improved or deteriorated operating or award fee performance on a particular contract 
changes in contract profit booking rates on contracts for products are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception to date effect of the changes on current and prior periods 
recognition of the inception to date adjustment in the current or prior periods may affect the comparison of segment operating results

space systems space systems operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit backlog at year end net sales for space systems decreased in compared to sales declines in satellites partially were offset by growth in space transportation 
in satellites  sales declined million due to lower volume in both commercial and government satellite activities 
there were two commercial satellite deliveries during  compared to four in space transportation sales increased million primarily due to higher volume on the orion program 
net sales for space systems increased in compared to during the year  sales increases at satellites and strategic defensive missile systems s dms more than offset declines at space transportation 
in satellites  an increase of million was mainly driven by higher volume in government satellite activities  while commercial satellites sales remained relatively flat 
there were four commercial satellite deliveries during and five in higher volume in strategic missile programs accounted for the majority of a million increase in sales at s dms 
space transportation sales declined million 
this decline was expected given the divestiture of the international launch services business and the formation of ula in the fourth quarter of the corporation no longer records sales on atlas launch vehicles and related support to the us government  as ula is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
this sales decline was offset partially by higher volume on the orion program 

table of contents operating profit increased by in compared to the increase in operating profit was due to space transportation  which partially was offset by a decline in satellites 
in space transportation  the million increase mainly was attributable to higher equity earnings on the ula joint venture  volume on the orion program  and the results from successful negotiations of a terminated commercial launch service contract in the first quarter of the improvement in ula s earnings also reflects the absence in of a charge recognized in the third quarter of for asset impairment on the delta ii medium lift launch vehicles 
in satellites  operating profit declined by million during the year due to lower volume and performance on certain government satellite programs 
operating profit for the segment increased in compared to during the year  operating profit growth in satellites and s dms more than offset declines at space transportation 
satellites operating profit increased million due to improved performance in commercial and government satellite activities 
increased operating profit of million at s dms was due to higher volume and improved performance on strategic missile programs 
in space transportation  the decline of million in operating profit from was mainly due to a charge recognized by ula in the third quarter of for an asset impairment on delta ii medium lift launch vehicles 
the decline also reflects benefits recognized in from risk reduction activities  including the definitization of the elc contract  and other performance improvements on the atlas program  with no similar items recognized in the comparable period in the increase in backlog during as compared to was primarily due to increased orders on government satellite programs and on the orion program 
the decrease in backlog during as compared to was mainly due to sales volume related to government and commercial satellite programs  which more than offset increased orders on strategic missile programs 
unallocated corporate income expense  net the following table shows the components of unallocated corporate income expense  net 
in millions fas cas pension adjustment items not considered in segment operating performance stock compensation expense other  net the fas cas pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with fas and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with cas 
because the cas expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on us government contracts  and therefore recognized in a particular segment s net sales and cost of sales  the results of operations of our segments only include pension expense as determined and funded in accordance with cas rules 
accordingly  the fas cas adjustment is not included in segment operating results and therefore is included in the reconciliation of total segment operating profit to consolidated operating profit under gaap 
the following table shows the cas funding that is included as expense in the segments operating results  the related fas expense  and the resulting fas cas pension adjustment in millions fas expense less cas expense and funding fas cas pension adjustment income expense the fas expense decreased in compared to  and in compared to the decrease in both periods was due to an increase in the discount rate and other factors such as the effects of the actual return on plan assets at the respective plan measurement dates through december  see the related discussion in critical accounting policies under the caption postretirement benefit plans 
certain items are excluded from segment results as part of senior management s evaluation of segment operating performance consistent with the management approach permitted by fas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
for example  gains and losses related to the disposition of businesses or investments managed by corporate  as well as certain other corporate activities  are not considered by management in evaluating the operating 
table of contents performance of business segments

liquidity and cash flows current economic and market conditions have placed material constraints on the ability of many companies to access capital in the debt and equity markets 
over the past few years  we have generated strong cash flows  and generally have funded our operations  debt service and repayments  capital expenditures  share repurchases  dividends  acquisitions  retirement plan funding  and discretionary funding needs from our cash from operations 
we have accessed the capital markets on limited occasions  as needed including the issuance of million of debt securities in we also access the credit markets  as needed  to obtain letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes eg  guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts 
at this time  our access to liquidity and capital resources generally has not been materially affected by the current credit environment 
our cash from operations continues to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditure needs 
if market conditions continue to deteriorate  the cost or availability of future borrowings  if any  in the debt markets  the fees we pay under our credit facilities  or the cost or availability of providing letters of credit or other trade instruments to support our operating activities may be materially and adversely affected 
we have financing resources available see discussion under capital structure and resources to fund potential cash outflows that are less predictable or more discretionary 
although credit from financial institutions is constrained  there are attractive interest rates available for credit worthy corporate issuers via the public debt markets 
we believe that we have access to the credit markets  if needed for liquidity or general corporate purposes 
we have encountered some instances in which financial institutions participating in our standby credit facilities have less credit capacity or are seeking to reduce their credit exposures generally 
this may result in the need to identify additional financial institutions to participate in existing credit facilities 
in addition  it may be more difficult to structure financing for future long term project finance and joint venture activities  especially in international markets 
current market conditions raise increased concerns about counterparty risk 
we are exposed to counterparty credit risk  as we engage in derivative transactions with financial institutions to hedge foreign currency exposures 
in terms of supply chain management  our suppliers and subcontractors also may find it more difficult to access credit to support their operations 
to date  we have not been materially adversely affected by counterparty credit defaults or subcontractor and supplier credit support difficulties 

table of contents in  we repaid billion in long term debt  including the redemption of billion in principal amount of our convertible debentures 
over the past decade  we have reduced our long term debt by over billion  from billion at year end to billion at year end our currently scheduled debt maturities through total a relatively modest million 
cash received from customers  either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred  is our primary source of cash 
we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer 
billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors  including the contract type 
for example  contracts may be cost reimbursable  time and materials  or fixed price 
we generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts  which together represent approximately of the revenues we recorded in  as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed 
in contrast to cost reimbursable contracts  for fixed price contracts  we generally do not bill until milestones  including deliveries  are achieved 
a number of our contracts may provide for performance based payments which allow us to bill and collect cash prior to completing the work 
fixed price contracts represented approximately of the revenues we recorded in the majority of our capital expenditures for and those planned for can be divided into the categories of facilities infrastructure  equipment  and information technology it 
expenditures for facilities infrastructure and equipment are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments 
for example  we have projects underway in our aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support low rate production of the f combat aircraft 
in addition  we have several projects underway to modernize certain of our space systems facilities that are as much as years old 
we also incur capital expenditures for it to support programs and general enterprise it infrastructure 
we have a balanced cash deployment and disciplined growth strategy to enhance shareholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise 
consistent with that strategy  we have invested in our business eg  capital expenditures  independent research and development  made selective acquisitions of businesses  repurchased shares  increased our dividends  and opportunistically reduced and refinanced our debt 
the following provides an overview of our execution of this strategy 
net cash provided by operating activities in millions logo operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to billion in as compared to the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net earnings of million  lower postretirement benefit plan contributions of million  and a million dividend received from ula 
this increase was offset partially by a million decrease in cash provided by working capital and higher net tax payments of million compared to the decline in operating working capital was primarily due to an increase in inventories on combat aircraft programs at aeronautics and a decrease in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred on various programs in the missiles fire control line of business at electronic systems 
operating working capital accounts consist of receivables  inventories  accounts payable  and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred

investing activities capital expenditures capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment amounted to million in  million in  and million in we expect our capital expenditures over the next three years to exceed expenditures consistent with the expected growth in our business and to support specific program requirements 
acquisitions  divestitures and other activities we have a process to selectively identify businesses for acquisition that meet our strategic  operational and financial targets  help build a balanced portfolio and provide disciplined growth 
as disclosed under the caption acquisition and divestiture activities  we paid million in for acquisition activities  including the acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates  compared with million in and  million in in  we received proceeds of million from the sale of our remaining interest in comsat international 
during  we received proceeds of million from the sale of our remaining shares in inmarsat  million from the sale of assets of space imaging  llc  and million from the sale of lockheed martin intersputnik 
financing activities share issuances  repurchases and dividends cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with stock option exercises during the years ended december    and totaled million  million  and million 
those activities resulted in the issuance of million shares  million shares  and million shares during the respective periods 
during  and  we used cash of  million   million  and  million for common share repurchase activity see note 
our share repurchase program authorizes the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock from time to time at management s discretion  including million of additional shares our board authorized for repurchase in as of december   we had repurchased a total of million shares under the program  and there remained approximately million shares that may be repurchased in the future 
the payment of dividends on our common shares is one of the key components of our balanced cash deployment strategy 
shareholders were paid cash dividends of million in  million in  and million in we have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last three years 
we declared quarterly dividends in of per share during each of the first three quarters and per share for the last quarter  in of per share during each of the first three quarters and per share for the last quarter  and in of per share during each of the first three quarters and per share for the last quarter 
issuance and repayment of long term debt in we issued million of long term notes due in the notes have a fixed coupon interest rate of 
cash provided from operations has been our principal source of funds to reduce our long term debt 
in  we paid a total of billion representing the principal amount of our floating rate convertible debentures that were delivered for conversion or otherwise redeemed  and issued million shares of our common stock to satisfy conversion obligations of million in excess of the principal amount see note 
we also paid another million during related to other repayments of long term debt based on scheduled maturities  compared to million in debt repayments in during  we paid million to complete an exchange of debt and million related to scheduled debt repayments 
capital structure and resources at december   we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately billion and short term investments of million 
our long term debt  net of unamortized discounts  amounted to billion 
as of the end of  our long term debt bears interest at fixed rates and mainly is in the form of publicly issued notes and debentures 
in  we issued million of notes due in in august  all of our billion of floating rate convertible debentures were delivered for conversion or otherwise redeemed consistent with our announcement of their planned redemption  and we issued million shares of our common stock to satisfy conversion obligations of million in excess of the principal amount see note 
in august  we issued billion of notes due the notes 
the notes were issued in exchange for certain other of our then outstanding debt securities  and cash consideration of million 
the cash consideration of million is included in the statement of cash flows in financing activities  and the notes are included on our balance sheet 
table of contents net of the unamortized discount under the caption long term debt  net 
the expenses associated with the exchange  net of state income tax benefits  totaled million and were recorded in other non operating income expense  net 
they reduced net earnings in by million per share 
our stockholders equity amounted to billion at december   a decrease of billion from december  the decrease primarily was due to the annual remeasurement of the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans at december under fas see note  which increased the accumulated other comprehensive loss by billion  the repurchase of million common shares for billion  and payment of million of dividends during the year 
these decreases partially were offset by net earnings of billion and employee stock activity of million 
as we repurchase our common shares  we reduce common stock for the of par value of the shares repurchased  with the remainder of the purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital 
due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program  additional paid in capital was reduced to zero  with the remainder of the excess of purchase price over par value of billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings 
through our debt repayment activities  our long term debt balance has declined billion over the last five years from billion at december  our debt to total capital ratio was at december   up from at december  the increase from to primarily was attributable to the decrease in stockholders equity associated with postretirement benefit plans discussed above 
debt to total capital ratio logo return on invested capital roic improved by basis points during to 
we define roic as net earnings plus after tax interest expense divided by average invested capital stockholders equity plus debt  after adjusting stockholders equity by adding back amounts related to postretirement benefit plans 
we believe that reporting roic provides investors with greater visibility into how effectively we use the capital invested in our operations 
we use roic as one of the inputs in our evaluation of multi year investment decisions and as a long term performance measure 
we also use roic as a factor in evaluating management performance under certain of our incentive compensation plans 
roic is not a measure of financial performance under us generally accepted accounting principles  and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 
roic should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of performance 
see consolidated financial data five year summary on page of this form k for additional information concerning how we calculate roic 
return on invested capital ratio logo 
table of contents at december   we had in place a billion revolving credit facility with a group of banks which expires in june there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at december  borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based  at our option  on the eurodollar rate or a bank defined base rate 
each bank s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to  among other things  our compliance with various representations  warranties and covenants  including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets  and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio 
the leverage ratio covenant excludes the adjustments recognized in stockholders equity related to our postretirement benefit plans 
we have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper 
there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at december  if we were to issue commercial paper  the borrowings would be supported by the billion credit facility 
we have an effective shelf registration statement on form s on file with the securities and exchange commission to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities 
if we were to issue debt under this shelf registration  we would expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes 
these purposes may include repayment of debt  working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions and any other general corporate purpose 
we actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable 
we review changes in financial  market and economic conditions to manage the types  amounts and maturities of our indebtedness 
we may at times refinance existing indebtedness  vary our mix of variable rate and fixed rate debt  or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs 
contractual commitments and off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had contractual commitments to repay debt  make payments under operating leases  settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services  and settle tax and other liabilities 
capital lease obligations were negligible 
payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows payments due by period in millions total less than year years years after years long term debt a interest payments other liabilities operating lease obligations purchase obligations operating activities capital expenditures total contractual cash obligations a the total amount of long term debt excludes the unamortized discount of million see note 
generally  our long term debt obligations are subject to  along with other things  compliance with certain covenants  including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets 
interest payments include interest related to the outstanding debt through maturity 
amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long term liabilities recorded as of december  such amounts mainly include expected payments under deferred compensation plans  non qualified pension plans  environmental liabilities and business acquisition agreements 
obligations related to environmental liabilities represent our estimate of obligations for sites at which we are performing remediation activities  excluding amounts reimbursed by the us government in its capacity as a potentially responsible party 
the amounts also include liabilities related to tax positions we have taken for which we have recorded liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes see notes and 
we estimated the timing of payments based on the expected completion of the related examinations by the applicable taxing authorities 

table of contents purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and requirements contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages 
such agreements and contracts may  for example  be related to direct materials  obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements 
total purchase obligations in the preceding table include approximately billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our us government customers 
however  the us government would generally be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts for convenience pursuant to the far 
for example  if we had commitments to purchase goods and services that were entered into as a result of a specific contract we received from our us government customer and the customer terminated the contract for its convenience  any amounts we would be required to pay to settle the related commitments  as well as amounts previously incurred  would generally be reimbursed by the customer 
this would also be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a us government contract 
the termination for convenience language may also be included in contracts with foreign  state and local governments 
we also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions  including contracts with commercial customers 
purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include amounts for facilities and equipment related to customer contracts 
we also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements  sometimes referred to as offset agreements  as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries 
these agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country 
offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash  including transferring technology  providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in country projects  and the purchase by third parties eg  our vendors of supplies from in country vendors 
these agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in country vendors  providing financial support for in country projects  and building or leasing facilities for in country operations 
we do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive 
offset programs generally extend over several years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements 
we have historically not been required to pay any such penalties 
the amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and generally require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement 
at december   we had outstanding offset agreements totaling billion  primarily related to our aeronautics segment  some of which extend through to the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at december  that also satisfy offset agreements  those amounts are included in the preceding table 
in connection with the formation of ula  we and the boeing company boeing each committed to provide up to million in additional capital contributions and million in other financial support to ula  as required 
the non capital financial support was required to be made in the form of a revolving credit facility between us and ula or guarantees of ula financing with third parties  in either case  to the extent necessary for ula to meet its working capital needs 
we agreed to provide this support for at least five years from december   the closing date of the transaction  and would expect to fund our requirements with cash on hand 
to satisfy our non capital financial support commitment  we and boeing have put into place a revolving credit agreement with ula  under which no amounts have been drawn 
at december   we and boeing had made million in payments under our capital contribution commitments  and we expect to contribute the remaining commitment of million each to ula in the first half of prior to those contributions  we expect to receive a dividend from ula in a like amount 
in addition  both we and boeing have cross indemnified each other related to certain financial support arrangements eg  letters of credit  surety bonds or foreign exchange contracts provided by either party and guarantees by us and boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ula under certain of its launch service contracts 
we believe ula will be able to fully perform its obligations  as it has done through december   and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the cross indemnities 
in  we and boeing received from ula a dividend of million each 
prior to distribution of the dividend  we  boeing and ula entered into an agreement whereby  if ula does not have sufficient cash resources and or credit capacity to make payments under the inventory supply agreement it has with boeing  both we and boeing would provide to ula  in the form of an additional capital contribution  amounts required for ula to make such payments 
such capital contributions would not exceed the aggregate amount of dividends we received in and any others we may receive through june  we currently believe that ula will have sufficient operating cash flows and credit capacity to meet its obligations such that we would not be required to make a contribution under this agreement 

table of contents we have entered into standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers mainly relating to advances received from customers and or the guarantee of future performance on some of our contracts 
in some cases  we may also guarantee the contractual performance of third parties 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit  surety bonds and guarantees  as follows commitment expiration by period in millions total commitment less than year a years a years a after years a standby letters of credit surety bonds guarantees total commitments a approximately  million  million  million  and million of standby letters of credit in the less than year  years  years  and after years periods  and approximately million and million of surety bonds in the less than year and years periods  are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation 
included in the table above is approximately million representing letter of credit amounts for which related obligations or liabilities are also recorded on the balance sheet  either as reductions of inventories  as customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred  or as other liabilities 
approximately billion of the standby letters of credit in the table above were issued to secure advance payments received under an f contract from an international customer 
these letters of credit are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance  and the amount available will be reduced as certain events occur throughout the period of performance in accordance with the contract terms 
similar to the letters of credit for the f contract  other letters of credit and surety bonds are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance 
under the agreement to sell lkei and ils see note  we were responsible for refunding customer advances to certain customers if launch services were not provided and ils did not refund the advances 
our responsibility to refund the advances expired upon the successful completion of the final launch  which occurred in november acquisition and divestiture activities we continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers 
we accomplish this not only internally  through our independent research and development activities  but also through acquisitions 
we selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments that complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies 
we have made a number of such niche acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates during the past several years 
conversely  we may also explore the divestiture of businesses  investments and real estate 
if we were to decide to sell any such assets  the resulting gains  if any  would be recorded when the transactions are completed and losses  if any  would be recorded when the value of the related asset is determined to be impaired 
acquisitions we used approximately million in for acquisition activities  including the acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates 
those activities included the acquisition of  among others  eagle group international  llc  which provides logistics  information technology  training and healthcare services to the us department of defense 
we used approximately million in for acquisition activities  including an additional contribution of million related to our investment in ula discussed below 
those activities also included the acquisition of  among others  management systems designers  inc  a provider of information technology it and scientific solutions supporting government life science  national security  and other civil agency missions 
we used approximately billion in for acquisition activities including the acquisition of  among others  pacific architects and engineers  inc  a provider of services to support military readiness  peacekeeping missions  nation building activities  and disaster relief services 
in each year  the amounts used for acquisitions included certain payments related to businesses acquired in prior years 
we accounted for the acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting  and therefore recorded purchase accounting adjustments by allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the acquisitions were not material to our consolidated results of operations in  or 
table of contents divestitures there were no divestiture activities in during and  we continued to execute the strategy to monetize certain of our equity investments and real estate by divesting of the following year ended december  our remaining interest in comsat international  which resulted in a gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income expense  net  and increased net earnings by million per share  and certain land in california  which resulted in a gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income expense  net  and increased net earnings by million per share 
year ended december  our ownership interests in lockheed khrunichev energia international  inc lkei and international launch services  inc 
ils 
the gain on the sale was deferred pending the disposition of guarantees associated with providing launch services for certain customers see note  million shares of inmarsat plc  which resulted in a gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income expense  net  and increased net earnings by million per share  the assets of space imaging  llc  which resulted in a gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income expense  net  and increased net earnings by million per share  and certain land in california and florida  which resulted in an aggregate gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income expense  net  and increased net earnings by million per share 
on december   we completed the formation of ula with boeing see note 
as part of ula s formation  we contributed certain assets and liabilities related to our atlas launch vehicle business 
our contribution  after completing working capital and conforming accounting adjustments and making an additional contribution of million in  totaled million 
we accounted for the transfer at net book value  with no gain or loss recognized 
our ownership share of ula s net assets exceeded the book value of our investment by approximately million  which we are recognizing ratably over years as equity in net earnings losses of equity investees in other income expense  net 
our investment in ula totaled million and million at december  and quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk we maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of domestic and international financial institutions 
we believe that they provide us with access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct business 
we continue to closely monitor the market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the impact from any single credit provider while ensuring availability of  and access to  sufficient credit resources 
our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities 
our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed rate long term debt 
our long term debt portfolio bears interest at fixed rates 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt instruments was approximately billion  compared with a carrying value of billion 
we use foreign currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and generally do so in ways that qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
these foreign currency exchange contracts hedge the fluctuations in cash flows associated with firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions contracted in foreign currencies 
related gains and losses on these contracts  to the extent they are effective hedges  are recognized in income at the same time the hedged transaction is recognized 
to the extent the hedges are ineffective  gains and losses on the contracts are recognized in the current period 
at december   the net fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding was an asset of million see note 
we evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have minimal credit risk at the time the agreements are executed 
our foreign exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several credit line banks 
we carefully monitor the amount of exposure we have with any given bank 
we periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we maintain a rabbi trust which includes investments to fund certain of our non qualified deferred compensation plans 
as of december   investments in the rabbi trust totaled million and are reflected at fair value on our balance sheet in other assets 
the rabbi trust holds investments in marketable equity securities that are exposed to price 
table of contents changes and investments in fixed income securities that are exposed to changes in interest rates 
changes in the value of the rabbi trust are recognized in our earnings  in the caption other non operating income expense  net 
during  we recorded net unrealized losses totaling million related to the decrease in the value of the rabbi trust assets 
a portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the rabbi trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices 
changes in the value of the deferred compensation liabilities are recognized in the caption unallocated corporate costs 
the current portion of the deferred compensation plan liabilities is on our balance sheet in salaries  benefits  and payroll taxes  and the non current portion of the liability is on our balance sheet in other liabilities 
the resulting change in the value of the liabilities generally has the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the rabbi trust 
during  we recorded earnings of million related to the decrease in the value of the deferred compensation liabilities 
recent accounting pronouncements there are a number of new accounting pronouncements and interpretations that will impact our financial statements and disclosures see note under the caption recent accounting pronouncements 
we do not expect that any of those pronouncements or interpretations upon adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures  including internal control over financial reporting  which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic filings with the sec is reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms  and to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly executed and recorded 
our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management  including our chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo  as appropriate  to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
in designing and evaluating such controls and procedures  we recognize that any controls and procedures  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives  and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 
also  we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities 
as we do not control or manage these entities  our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are necessarily substantially more limited in some cases  only that of a passive equity holder than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries 
we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency  while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment 
changes may include such activities as implementing new  more efficient systems  consolidating the activities of two or more business units  and migrating certain processes to our shared services centers 
in addition  when we acquire new businesses  we review the controls and procedures of the acquired business as part of our integration activities 
we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures  including internal control over financial reporting  as of december  the evaluation was performed with the participation of senior management of each business segment and key corporate functions  and under the supervision of the ceo and cfo 
based on this evaluation  the ceo and cfo concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december  our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
during  our management performed a separate evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  including performing self assessment and monitoring procedures 
based on those activities and other evaluation procedures  our management  including the ceo and cfo  concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december  management s report on our financial statements and internal control over financial reporting appears on page in addition  the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was audited by our independent registered public accounting firm 
their report appears on page there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected  or are reasonably likely to materially affect  our internal control over financial reporting
