item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements for the periods indicated  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  product warranties  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors including general market conditions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
results for the periods reported herein are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected in future periods

the company is one of several defendants in a patent infringement suit commenced by lectrolarm custom systems  inc in may in the united states district court for the western district of tennessee 
the alleged infringement by the company relates to its camera dome systems and other products that represent significant sales to the company 
among other things  the suit seeks past and enhanced damages  injunctive relief and attorney s fees 
in january  the company received the plaintiff s claim for past damages through december  that approximated million plus pre judgment interest 
the company and its outside patent counsel believe that the complaint against the company is without merit 
the company is vigorously defending itself and is a party to a joint defense with certain other named defendants 
in january  the company petitioned the us patent and trademark office uspto to reexamine the plaintiff s patent  believing it to be invalid 
in april  the uspto issued a non final office action rejecting all of the plaintiff s patent claims asserted against the company citing the existence of prior art of the company and another defendant 
on june   the federal district court granted the defendants motion for continuance delay of the trial  pending the outcome of the uspto s reexamination proceedings 
in february  the uspto issued a final rejection of the six claims in the plaintiff s patent asserted against the company  which was reaffirmed in june after the plaintiff filed a response with the uspto requesting reconsideration of its final rejection 
the plaintiff has appealed the examiner s decision to the uspto board of patent appeals and interferences and has an additional appeal available to it thereafter in the court of appeals for the federal circuit 
the company is unable to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss  if any  at this time 
although the company has received favorable rulings from the uspto with respect to the reexamination proceedings  there is always the possibility that the plaintiff s patent claims could be upheld in appeal and the matter would proceed to trial 
should this occur and the company receives an unfavorable outcome at trial  it could result in a liability that is material to the company s results of operations and financial position 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
as it relates to product sales  revenue is generally recognized when products are sold and title is passed to the customer 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
advance service billings under a national supply contract with one customer are deferred and recognized as revenues on a pro rata basis over the term of the service agreement 
pursuant to the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  the company evaluates multiple element revenue arrangements for separate units of accounting  and follows appropriate revenue recognition policies for each separate unit 
elements are considered separate units of accounting provided that i the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer  ii there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and iii if a general right of return exists relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially within the control of the company 
as applied to the company  under arrangements involving the sale of product and the provision of services  product sales are recognized as revenue when the products are sold and title is passed to the customer  and service revenue is recognized as services are performed 
for products that include more than incidental software  and for separate licenses of the company s software products  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of asc statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while the company engages in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from its estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence and slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the carrying cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
technology changes and market conditions may render some of the company s products obsolete and additional inventory write downs may be required 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of its long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of such assets based upon the expectations of undiscounted cash flows from such assets 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss would be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount 
the company s ability to recover the reported amounts of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient taxable income during the periods over which net temporary tax differences become deductible 
the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to labor  product and other matters 
the company assesses the likelihood of an adverse judgment or outcomes for these matters  as well as the range of potential losses 
a determination of the reserves required  if any  is made after careful analysis 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments
