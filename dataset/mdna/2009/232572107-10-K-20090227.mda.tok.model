item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
overview we provide state of the art lithographic light sources designed to help enable the performance of leading edge wafer steppers and scanners built by the three lithography tool manufacturers  and we provide installed base products to support chipmakers that use these light sources in the production of advanced wafer patterning applications 
we currently supply duv light sources to each of the lithography tool manufacturers  asml  canon  and nikon  who in turn supply their wafer steppers and scanners to chipmakers 
in addition  we sell installed base products  which include replacement parts  various service and support offerings and upgrades to lithography tool manufacturers as well as directly to chipmakers 
we provide worldwide service and support through certified field service engineers  and we have replacement parts depots located close to many of our customers throughout the world 
our light source systems currently constitute many of the excimer light sources incorporated in lithography wafer stepper and scanner tools at chipmakers worldwide 
as the leading supplier of lithography light sources  many of the consumer electronic devices manufactured in the last several years contain a semiconductor manufactured using our light sources 
we currently operate within two reportable segments  cymer and tcz 
the cymer segment of our business consists of products including photolithography light sources and installed base products 
the tcz segment is targeting the growing market for ltps processing used in the manufacture of oled flat panel displays 
no sales or revenues have been earned or recorded to date for our tcz segment 
additional information regarding our reporting segment is contained in note  segment and geographic information to our consolidated financial statements and in this item under results of operations for the years ended december   and since we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from lithography tool manufacturers and chipmakers  we are subject to the volatile and unpredictable cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry 
the semiconductor equipment industry historically has experienced periodic ups and downs  some of them more pronounced than others 
the most recent growth year for the semiconductor equipment industry was  during which we achieved record revenue and net income levels 
although we and many of the companies in our industry initially expected to be another growth year  activity levels decreased as the year progressed and the semiconductor industry entered a slowdown 
in  particularly in the second half of  global economic conditions deteriorated which negatively effected consumer spending on electronics and the downturn in the semiconductor industry worsened significantly 
as a result  chipmakers dramatically reduced their capital spending and delayed or cancelled deliveries of equipment originally scheduled to occur in or our light source system shipments have historically tracked with the semiconductor equipment cycle while our installed base products and the associated revenue have scaled with utilization of our light sources in the field and the growth of our installed base of light source systems 
as a result  our light source systems unit shipments declined by and the associated revenue by in as compared to although chipmakers began to reduce their manufacturing utilization levels in the second half of in an effort to align their chip inventories with rapidly declining electronics demand  our installed base products revenue still grew by approximately in as compared to the prior year 
the growth of installed base products in was driven by increasing pulse utilization in the first half of the year and the overall increase in our installed base of light sources in as compared to installed base product revenue totaled million in overall  our total revenue declined by approximately in as compared to 
table of contents in we shipped light source systems with arf accounting for of the total shipments 
our xlr series accounted for of the arf light source systems we shipped  with the xlr i being selected by chipmakers in the memory  foundry and logic sectors 
in  we introduced  and received multiple orders for  the newest light source in the xlr series  the xlr d  designed for dry arf applications with a cd of nm 
we believe that we are also well positioned to support double patterning at nm with the xlr i  the industry s first w arf light source designed for use in immersion double patterning applications 
we received additional orders for multiple xlr i systems in the second half of  and multiple units of the xlrd and xlri shipped in with product demand heavily weighted toward these high productivity arf light sources  our currency adjusted average selling price asp continued to rise  reaching million during as a result of this higher asp in  our light source system revenue did not decline at as high a rate as did the light source system unit shipments from to during we made significant strides helping customers increase uptime and wafer output  while reducing their cost of operations with longer life modules and enhancements like gas lifetime extension glx 
we also continued to demonstrate the value of our onpulse product 
onpulse agreements now cover installations at leading chipmakers in asia  north america and europe  all of which have implemented the product to improve wafer production  reduce total operating costs  enhance laser cost predictability  and simplify administration 
in  we continued to make progress on our laser produced plasma euv source development 
during the year we achieved new milestones in energy levels and duration and we demonstrated further improvement in our debris mitigation technology 
as part of our multi year  multi unit agreement with asml  we expect to ship several commercial systems in additionally  we are making progress in tcz  our joint venture with zeiss that is developing a production tool for the flat panel display industry 
tcz is currently building multiple production tools  and anticipates delivering its first prototype tool in provided that it receives a purchase order for the tool from its prospective customer 
the global semiconductor industry and the economy as a whole have entered one of the most difficult periods in recent history 
lower consumer spending  tighter credit markets  and rising unemployment are reducing consumer demand for electronics  resulting in an overall slowdown in semiconductor capital spending  including lithography 
visibility into customers investment plans has been reduced and the timing for capacity orders is uncertain 
demand for new light source systems has declined sharply and demand for installed base products is slowing due to lower utilization of our light source systems by our customers 
we expect that the total available light source market will be considerably lower in  and that demand will be dominated by the logic sector 
our expectation for the year is for advanced arf immersion orders to represent the majority of scanner and light source demand 
we are focused on winning each light source selection by providing customers with increased performance  productivity and lower cost of operations 
we will continue to strengthen our leadership position by investing responsibly in research and development  delivering new xlr features and capabilities and successfully commercializing our euv source product 
we are also focused on increasing efficiencies within manufacturing and the field  driving continuous improvement in quality and reliability  and we will continue to maintain tight cost control 
business and economic highlights was a very volatile economic year 
the rate of deterioration in the semiconductor capital equipment industry was unprecedented 
in january  gartner dataquest forecasted that worldwide semiconductor capital equipment spending would decrease from levels and that worldwide semiconductor capital equipment spending is on pace to decline from levels 
in response to these rapidly changing business conditions  we took several actions to reduce our 
table of contents cost structure  including executing a reduction in our workforce and reducing operating expenses 
during a year of declining demand  we were able to considerably strengthen our duv product portfolio and overall product reliability  and quality continued to increase 
our installed base products business grew and we believe we are in a leadership position with advanced arf immersion  next generation laser produced plasma euv light source technology and tcz flat panel display technologies 
as a result of the downturn in the global economy and the semiconductor industry and the crisis in the financial markets in  there were negative impacts to our financial results in beyond those described above related to our revenues 
they include the following which we recorded in our consolidated financial statements during the year ended december  a million impairment of an auction rate security with a face value of million in our investment portfolio that we purchased in october based on the type and magnitude of this impairment  we were required to record this as an other than temporary loss in our consolidated statement of income in foreign currency losses which totaled million and were associated with the significant fluctuations of the foreign exchange rates in the countries in which our subsidiaries are located and do business  particularly the korean won  the japanese yen and the euro 
this foreign currency exposure is caused by the fact that our foreign subsidiaries purchase inventory from our corporate office in us dollars  but they operate in functional currencies other than us dollars 
bad debt expense of million as a result of certain of our customers experiencing financial difficulties associated with the downturn in the semiconductor industry and global economy 
write downs of the value of our inventory of million in response to the decreasing demand for our products and increased risk of parts on hand in excess of our demand plan 
as a result of the above items and the overall decline in our financial performance and net income in  we took the following actions in late  in november  we conducted an approximate reduction in our global workforce which resulted in charges of approximately million which we recorded in our consolidated financial statements during the three months ended december  this reduction in workforce affected all areas of the company and we anticipate that this action will result in an annual savings of approximately million 
we opened several bonded warehouses abroad in the third and fourth quarters of in an effort to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure associated with the inventory sales between our us corporate office and our foreign subsidiaries 
with this change  some of the inventory previously purchased from our foreign subsidiaries is now located in bonded warehouses and are owned by our us parent company and  accordingly  valued in us dollars 
outlook we anticipate that will be a very challenging business environment 
we expect lithography light source demand and chipmaker factory utilization to be at extremely low levels 
our top priorities are to continue to increase xl platform productivity and reliability  further develop our installed base products business  build upon our euv program success  and continue to improve the planning and process execution of the company 
we will also continue to size the company and its cost structure to address changes in the global business conditions 
in january  we announced that we were taking actions to further lower our global cost structure from those already taken by us in november these actions included an additional reduction in our global workforce that resulted in charges of approximately million which we will record in the first quarter of in connection with this reduction in workforce  we reduced the 
table of contents annual salaries of certain of our executive officers effective in january  reduced all other employees salaries by and took other actions to significantly reduce other operating expenses  as a result of these actions  we expect to lower our global cost structure by approximately to million annually starting in critical accounting policies and estimates general the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and use judgment that may impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
as a part of our ongoing internal processes  we regularly evaluate our estimates and judgments associated with revenue recognition  inventory valuation  refurbished inventories  warranty obligations  stock based compensation  income taxes  allowances for doubtful accounts  long lived assets valuation  goodwill valuation  financial assets and liabilities valuation and contingencies and litigation 
we base these estimates and judgments upon historical information and other facts and assumptions that we believe to be valid and or reasonable under the circumstances 
these assumptions and facts form the basis for making judgments and estimates and for determining the carrying values of our assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
adverse global economic conditions  illiquid credit markets  volatile equity  foreign currency and energy markets and declines in consumer spending have combined to increase uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  particularly those related to the condition of the economy  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe that revenue recognition  inventory valuation  refurbished inventories  warranty obligations  stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts  long lived assets valuation  and income taxes require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements than do other of our accounting estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition our revenues consist of product sales  which primarily include sales of light source systems and installed base products which consist of replacement parts and  to a lesser extent  training  service  upgrades  and refurbishments of our light source systems 
the sales of our light source systems generally include training and installation services 
we determined that these elements qualify as one unit of accounting under emerging issues task force bulletin no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf  as we do not have evidence of fair value for the undelivered training and installation elements 
furthermore  we determined that the undelivered training and installation elements are perfunctory performance obligations and are not essential to the functionality of our light source systems 
for the installation element  we determined it to be a perfunctory performance obligation due to the following installation of our light source systems is provided primarily as a courtesy to our customers and not as a requirement of the light source system sale  our customers have the capability to perform the installation of the light source systems themselves  we have adequate history performing such light source system installations that we can accurately estimate the installation costs and our cost to perform a light source system installation is less than of the sales price of the light source system and the installation takes a minimal number of hours to perform 
in addition  the training services are considered to be perfunctory as they are only provided as a courtesy to our customers and are not a requirement of the light source system sales 
therefore  in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 we recognize revenue when the revenue recognition criteria are met for 
table of contents the light source system  and accrue the costs of providing the training and installation services 
we recognize light source system revenue at one of following three points  depending on the terms of our arrangement with our customer shipment of the light source system  delivery of the light source system or receipt of an acceptance certificate 
for the majority of our light source system sales  the shipping terms are fob shipping point and revenue is recognized upon shipment 
for our arrangements which include fob destination shipping terms  revenue is recognized upon delivery of the light source system to our customer 
lastly  one of our light source system arrangements includes an acceptance provision  which is satisfied by the issuance of an acceptance certificate by the customer 
for these transactions  we recognize revenue upon receipt of the acceptance certificate 
in addition  we test our light source systems in environments similar to those used by our customers prior to shipment to ensure that they meet published specifications 
on a very limited basis  certain of our product sales include additional elements  such as future product upgrades 
for these transactions  we allocate consideration to the multiple elements based on the relative fair values of each separate element which we determine based on prices charged for such items when sold on a stand alone basis 
in cases where there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s in an arrangement but no such evidence for the delivered item s  we use the residual method to allocate the arrangement s consideration 
if there is no objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  we account for the transaction as a single unit of accounting per the requirements of eitf our sales arrangements do not include general rights of return 
revenue from replacement parts is recognized at the point that legal title passes to the customer  which is generally upon shipment from our facility 
for a significant portion of our replacement parts sales  our customers return the consumed assembly to us as part of the sale of the new part 
we reuse some of the material within these core assemblies  mainly metal components  for the future build of core assemblies 
as a result  our revenue consists of both cash and the value of the reusable parts received from our customers as consideration for these spare replacement part sales 
revenue associated with our customers return of core assemblies is recognized upon receipt of the returned core assembly 
the amount of the revenue is determined based upon the fair value of the reusable parts that we expect to yield from the returned core assembly which is based on historical experience 
service and training revenue is recognized as the services are rendered 
revenue associated with our onpulse contracts  which include primarily replacement parts and to a much lesser extent services  is recognized based on the pulse usage of the light source systems covered under the contract 
revenue is determined based on a per pulse fee and the number of pulses utilized during each month  with no minimums or maximums 
from a revenue classification and reporting standpoint  we are able to determine the relative fair values of the replacement part and service components of the revenues recognized under such contracts 
to date  the revenue associated with the service element of our onpulse contracts when combined with our training  service and service contract revenue has been less than of our total revenue 
on a very limited basis  we sell upgrades for our light source systems or refurbish light source systems owned by our customers to their original or new condition 
revenue from the sale of upgrades is recognized when the upgrade has been successfully installed by us and accepted by the customer 
revenue from refurbished light source systems is recognized when the refurbishment process has been completed and  depending upon the customer  the proper delivery or acceptance terms have been met 
deferred revenue represents payments received from our customers in advance of the delivery of products and or services  or before the satisfaction of all revenue recognition requirements as described above 

table of contents inventory valuation our inventories are recorded at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or estimated market value  which is defined as the lower of the current replacement cost or net realizable value as defined by accounting research bulletin no 
 restatement and revision of accounting research bulletins  if the market value is less than cost 
we evaluate the need to record adjustments for impairment of our inventory on a quarterly basis and our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods  replacement parts and reusable parts that we use for our refurbishment activities 
obsolete inventory or inventory for which we either do not have expected usage based on our forecasted demand for the next months or do not expect to have a high likelihood of use beyond months is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
when we perform our quarterly analysis of obsolete and excess inventory  we take into consideration certain assumptions related to market conditions and future demands for our products  including changes to product mix  new product introductions  and or product discontinuances  which may result in excess or obsolete inventory 
as part of this analysis  we also determine whether there are potential amounts owed to vendors as a result of cancelled or modified raw material orders 
we estimate and record a separate liability  which is included in accrued and other liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets for such amounts owed 
the methodologies used to analyze excess and obsolete inventory and determine the value of our inventory are significantly affected by future demand and usage of our products 
there are many factors that could potentially affect the future demand or usage of our products  including the following condition of the semiconductor industry  which is cyclical in nature  overall condition of the world economy which can positively or negatively impact the demand for our products  rate at which our lithography tool manufacturers and chipmaker customers take delivery of our light source systems and our replacement parts  loss of any of our major customers or a significant change in demand from any of these customers  overall mix of light source system models or replacement parts and any changes to that mix required by our customers  utilization rates of our light sources at chipmakers  and engineering change orders 
based upon our experience  we believe that the estimates we use to calculate the value of our inventories are reasonable and properly reflect the risk of excess and obsolete inventory 
if actual demand or the usage periods for our inventory are substantially different from our estimates  such differences may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
during adverse economic conditions  such as those that existed in the second half of and are expected to continue into  it is difficult to estimate the future demand for our products 
as a result  the likelihood that the usage period for our inventory will substantially differ from our estimates is increased 
in order to minimize this risk  we used the most current demand plan information available to us so that the calculations for our excess inventory reflect the current state of the economy and our business  which have both deteriorated from prior periods 
refurbished inventories as part of our regular business activities  we conduct significant parts refurbishment and material reclaim activities related to some of our core assemblies  particularly our chamber assemblies 
these 
table of contents activities involve arrangements with our customers where we sell a new part to the customer at a reduced sales price if the customer returns the consumed core assembly that the new part replaces 
these returned core assemblies contain a certain amount of material  primarily metal components  that may be reused by us in the manufacture of future core assemblies 
upon receipt of these consumed core assemblies from our customers  we record an entry to recognize the estimated fair value of the reusable components either as revenue if the return of the core assembly relates to a spare part replacement sale or as a reduction in cost of revenue if the return of the core assembly is related to a part being replaced under our warranty provisions or under a service or support contract with our customer 
the value of the reusable parts contained within the consumed assembly is determined based upon historical data on the value of the reusable parts that we typically yield from a consumed core assembly 
as part of our normal excess and obsolete inventory analysis  these consumed core assemblies are also reviewed on a monthly basis and an adjustment to inventory is recorded as appropriate for these parts 
warranty obligations we maintain an accrual for the estimated cost of product warranties associated with our product sales 
warranty costs include replacement parts and labor costs to repair our products during the warranty periods 
at the time revenue is recognized  we record a warranty provision  which is included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of income 
the warranty coverage period and terms for light source systems and replacement parts varies by light source system model 
the warranty provision for our products is reviewed monthly and determined by using a statistical financial model  which takes into consideration actual historical expenses  product failure rates  and potential risks associated with our different products 
this model is then used to estimate future expenses related to warranty and the required warranty provision 
the risk levels and historical cost information and failure rates used within this model are reviewed throughout the year and updated as these inputs change over the product s life cycle 
due to the highly technical nature of our light source system products  the newer model light sources and the modules contained within them have higher inherent warranty risks with their initial shipments and require higher warranty provisions until the technology becomes more mature 
we actively engage in product improvement programs and processes to limit our warranty costs  but our warranty obligation is affected by the complexity of our product  product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures at customer sites 
the industry in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change  and as a result  we periodically introduce newer  more complex light sources 
although we classify these newly released light source models as having a higher risk in our warranty model resulting in higher warranty provisions  we are more likely to have differences between the estimated and actual warranty costs for these new products 
this is due to us having limited or no historical product performance data on which to base our future warranty costs 
warranty provisions for our older and more established light source models are more predictable as we have more historical information available on these products 
if actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures were to differ from our estimates  revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas no 
r share based payment  on january  sfas no 
r requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock based compensation awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model and amortize the resulting expense over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting period 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options that we grant under our equity 
table of contents incentive plans 
in order to determine the fair value of stock option grants under the black scholes option pricing model  we must use subjective assumptions including the expected term of the stock options and our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the stock options 
sfas no 
r also requires that a forfeiture rate be estimated and included in the calculation of stock based compensation expense at the time that the stock option or other stock awards such as our restricted stock unit awards are granted and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeiture rates differ from those estimates 
we use a combination of historical and implied volatility blended volatility to determine the expected stock volatility that we include in the black scholes option pricing model to value our stock options 
historical volatility is based on a period commensurate with the expected term of the options 
implied volatility is derived based on six month traded options of our common stock 
the expected term of our stock options represents the period of time options are expected to be outstanding and is based on observed historical exercise patterns for our company which we believe are indicative of future exercise behavior 
we estimate forfeiture rates based on the historical activity for our company which we believe are indicative of future forfeiture rates 
if we change any of the key assumptions that we use in the black scholes option pricing model as described above  or if we decide to use a different valuation model in the future or change our forfeiture rate  the compensation expense that we record under sfas no 
r may differ significantly in the future from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially impact our financial condition and operating results 
our key assumptions such as volatility and the forfeiture rate can be materially impacted during adverse economic conditions such as those we experienced in the second half of and those that we expect to continue into during the first quarter of  we granted performance restricted stock units prsus to our executive officers and certain key employees under our new long term incentive program which became effective on january  prsus are a form of share based award in which the number of shares ultimately received will be determined based on our relative performance compared to a specified group of peer companies over a three year performance period and eligible individual s management by objectives mbo achievement during the same three year performance period 
the value of each prsu is determined on the grant date  based on our stock price  and assumes that performance targets will be achieved 
during each quarter over the three year performance period  we will calculate and record the stock based compensation expense for the prsus using the following estimates our expected performance both revenue growth and net income growth as compared to the specified peer group companies as defined by the plan over the three year period and the expected average percentage achievement of each of the participant s individual mbo goals over the three year period 
the results of these two estimates are used to calculate the expected prsus which will vest at the end of the three year period and the resulting quarterly stock based compensation expense 
at each reporting period  we reassess these estimates and the probability of meeting these goals and adjust our estimated stock based compensation expense accordingly 
if actual results are not consistent with our initial assumptions and judgments used in estimating the forecasted metrics  we may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense  which could materially impact our financial condition and operating results 
allowance for doubtful accounts a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large photo lithography tool manufacturers or semiconductor manufacturers located throughout the world 
in order to monitor potential credit losses  we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectability of all accounts receivable 
we review the allowance for doubtful accounts on 
table of contents a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance 
we take into consideration the following when making this assessment  our customer s payment history and how current they are on paying their outstanding receivables balance  our history of successfully collecting on past due or aged receivables if such exist for our customers  our customer s current financial condition and any circumstances of which we are aware that would impact our customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  and our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and world economy and their impact on our customers 
if circumstances change  and the financial condition of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us or the judgments used by us to determine a customer s allowance prove to be incorrect or inaccurate  we may need to record additional allowances 
in addition  due to the fact that our products are fairly expensive and we deal with a limited customer base  the trade receivable balance owed by any one customer can be significant 
as a result  if our judgment on the financial condition of a our customers  even a single customer  proves to be incorrect  we would have to record additional and potentially significant allowances and bad debt expense which would have a material impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
long lived assets valuation included in our long lived assets are property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets 
we account for the valuation and disposal of our long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived assets  a significant change in the long lived asset s physical condition  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest expected to be generated by the asset 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups 
if such assets are considered to be not recoverable ie carrying amount is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  the impairment is measured and recorded based upon the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
significant judgments and estimates by management are required to project cash flows and  if required  estimate the fair value of the impaired long lived assets 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  our strategic plans with regard to our business and operations  assumptions about expected future operating performance  and the interpretation of current and future economic indicators 
during time periods when the global economy is in a downturn or recession  such as it entered in and in which it remains in  it is very difficult to estimate future cash flows as it requires management at the company to make judgments on when and how quickly the economy and the company s business will recover 
to the extent that the judgments used by us to calculate our future cash flows prove to be inaccurate or there are significant changes in market conditions  the overall condition of the global economy or our strategic plans change  it is possible that our conclusions regarding long lived asset impairment could change 
this could result in significant impairment charges which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the majority of our deferred tax assets 
if in the future we determine that a change has occurred which will not allow this recovery  we will record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
this will result in a charge against our income tax provision 
the calculation of our tax provision is dependant upon the geographic composition of our world wide earnings  tax regulations governing each region and the availability of tax credits 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations 
we recognize these uncertainties based on financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the final payment of the amounts regarding these uncertainties may ultimately prove to be less than or greater than our estimate 
if this occurs there will be either a benefit or a charge to our income tax provision

table of contents we currently operate within two reportable segments  cymer and tcz 
the cymer segment of our business consists of products including photolithography light sources and installed base products 
the tcz segment is targeting the growing market for ltps processing used in the manufacture of flat panel displays 
no sales or revenues were earned or recorded for the years ended december   and for the tcz segment 
as a result  no cost of revenue was recorded for these same years 
the discussion which follows for operating expenses and other income and expenses includes our consolidated expenses and identifies expenses associated with the tcz segment for the years ended december   and additional information regarding our reporting segments is contained in note  segment and geographic information to our consolidated financial statements 
years ended december  and revenues 
the types of revenue that we generate and how we recognize revenue for each is explained above under the heading critical accounting policies and estimates 
the following table summarizes the components of our revenue in thousands  except units sold vs 
years ended december  increase decrease change light source systems revenue units sold average selling price installed base product sales product sales other revenue total revenue for purposes of calculating the average selling price  we have excluded the effect of deferred light source system revenue between periods in order to present the actual average selling price per light source system sold 
total revenue decreased in compared to the decline in revenue was primarily due to a decline in our light source system revenue  which was partially offset by a increase in our installed base product revenue in as compared to a total of light source systems were sold in compared to light source systems sold in the decrease in light source systems revenue was due to the lower number of light source systems that we sold as a result of the reduced need for capacity expansion by our chipmaker customers  the downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry and the deterioration of the global economy 
the average selling price of these light source systems increased to million in from million in this increase in the average selling price is due to the continued adoption of our most advanced arf light sources for high volume immersion production applications which include our xlr series light source system 
on a foreign currency adjusted basis  the average selling price increased from to due to the continued shift in the product mix to our higher priced arf light source systems 
arf light source systems accounted for of light source systems revenue for compared to of light source system revenue for 
table of contents our installed base product revenues increased in from the levels 
these higher revenues from year to year are due to the growth of our installed base and increasing pulse utilization in the first half of  the strong adoption of our onpulse contracts and the sale of other laser productivity enhancements such as glx 
there were no revenues recorded or earned associated with our tcz joint venture in  or we anticipate that our total revenue for the first quarter of will be significantly lower than the fourth quarter levels 
in the first quarter of  demand for new light sources has declined sharply and demand for installed base products is slowing 
due to low chipmaker demand for new lithography tools  coupled with low visibility  we expect our direct customers to continue to draw upon their inventory of light sources to minimize new purchases and preserve cash 
we expect that foundry utilization will remain very low  with higher pulsing memory utilization declining  albeit to a lesser extent 
we expect to see continued decline in lower pulsing krf while arf immersion utilization is expected to continue to rise 
we do not expect the increase in the utilization of arf immersion systems to completely offset the decrease in the utilization of higher pulsing systems for memory lithography and lower pulsing krf sources 
as a result  our installed base products revenue is anticipated to decline substantially in the first quarter of from the fourth quarter levels 
in addition  we anticipate that our revenues throughout will be significantly lower than due to deterioration of the global economy and our expectation that it will not recover in our duv backlog includes only those orders for which we have received a completed purchase order from a customer  and that will be delivered to the customer within the following twelve months 
in addition  our duv backlog does not include services which will be provided to our customers in the future or under service contracts 
for the year ended december   our backlog totaled million and total bookings were million which yielded a book to bill ratio of compared to the year ended december   where our backlog was million and total bookings were million yielding a book to bill ratio of 
the decline in backlog  book to bill and bookings from year to year primarily reflects the downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry as a result of the deterioration of the global economy

gross profit decreased to million for from million for the gross margin on product sales was for compared to for this decrease in gross profit and gross margin in as compared to was primarily due to the increasing percentage of our revenues being attributable to installed base products which generate lower margins 
in addition gross profit and gross margin were negatively impacted by the write down of our inventory values  higher rework expenses  and increased warranty costs for compared to we anticipate that gross margin will be lower in the first quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of a higher mix of our lower margin installed base products revenue and a higher percentage of fixed manufacturing cost relative to lower revenue levels are expected to result in a lower overall gross margin 
we will also record charges that will impact cost of revenues in the first quarter as a result of our january  reduction in workforce 
in addition  if we are not successful in aligning our manufacturing cost structure with our decreasing production levels that are expected in  we may not be able to absorb these costs and this could negatively impact our gross margin on product revenues

table of contents for our investment in research and development is expected to continue as we produce products  such as euv  that can provide us with a competitive advantage in the semiconductor industry 
as a result of the november and january cost reduction actions  we anticipate that our research and development expenses for will be lower than our levels 
research and development expenses for the tcz segment increased to million for from million for  due primarily to an increase in depreciation expense and employee compensation and benefits expenses 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include sales  marketing and other marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for from million for the decrease in sales and marketing expenses is primarily due to a million decline in variable compensation costs associated with our incentive bonus programs  some of which we were able to fund in but did not fund in these decreases in sales and marketing expenses were partially offset by increases in employee related salaries and benefits of million

general and administrative expenses associated with the tcz segment decreased to  for from million for due primarily to a decrease in variable costs associated with the tcz incentive program and a reduction in employee compensation and benefits related expenses 
the reduction in the variable incentive program expenses was due to amounts recorded in the prior year which we reversed in the third quarter of due to changes in tcz s expected results 
table of contents which were identified in the third quarter of these increases in expenses were partially offset by an increase in outside services expense 
total other income expense net 
net other income expense consists primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio  interest expense incurred on our convertible subordinated notes and foreign currency exchange gains and losses associated with fluctuations in the value of the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries against the us dollar 
other expense  net totaled million for compared to other income  net of million for the change from net other income to net other expense from year to year was primarily due to a significant reduction in interest income from year to year as a result of lower overall cash and investment balances and lower interest rate yields and foreign currency exchange losses of million which we recorded during as compared to foreign currency gains of million which we recorded during this change from foreign currency exchange gains to losses from year to year is primarily due to the volatility of the foreign currencies in which our subsidiary offices conduct business as measured against the us dollar 
in the second half of  several of these currencies strengthened against the us dollar  whereas in the second half of  their value  particularly that of the korean won and the euro significantly declined against the us dollar 
to mitigate the risk of future foreign currency exchange exposure  we are expanding our foreign currency hedging program in and transitioning other currency related business practices to be more us dollar centric 
in addition  we recorded a million write down of our investments in related to the sole auction rate security that is included in our investment portfolio and has a par value of million 
based on the continued crisis in the credit market and the significant downgrading of this auction rate security in  our evaluation of its fair value at december  resulted in an other than temporary impairment totaling million 
total other income expense net associated with the tcz segment decreased to a net other expense of  in from a net other income of  in we recorded foreign currency exchange losses of  during as compared to foreign currency exchange gains of  during primarily due to cash balances held by tcz during in non functional currencies such as the euro and singapore dollars

the decrease in the effective rate from to is due to the large investment in the euv technology resulting in a research and development credit on lower profit before tax in the annual effective tax rates for and were less than the us statutory rate of primarily as a result of permanent book tax differences such as the research and development tax credits  and the manufacturing activity deduction under internal revenue code section the deduction 
our future annual effective tax rate depends on various factors  such as potential changes to the tax laws in both the us and foreign jurisdictions and the geographic compositions of our pre tax income 
years ended december  and revenues 
total revenue decreased in to million from million in the decline in revenue was primarily due to lower light source system revenues  which were partially offset by continued growth in our installed base product revenues in as compared to the average selling price of our light source systems increased year over year due to a significant shift by our customers toward our most advanced arf immersion light sources 
the decrease in units of light source systems sold from to reflected the slowing conditions in the semiconductor industry and the reduced need for capacity expansion by our chipmaker customers 

table of contents our installed base product revenue increased to million in from million in these higher revenues from period to period were due to the continued growth in of the installed base of our products and the increased utilization of them by our chipmaker customers

general and administrative 
although general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat at million for both and  the specific types of expenses that contributed to these totals varied from year to year 
general and administrative expenses related to stock compensation expense declined million from to due primarily to million in stock based compensation expense which we recorded in the fourth quarter of related to the correction of an error for a

liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our operations primarily from cash generated from operations  proceeds from note offerings  and proceeds from stock option exercises 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments  million in long term investments  and million in working capital 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in as compared to was primarily due to cash used in operations  and the repurchase of approximately million in shares of our common stock under our board approved stock repurchase program 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities in totaled million and primarily reflects lower net income for the year as adjusted to exclude the effects of non cash charges  a significant increase in inventory levels  decreases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  and changes in the balances of deferred income taxes and income taxes payable 
these uses 
table of contents of cash were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in deferred revenue during the million increase in inventory from to was primarily due to increases in our field inventory to support the growing installed base of our light sources  to provide for faster replacement parts availability and optimize field inventory to support xlr light source system installations and to support our onpulse usage agreements 
the increase in inventory also includes inventory related to our tcz joint venture which is developing flat panel display technologies and euv systems that are currently being built in support of planned production demand in the use of cash in the amount of million for accrued expenses and other liabilities was due primarily to payments made to employees related to amounts earned in under our short term incentive bonus plans that were paid in the first quarter of these short term incentive plans were not funded in so no such payments will be made in the decrease in accounts payable of million primarily reflects the recent reduction in inventory purchases as a result of the downturn in the semiconductor industry and the global economy 
changes in the income tax accounts were primarily due to significant tax payments that were made by us during the year ended december  the decrease in accounts receivable of million was primarily the result of our ongoing collection efforts and lower accounts receivable balances 
the million increase in deferred revenue from to primarily reflects prepayments received from asml during for purchase orders received from them under a multi year euv supply agreement 
net cash provided by operating activities in of million reflects net income  as adjusted to exclude the effects of non cash charges  decreases in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable and deferred revenue 
these were partially offset by the increase in inventory levels from to the decrease in the receivable balance was primarily the result of collection efforts 
the increase in deferred revenue from to primarily reflects prepayments received from asml during the third quarter of for purchase orders received from them under a multi year euv supply agreement 
accounts payable increased from to primarily related to the increased inventory levels at the end of the increase in inventory during was primarily due to the increased production of replacement parts to support and provide service to our growing installed base of light sources 
net cash provided by operating activities in of million reflects significant net income for the year and increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
the increase in accounts receivable was the result of higher revenues recorded during the increase in inventory balances for was primarily the result of an increased demand for replacement parts to support our growing installed base of light source systems  particularly our more advanced xla series systems and the increase in sales of our light source systems 
investment activities net cash used in investing activities in was million  which consisted primarily of the acquisition of million of property and equipment  a significant portion of which relates to building improvement costs and engineering equipment associated with our euv research  development and productization efforts 
this use of cash was offset by proceeds from sold or matured short term and long term securities net of reinvestment of such securities during the year 
a portion of the proceeds from sold and matured investments during the year were used to fund our stock repurchase program 
net cash provided by investing activities in was million  which consisted primarily of proceeds from sold or matured investments  partially offset by purchases of investments and the acquisition of property and equipment used by us in the normal course of business 
a portion of the proceeds from sold and matured investments during the year were used to fund our stock repurchase program 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities was million in and reflects the timing of short term and long term investments that matured and were reinvested during the period  a million payment to acquire the final minority interest in our cymer korea subsidiary  a million payment to acquire certain patent license rights and million in acquired property and equipment 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities for was million which was due primarily to the repurchase of approximately million or  shares of our common stock under our board approved stock repurchase program 
this was partially offset by million in proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan and a million additional cash investment received from zeiss  the tcz minority shareholder 
net cash used in financing activities for was million which was due primarily due to the repurchase of approximately million or million shares of our common stock under our board approved stock repurchase program 
this was slightly offset by the million in proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan a million additional cash investment received from zeiss for our tcz joint venture and million in excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for primarily reflects the proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options as well as the exercise of warrants and proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan totaling million 
in addition  cash from financing activities in was positively affected by the excess tax benefits for the period from stock option exercises which totaled million 
this cash provided by financing activities was offset by the repurchase of treasury stock totaling million during effect of exchange rate changes 
the net effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents  when expressed in us dollar terms  was a decrease in cash of million for the year ended december  compared to an increase in cash of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
most of our foreign subsidiary offices operate in currencies other than the us dollar and the majority of their cash balances are denominated in these foreign currencies 
as a result  our cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to the effects of the fluctuations in these currencies against the us dollar at the end of each reporting period 
since the beginning of and most notably in the second half of  several of the foreign currencies in which our subsidiary offices operate fluctuated significantly against the us dollar 
the most volatile of these currencies during was the korean won  and to a lesser extent  the euro 
not only did the korean won weaken dramatically against the us dollar during the year  but we had significant cash balances denominated in korean won as of december  as a result  cash and cash equivalents were negatively impacted by million due to the korean won weakening during the year 
this decrease was offset by the strengthening of the japanese yen against the us dollar during as a result  the cash and cash equivalents were positively impacted by million due to the japanese yen strengthening during the year 
for the year ended december   cash was positively impacted by million primarily due to the japanese yen and the euro strengthening against the us dollar and the impacts it had on the cash balances denominated in these currencies held at our subsidiary offices

prospective capital needs 
we require substantial resources to fund the operations of our business  particularly to fund our investment in new light source technologies  including inventory and capital in support of these technologies 
in addition  we require resources to fund our normal operations and the activities of our tcz joint venture 
on february   we used million of 
table of contents our total cash and short term investments balances to redeem our convertible subordinated notes and the remaining interest due 
as a result  our total cash and investment balances will be much lower in than they were at december  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with cash generated from operations and  to a lesser extent  from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase by our employees of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan  will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs for our normal operations  our investments in our new light source technologies and our tcz venture for at least the next months 
it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities  to acquire assets  products or new technologies beyond the next months 
we may also decide that it is prudent in the current business and economic environment to secure commitments to access additional capital  including equity or debt securities  to protect our long term liquidity position 
we have taken steps to reduce certain expenditures as part of our announced reduction in workforce on january   and we will continue to monitor expenditures for this purpose 
on april   our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
as of december  we have million remaining of this authorization 
we are currently not using our cash or marketable securities for common stock repurchases  but we could do so in the future 
while we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned 
we anticipate that the amount of capital we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets in which we operate  including the continuing volatility in the semiconductor industry  the current economic recession  trends in the semiconductor markets in various geographic regions  including seasonality in sales of consumer products into which our products are incorporated  our manufacturing activity  the required investments in our new light source technologies such as euv  the timing and requirements of spending to support product development efforts and other operating costs  competitive labor market compensation requirements the inability of certain of our customers who depend on credit to have access to their traditional sources of credit to finance the purchase of products from us  particularly in the current global economic environment  which may lead them to reduce their level of purchases or to seek credit or other accommodations from us  the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins  the market acceptance of our products  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  acquisitions of assets  products or new technologies  capital improvements for new and existing facilities  our competitors responses to our products and our anticipation of and responses to their products  our relationships with suppliers and customers  and the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases by our employees under our employee stock purchase plan 

table of contents subsequent events reduction in work force and actions to lower global cost structure 
on january   we reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately percent  or a total of approximately employees  in response to continuing deterioration in the lithography sector of the semiconductor capital equipment market 
as a result of this reduction in workforce  we expect to incur cash charges of approximately million  primarily for severance  that will be recorded in our consolidated financial statements for the three months ending march  in connection with this reduction in workforce  the compensation committee of our board of directors also reduced the annual salaries of certain executive officers by effective january  in addition  we took various other cost reduction actions for including reducing all other employees salaries by  suspending our k company matching program and contributions to certain of our subsidiary office pension plans  suspending annual salary increases and our short term bonus plan and significantly reducing non essential operating and capital expenditures 
we expect that all of these actions will result in lower overall costs in convertible subordinated notes on february   we redeemed the convertible subordinated notes at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes of million plus accrued interest of million 
we anticipate that this payment will not impact our ability to sustain operations for at least the next months 
transactions with related parties we periodically sell our light source systems to zeiss and we purchase certain optical parts from zeiss

contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments as of december   and the impact such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations convertible subordinated notes interest on convertible subordinated notes purchase obligations total commitments we currently sublease all or a portion of our leased facilities  and the payments received under these non cancelable subleases agreements which expire in are direct offsets to our operating lease obligations 
the amounts in the table above represent the gross lease amounts  which are expected to be offset by sublease payments of million in purchase obligations declined by approximately million from december  due primarily to the downturn in the semiconductor industry and the adverse global economic conditions 
in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  at december   we had a gross liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions of approximately million 
because 
table of contents the timing of any payments which could result from these unrecognized tax benefits will depend on a number of factors  we are unable to project if and when this might occur if at all within the next five years 
accordingly  we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the amount and period of potential cash settlements  if any  with taxing authorities 
at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  variable interest  or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we did not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we conduct business in several currencies through our global operations 
until the beginning of  our japanese subsidiary posed our greatest foreign currency risk due to the large volume of business that we conduct in japan and the volatility of the japanese yen 
in our exposure to foreign currency risks associated with our other international subsidiary offices increased  and most notably in korea and the netherlands due to the increase in intercompany activities and the volatility of the korean won and the euro against the us dollar 
these foreign currency exposures primarily related to the us dollar intercompany payable balances recorded at these offices which grew significantly in as we strategically increased our investment in field inventory at these locations in support of world class customer parts availability 
in the third quarter of  these higher intercompany balances combined with the significant decline in the value of the korean won and the 
table of contents euro against the us dollar resulted in significant foreign currency losses for the period 
during the fourth quarter of  the korean won continued to deteriorate against the us dollar  however  the strengthening of the japanese yen and the resulting foreign currency gains partially offset the foreign currency losses incurred for the korean won during the period 
our risk management includes the use of derivative financial instruments  principally forward contracts  purchased to manage the foreign currency risk exposure at our japanese subsidiary 
we enter into forward contracts in order to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations related to purchases of our products by cymer japan in us dollars for resale under firm third party sales commitments denominated in japanese yen  as well as exposures related to intercompany debt and other foreign currency exposures 
as a result of our recent increase in foreign currency exposures  we are expanding our foreign currency hedging program to include balance sheet hedging at other international subsidiaries 
we launched this balance sheet hedging program in february at our korean subsidiary and plan to implement it at other international subsidiaries during as is the case with the forward contracts for cymer japan  our objective is to offset gains or losses resulting from foreign exchange exposures with gains and losses on forward contracts  thereby reducing the volatility of our earnings 
we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes 
our foreign exchange hedging program may not be adequate to eliminate the impact of our exchange rate exposure 
failure to sufficiently hedge or otherwise manage such foreign currency risks properly could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
at december  and  we had outstanding forward contracts to buy us million for billion yen and million for billion yen  respectively  under foreign currency exchange facilities 
at december   the contract rates ranged from yen to yen per us dollar 
these contracts expire on various dates through june we enter into forward contracts to hedge anticipated product purchases that are denominated in a currency different than the functional currency and these qualify for hedge accounting treatment per the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as a result  we defer changes in the fair value for the effective portion of these forward contract hedges and record the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
subsequently we reclassify the gain or loss to cost of product sales in the same period that the related sale is made to the third party 
we also enter into forward contracts to offset gains and losses arising from holding assets and liabilities in the non functional currencies 
these forward contracts are not designated as hedges under sfas and we record changes in their fair value to other income expense  in order to offset the changes in fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities denominated in the non functional currencies 
the fair value of all of our forward contracts totaled to a liability of million as of december  and an asset of  as of december  the deferred loss  net of tax  for those that qualified for hedge accounting treatment was  for the year ended december  compared to a deferred gain  net of tax  of  for the year ended december  the foreign currency exchange loss totaled approximately million for the year ended december  and the foreign currency exchange gain totaled approximately million for the year ended december  the foreign currency loss for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a significant decline in the korean won against the us dollar 
the foreign currency gain for the year ended december  primarily reflected strengthening of the japanese yen and the euro against the us dollar during the year 
these foreign currency gains and losses were primarily associated with 
table of contents our intercompany balances and were included in other income expense  net on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of for all currencies could be experienced in the near term 
these changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the adverse impact at december  and december  is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately million and million from forward exchange contracts in place for the months of december and december  respectively 
these reasonably possible adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of were applied to net assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before taxes in the near term 
investment and debt risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting primarily of government and corporate fixed income securities  certificates of deposit and commercial paper 
while it is our general intent to hold such securities until maturity  we will occasionally sell certain securities for cash flow purposes 
therefore  our investments are classified as available for sale and are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
a change in market interest rates of would have impacted our net income from these investments by approximately  for the year ended december  we also currently hold one auction rate security within our investment portfolio which was purchased according to our investment policy in october at a par value of million 
although this auction rate security is insured  the company that insures it was significantly downgraded in the first and second quarters of as a result of the downgrading of the company that insures this auction rate security  the auction rate security itself was also downgraded 
this auction rate security has gone to auction every days since november and has failed at every auction 
as a result of these failed auctions  the downgrading of the auction rate security and the company that insures it  and the current credit market crisis  we have recorded impairment charges on this investment totaling million  to properly reflect its fair value at december  of this impairment  million was identified and recorded in the three months ended march   million in the three months ended june    in the three months ended september  and  in the three months ended december  no impairment charges were recorded in the year ended december  the impairment charges recorded in the first and second quarters of were primarily due to the downgrading of the auction rate security itself and the company that insures it  whereas the impairment charges recorded in the third and fourth quarters of were due to the increase in the key interest rates used in the model  primarily those associated with credit default swaps  to calculate the fair value of the auction rate security 
since we determined that these were all other than temporary impairments  we recorded these as a write down of investments in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
it is uncertain that we will be able to liquidate this auction rate security in the near term and the likelihood is high that we will hold this auction rate security in excess of twelve months from the current reporting period date of december  therefore  we have classified the  fair value of this auction rate security as a long term investment on our consolidated balance sheet at december  since this auction rate security is immaterial to our overall cash and investment balances  we do not anticipate that our inability to liquidate it at its current fair value in the near term or long term will have an affect on our liquidity 
in february  we issued million principal amount of unsecured fixed rate convertible subordinated notes which became due and were retired on february  interest on 
table of contents these notes was payable on february and august of each year 
the notes were convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount and were subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
because the interest rate was fixed  there was no risk of increased expense 
we repurchased  at a discount to par  million of these notes reducing the principal amount outstanding to million at december  and the fair value of such debt based on quoted market prices at december  and was million and million  respectively
