overview we are a neuromodulation company founded to design  develop and bring to market medical devices that provide a unique therapy  vns therapy  for the treatment of epilepsy  depression and other disorders as approved by the applicable regulatory bodies 

table of contents our ability to successfully expand the commercialization of the vns therapy system depends on obtaining and maintaining favorable insurance coverage  coding and reimbursement for the device  the implant procedure and follow up care 
currently  we have broad coverage  coding and reimbursement for vns therapy for the treatment of refractory epilepsy 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services  cms  which we estimate pays for approximately of the vns therapy implants  issues an annual update to the reimbursement amounts received by our customers 
recently  medicare made significant changes to the amounts that are reimbursed to hospitals for the generator and the lead  effective on january  these changes include an increase from  to  in the amount paid for generator  and a decrease from  to  in the amount paid for a lead and the insertion procedure 
the reimbursement rates will vary depending on geographic area 
we continue to work with the cms to insure favorable and appropriate reimbursement for our products and related procedures  however  these changes and other potential changes in the future could have a long term adverse impact on our ability to procure sales to hospitals  as well as an adverse impact on our business and our future operating results 
our clinical development program has included pilot and pivotal studies in using vns therapy a as an adjunctive therapy for reducing the frequency of seizures in patients over years of age with partial onset seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic drugs and b as an adjunctive treatment for patients years of age and older with chronic or recurrent depression who are in a major depressive episode 
we have also conducted or provided support for small pilot studies for the use of vns therapy in the treatment of alzheimer s disease  anxiety  bulimia  fibromyalgia  obesity  obsessive compulsive disorder  multiple sclerosis and other indications 
these studies have been conducted to determine the safety and effectiveness of vns therapy in these new indications and to determine which new indications might be considered for pivotal studies 
since inception  we have incurred substantial expenses  primarily for research and development activities that include product and process development  clinical studies and related regulatory activities  sales and marketing activities  manufacturing start up costs and systems infrastructure 
as of april   we incurred an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the primary exchange rate movements that impact our consolidated net sales growth include the us dollar as compared to the euro and the british pound 
the strengthening of the us dollar generally has an unfavorable impact on our sales for the year 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net sales is not indicative of the impact on our operations due to the offsetting foreign currency impact on operating costs and expenses 
proceedings related to stock option grants and practices regulatory proceedings 
in june  the staff of the sec advised us that it had commenced an informal inquiry of some of our stock option grants  and we received a subpoena from the office of the us attorney for the southern district of new york requesting documents related to our stock option grants  practices and procedures 
in october  the sec staff made an additional request for certain documents and information related to our revised guidance on february  and our financial results announced on may   our sales for the quarter ended april   coverage or potential coverage of our vns therapy system by bluecross blueshield of alabama and aetna and the aging of our accounts receivable since january  we are cooperating with the sec staff and the us attorney s office 
at the direction of our board  our audit committee  with the assistance of its independent counsel and counsel s forensic accountants  completed a review of our stock option grants  practices and procedures  including compliance with us gaap and all applicable statutes  rules and regulations 
our audit committee concluded that incorrect measurement dates were used for certain stock option grants made principally during the period from through based on our audit committee s investigation  subsequent internal analysis and discussions with our independent registered public accountants  our board concluded on november   that we needed to restate certain of our historical consolidated financial statements to record non cash charges for compensation expense relating to past stock option grants 
the effects of these restatements are reflected in the consolidated financial statements  including unaudited quarterly data 
none of the restatements have any impact on net cash provided by used in operating activities 

table of contents we had been under a limited scope audit by the internal revenue service irs in connection with our stock option activity 
in october we received a final close out notice from the irs regarding the examination which stated that no changes to the tax we reported were made 
significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap 
our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in note summary of significant accounting policies and related data in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  in conformity with gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
our estimates and assumptions are updated as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we base our estimates on historical experience or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies as the most significant because  in management s view  they are most important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial position and results of operations and most demanding in terms of requiring estimates and other exercises of judgment 
accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon specific customer risks and general historical trends 
an increase in losses beyond that expected by management or what we have historically experienced would reduce earnings when they become known 
inventories 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost  the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
our calculation of cost includes the acquisition cost of raw materials and components  direct labor and overhead 
management considers potential obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
an acceleration of obsolescence could occur if consumer demand differs from expectations 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are carried at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
maintenance  repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred  significant renewals  improvements and expansions are capitalized 
for financial reporting purposes  we compute depreciation using the straight line method over useful lives ranging from two to nine years 
an unanticipated change in the utilization or expected useful life of property and equipment could result in acceleration in the timing of the expenses 
leases 
financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases fas establishes standards of financial accounting and reporting for leases by lessees and lessors 
we are a party to the contract of leased facilities and other lease obligations recorded in compliance with fas the lease terms provide for tenant improvement allowances that are recorded as deferred rent and amortized  using the straight line method  as reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease 
scheduled rent increases and rent holidays are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
during fiscal year we surrendered a portion of our leased facilities at cyberonics boulevard in houston texas 
we record the net present value of our future lease obligations related to the space surrendered  offset by the net present value of estimated proceeds from the sub lease of the space surrendered 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when title to the goods and risk of loss transfer to customers  providing there are no remaining performance obligations required of us or any matters requiring customer acceptance 
we record estimated sales returns and discounts as a reduction of net sales in the same period revenue is recognized 
our net sales are dependent upon sales to new and existing customers pursuant to our current policies 
changes in these policies or sales terms could impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized 

table of contents licensing revenue 
we evaluate our license agreements and recognize licensing revenue considering the guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin sab topic  revenue recognition  eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  regulation s x rule b sales and revenue  eitf income statement characterization of reimbursement of out of pocket expenses and other regulations as applicable 
licensing expense 
we have executed license agreements under which we have secured the rights provided under certain patents 
royalties payable under the terms of these agreements are expensed as incurred 
research and development 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we have entered into contractual obligations for the conduct of clinical studies 
costs are incurred over the duration of the studies and paid under the terms of the contracts 
research and development expenses could vary significantly due to possible changes in the timing of clinical activity 
stock options 
we account for our employee stock based compensation plans under fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment fas r 
under fas r the fair value of compensatory stock options is determined using the black scholes option valuation model  which is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
total compensation cost for the weeks ended april  for stock options was approximately million 
as of april   there was approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options that are expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of years 
restricted stock  restricted stock units and other share based awards 
we may grant restricted stock  restricted stock units or stock awards to directors  officers and key employees which have no purchase cost to the grantee 
nonvested restricted stock entitles the grantees to dividends  if any  and voting rights for their respective shares 
sale or transfer of the shares is restricted until they are vested 
typically  grants are service based and vest ratably over the service period of four to five years  or cliff vest after three years  as required under the agreement establishing the grant 
compensation cost is expensed ratably over the service period 
generally  the fair value of restricted stock is determined for accounting purposes using the market closing price on the grant date 
we also grant restricted stock subject to performance or market conditions that can vest based on the satisfaction of the conditions of the grant 
the fair market value and derived service period of market condition based grants is determined using the monte carlo simulation method 
the derived service period for performance based grants is estimated based on our judgment of likely future performance 
the monte carlo simulation method is subject to variability as several factors utilized must be estimated  including the derived service period  which is estimated based on our judgment of likely future performance  and our stock price volatility 
we issue new shares for the granting of restricted stock 
total compensation cost for the weeks ended april  related to grants of restricted stock was approximately million 
as of april   there was approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost related to grants of restricted stock that is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of years 
foreign currency translation 
the assets and liabilities of our subsidiary  cyberonics europe  sa  are generally translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect on reporting dates  while capital accounts are translated at historical rates 
statements of operations items are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the financial statement period 
the gains and losses that result from this process are shown in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss section of stockholders equity deficit and comprehensive income loss and are not included in the determination of the results of operations 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions denominated in currency other than the functional currency are included in other income and expense 

table of contents income taxes 
we account for income taxes under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes fas 
under this method  deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between financial accounting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
such differences relate primarily to the deductibility of certain accruals and reserves and the effect of tax loss and tax credit carryforwards not yet utilized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
fas requires that deferred tax assets are to be reduced by a valuation allowance if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
therefore  we maintained a valuation allowance for most of our deferred tax assets for the weeks ended april  because historically we have experienced significant operating losses and operate in an industry subject to rapid technological change 
we have achieved profitability in the current year and expect to continue to be profitable in the next fiscal year 
we continue to evaluate the future realization of our deferred tax assets based on expectations of future taxable income 
depending on our continued ability to achieve expected levels of profitability  we may have sufficient evidence in future quarters of fiscal year to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will recognize the value of our deferred tax assets  in whole or in part  in fiscal year to the extent the valuation allowance is reversed a benefit will be recorded in our consolidated results of operations 
effective april   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
this interpretation clarifies the criteria for recognizing income tax benefits under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  and requires additional disclosures about uncertain tax positions 
under fin  the financial statement recognition of the benefit for a tax position is dependent upon the benefit being more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable taxing authority 
if this threshold is met  the tax benefit is then measured and recognized at the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
results of operations net sales we sell vns therapy systems to hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers ascs for both epilepsy and depression indications  but we often do not know the intended use for a specific vns therapy system at the time of its sale 
as a result  we use information available from two separate internal databases to estimate our sales by indication for use 
the fda has designated our vns therapy system  which is a class iii implantable medical device  as a tracked device under the fda s medical device tracking regulation 
consistent with the tracking regulation  we urge each implanting hospital or asc to complete and return to us an implant card that provides information from which we can identify the corresponding indication for use 
we maintain the returned information in an implant card database 
separately  we accumulate information relating to prospective and actual patients  prescribing and implanting physicians  and hospitals and ascs in a sales related database 
we do not receive an implant card for each device we sell  and we sometimes sell devices that are not the subject of data included in our sales related database 
in addition  the delay between the date of a sale and the date of receipt of the corresponding implant card may result in an implant card being received in a fiscal quarter subsequent to the fiscal quarter corresponding to the date of the sale 
we assume that any delay  however  will affect each fiscal quarter by approximately the same extent 
by combining information derived from both the tracking and sales related databases  we form an estimate of the split between units and net sales for the epilepsy and depression indications 
the accuracy of our estimates of sales by indication for use  however  may vary from one fiscal quarter to the next  and investors should exercise caution in relying on these estimates

there was no licensing revenue recognized during fiscal year gross profit the gross profit for product sales for fiscal year was of net sales  compared to for fiscal year and for fiscal year the increase in gross profit margin for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily a result of increased production volume resulting in increased manufacturing efficiency and higher average selling prices 
the decrease in gross profit margin for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily a result of a decreased production volume resulting in decreased manufacturing efficiency 
cost of products sold consists primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  third party contractor costs  royalties and the acquisition cost of raw materials and components 
we are obligated to pay royalties at a rate of approximately of net sales 
based upon the mix between us and international sales  direct and distributor sales  the vns therapy system selling price  applicable royalty rates and the levels of production volume  gross profit may fluctuate in future periods

factors affecting future operating results and common stock price the factors affecting our future operating results and common stock prices are disclosed in item a 
risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk on interest rates  foreign currency exchange rate risk  and our convertible notes risk 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments 
we do not hedge our interest rate exposure or invest in derivative securities 
based upon the average outstanding balances in cash  cash equivalents and our line of credit  a basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
foreign currency exchange rate risk due to the global reach of our business  we are also exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly with respect to the us dollar versus the euro and the british pound 
our wholly owned foreign subsidiary is consolidated into our financial results and is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially impacted by changes in these or other factors 
at this time  we have not deemed it to be cost effective to engage in a program of hedging the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our operating results using derivative financial instruments 
a sensitivity analysis indicates that  if the us dollar uniformly weakened against the euro  the effect upon net income recorded during fiscal year would be favorable by approximately million  or 
conversely  if the us dollar uniformly strengthened against the euro  the impact on our operations would be unfavorable by approximately million  or 
the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for the fiscal year represented an unfavorable impact of in our international sales as compared to fiscal year 
table of contents convertible notes risk the estimated fair value of our convertible notes was approximately million  based on the outstanding liability of approximately million as of april  because we pay fixed interest coupons on the convertible notes  market interest rate fluctuations do not impact our debt interest payments 
however  the fair value of our convertible notes will fluctuate as a result of changes in the price of our common stock  changes in market interest rates  changes in our credit worthiness  and changes in the overall credit market 
generally  the fair market value of our convertible notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of our convertible notes may also increase as the market price of our common stock rises and decrease as the market price of our common stock falls 
at april   a decrease in the price of our common stock would have resulted in a decrease of approximately  on the fair value of our convertible notes  and a increase in the price of our common stock would have resulted in an increase of approximately  on the fair value of our convertible notes 
to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements  fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  requires that the inputs used to measure fair value be categorized into levels 
there are three levels in the hierarchy 
the highest level  or level  is an unadjusted market quote from an active market for identical assets or liabilities  level are inputs to the fair value measurement that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  and level are inputs that are unobservable 
assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  considering factors specific to the asset or liability 
we believe that the fair value measurement of our convertible notes fall into level
