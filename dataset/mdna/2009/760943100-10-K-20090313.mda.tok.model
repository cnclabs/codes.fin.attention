our business we receive revenues primarily from the delivery of residential  training  educational and support services to various populations with special needs 
as of december   we had three reportable operating segments i community services  ii job corps training services and iii employment training services 
management s discussion and analysis of each segment is included below 
further information regarding our segments is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues for our community services operations are derived primarily from state medicaid programs  other government agencies  commercial insurance companies and from management contracts with private operators  
table of contents generally not for profit providers  who contract with state government agencies and are also reimbursed under the medicaid program 
our services include social  functional and vocational skills training  supported employment and emotional and psychological counseling for individuals with intellectual or other disabilities 
we also provide respite  therapeutic and other services to individuals with special needs and to older people in their homes 
these services are provided on an as needed basis or hourly basis through our periodic in home services programs that are reimbursed on a unit of service basis 
reimbursement varies by state and service type  and may be based on a variety of methods including flat rate  cost based reimbursement  per person per diem  or unit of service basis 
generally  rates are adjusted annually based upon historical costs experienced by us and by other service providers  or economic conditions and their impact on state budgets 
at facilities and programs where we are the provider of record  we are directly reimbursed under state medicaid programs for services we provide and such revenues are affected by occupancy levels 
at most facilities and programs that we operate pursuant to management contracts  the management fee is negotiated with the provider of record 
through rescare homecare  we also provide in home services to seniors on a private pay basis 
we are concentrating growth efforts in the home care private pay business to further diversify our revenue streams 
we operate vocational training centers under the federal job corps program administered by the dol through our job corps training services operations 
under job corps contracts  we are reimbursed for direct facility and program costs related to job corps center operations  allowable indirect costs for general and administrative costs  plus a predetermined management fee 
the management fee takes the form of a fixed contractual amount plus a computed amount based on certain performance criteria 
all of such amounts are reflected as revenue  and all such direct costs are reflected as facility and program costs 
final determination of amounts due under job corps contracts is subject to audit and review by the dol  and renewals and extension of job corps contracts are based in part on performance reviews 
we operate job training and placement programs that assist disadvantaged job seekers in finding employment and improving their career prospects through our employment training services operations 
these programs are administered under contracts with local and state governments 
we are typically reimbursed for direct facility and program costs related to the job training centers  allowable indirect costs plus a fee for profit 
the fee can take the form of a fixed contractual amount rate or price or be computed based on certain performance criteria 
the contracts are funded by federal agencies  including the dol and dhhs 
application of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development  selection  and application of our critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
valuation of accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from medicaid programs  other government agencies and commercial insurance companies 
an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is recorded to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
in evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable  we consider a number of factors  including historical loss rates  age of the accounts  changes in collection patterns  the status of ongoing disputes with third party payors  general economic conditions and the status of state budgets 
complex rules and regulations regarding billing and timely filing requirements in various states are also a factor in our assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
actual collections of accounts 
table of contents receivable in subsequent periods may require changes in the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in these estimates are charged or credited to the results of operations in the period of the change of estimate 
there were no material changes in our method of providing for reserves for doubtful accounts during insurance losses we self insure a substantial portion of our professional  general and automobile liability  workers compensation and health benefit risks 
these liabilities are necessarily based on estimates and  while we believe that the provision for loss is adequate  the ultimate liability may be more or less than the amounts recorded 
provisions for losses for workers compensation risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates and include an amount determined from reported claims and an amount based on past experiences for losses incurred but not reported 
estimates of workers compensation claims reserves have been discounted using a discount rate of approximately at december  and the liabilities are reviewed quarterly and any adjustments are reflected in earnings in the period known 
there were no material changes to our method of providing reserves for insurance risks during legal contingencies we are party to numerous claims and lawsuits with respect to various matters 
the material legal proceedings in which rescare is currently involved are described in item of this report and note to the consolidated financial statements 
we provide for costs related to contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount is reasonably determinable 
we confer with outside counsel in estimating our potential liability for certain legal contingencies 
while we believe our provision for legal contingencies is adequate  the outcome of legal proceedings is difficult to predict and we may settle legal claims or be subject to judgments for amounts that exceed our estimates 
there were no material changes to our method of providing reserves for legal contingencies during valuation of long lived assets we regularly review the carrying value of long lived assets with respect to any events or circumstances that indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
indicators of impairment include  but are not limited to  loss of contracts  significant census declines  reductions in reimbursement levels and significant litigation 
our evaluation is based on cash flow  profitability and projections that incorporate current or projected operating results  as well as significant events or changes in the reimbursement and regulatory environment 
if circumstances suggest the recorded amounts cannot be recovered  the carrying values of such assets are reduced to fair value based upon various techniques to estimate fair value 
during  we recorded asset impairment charges totaling million in connection with our withdrawal from the district of columbia district and the state of new mexico 
these changes  which were primarily related to the write down of leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment  are reported as part of discontinued operations 
we recorded an impairment loss of million in the fourth quarter of related to a building operated under our community services segment 
no asset valuation losses were recorded in goodwill with respect to businesses we have acquired  we evaluate the costs of purchased businesses in excess of net assets acquired goodwill for impairment at least annually as of year end  unless significant changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment may have occurred sooner 
we are required to test goodwill on a reporting unit basis 
we use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment and recognize an impairment charge for the amount  if any  by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
fair values are established using a weighted average of comparative market multiples in the current market conditions and discounted cash flows 

table of contents discounted cash flow computations depend on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies market multiplies in valuing our reporting units  as well as certain assumptions to allocate shared assets and liabilities to calculate values for each of reporting units 
no impairment loss was recognized as a result of the impairment tests in or  however  a million impairment loss was recorded in march related to the schools component of our all other reporting segment 
revenue recognition overview we recognize revenues as they are realizable and earned in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab requires that revenue can only be recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
community services 
revenues are derived primarily from state medicaid programs  other government agencies  commercial insurance companies and from management contracts with private operators  generally not for profit providers  who contract with state agencies and are also reimbursed under the medicaid programs 
revenues are recorded at rates established at or before the time services are rendered 
revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered 
depending upon the state s reimbursement policies and practices  management contract fees are computed on the basis of a fixed fee per individual  which may include some form of incentive payment  a percentage of operating expenses cost plus contracts  a percentage of revenue or an overall fixed fee paid regardless of occupancy 
job corps training services 
revenues include amounts reimbursable under cost reimbursement contracts with the dol for operating job corps centers for education and training programs 
depending upon the state s reimbursement policies and practices  management contract fees are computed on the basis of a fixed fee per individual  which may include some form of incentive payment  a percentage of operating expenses cost plus contracts  a percentage of revenue or an overall fixed fee paid regardless of occupancy 
revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered 
the contracts provide reimbursement for direct facility and program costs related to operations  allowable indirect costs for general and administrative costs  plus a predetermined management fee  normally a combination of fixed and performance based 
final determination of amounts due under the contracts is subject to audit and review by the applicable government agencies 
revenue is recognized in the period associated costs are incurred and services are rendered 
employment training services 
revenues are derived primarily through contracts with local and state governments funded by federal agencies 
revenue is generated from contracts which contain various pricing arrangements  including cost reimbursable  performance based  hybrid and fixed price 
with cost reimbursable contracts  revenue is recognized for the direct costs associated with functions that are specific to the contract  plus an indirect cost percentage that is applied to the direct costs  plus a profit 
revenue is recognized in the period the associated costs are incurred and services are rendered 
under a performance based contract  revenue is generally recognized as earned based upon the attainment of a unit performance measure times the fixed unit price for that specific performance measure 
typically  there are many different performance measures that are stipulated in the contract that must be tracked to support the billing and revenue recognition 
revenue may be recognized prior to achieving a benchmark as long as reliable measurements of progress to date activity can be obtained  indicating that it is probable that the benchmark will be achieved 
this requires judgment in determining what is considered to be a reliable measurement 

table of contents revenues for hybrid contracts are generally recognized based on the specific contract language 
the most common type of hybrid contract is cost plus  which provide for the reimbursement of direct and indirect costs with profit tied to meeting certain performance measures 
revenues for cost plus contracts are generally recognized in the period the associated costs are incurred with an estimate made for the performance based portion  as long as reliable measurements of progress to date activity can be obtained  indicating that it is probable that the benchmark will be achieved 
this requires judgment in determining what is considered to be a reliable measurement 
revenues for fixed price contracts are generally recognized in the period services are rendered 
certain of our long term fixed price contracts may contain performance based measures that can increase or decrease our revenue 
revenue is deferred in cases where the fixed price is not determinable as a result of these provisions 
laws and regulations governing the government programs and contracts are complex and subject to interpretation 
as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change by a material amount in the near term 
for each operating segment  expenses are subject to examination by agencies administering the contracts and services 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made for potential adjustments arising from such examinations 
there were no material changes in the application of our revenue recognition policies during results of operations year ended december dollars in thousands revenues community services job corps training services employment training services other consolidated operating income community services job corps training services employment training services other total operating expenses consolidated operating margin community services job corps training services employment training services other total operating expenses consolidated excludes results for washington  dc and new mexico  which were reclassified to discontinued operations for all years presented

consolidated revenues increased million  or in from revenues are more fully described in the segment discussions below 
consolidated operating income decreased in from operating margin decreased from in to in the reductions in operating income and margin were primarily related to the million legal charge recorded in to resolve four legal matters in the community services segment 
the consolidated operating income increased million  or  primarily due to acquisitions in the community services segment 
operating margin decreased from in to in primarily due to higher share based compensation 
operating income is discussed further in the segment sections which follow 
as a percentage of total revenues  total operating expenses were in  in and in the and percentages were slightly higher due primarily to increases in depreciation expense 
net interest expense increased million in  compared to  due primarily to higher average debt balances 
the net interest expense was million higher than our effective income tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate benefited from increases in job credits  offset by an increase in valuation allowances associated with foreign operations 
the effective tax rate is lower than due primarily to the impact of reversing a valuation allowance related to net operating losses due to certain tax law changes in texas 
community services community services revenues increased in over due primarily to acquisition growth 
in  our community services segment acquired operations with annual revenues of million 
operating margin decreased from in to in due primarily to the million legal charge for the resolution of four legal matters 
revenues increased in over due primarily to acquisitions and growth in periodic in home services 
in  this segment acquired operations with annual revenues of million 
operating margins decreased from in to in as a result of higher share based compensation and insurance related costs  as well as lower overall margins associated with our kelly home care services acquisition and pharmacy business job corps training services job corps training services revenues remained consistent between and  and increased in over the increase was primarily due to contractual increases 
operating margins were  and for  and  respectively 
in january  we were informed that the contract to operate the pittsburgh job corps center had been awarded to another operator through the re bidding process 
annual revenues for this contract were approximately million 
an appeal with the dol was denied 
we are in the process of determining whether to file an additional appeal with the general accounting office 
our contract currently expires on april  employment training services employment training services revenue increased million in compared to  due primarily to the ramping up of the arizona and indiana contracts and new contracts in texas  arkansas and south carolina  which were partially offset by lost contracts in florida due to certain workforce investment boards taking services in house 
operating margin improved from in to in due primarily to a increase in margin due to improvement in performance in the new york city back to work contract and a increase in margin for incentives received in the calworks programs 
employment training services revenue decreased million in compared to  due primarily to contract non renewals and concessions in modifications to existing contracts in in particular  two significant contracts were not renewed when their terms ended shortly after they were acquired in january operating margin 
table of contents improved from in to in due to achieving certain performance incentives  the loss of a very low margin contract  stricter monitoring of expenses  and slightly lower share based compensation costs 
other a portion of our business is dedicated to operating charter schools and international job training and placement agencies 
revenues increased million or from to due primarily to acquisition growth in the schools and international business 
operating margins decreased from in to in due primarily to integration costs associated with the international acquisitions 
revenues decreased million from to primarily due to a lost school contract in florida 
operating margins improved from in to in due to higher costs related to international job training contracts 
discontinued operations net loss from discontinued operations was million for and and million in included in net loss from discontinued operations in is a pre tax charge of million for impaired assets and abandoned leased facilities and a pretax operational loss of million  offset by a tax benefit of million 
the discontinued operations relate to the community services segment s exit from the district of columbia and the state of new mexico  which were effective on march  and october   respectively 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources total assets increased million  or  in over this increase was due primarily as a result of the acquisitions  which caused goodwill and other intangibles to increase million from december  cash and cash equivalents were million at december   compared to million at december  cash provided by operating activities for was million compared to million for and million for the increase from to was primarily due to improved collection efforts in accounts receivable  as well as an increase in net income 
the decrease from to was primarily related to lower net income due principally to the million legal charge and the result of funding working capital requirements for the acquired operations 
days revenue in net accounts receivable were days at december  compared with days at december  and days at december  the increase in the number of days is due primarily to one state adopting a new voucher system and payment delays by certain insurance payors 
net accounts receivable at december  increased to million  compared to million at december  and million at december  the increase in net accounts receivable from to is primarily due to revenue growth associated with acquisitions 
approximately  and of the total net accounts receivable balance was greater than days at december   december  and december   respectively 
our capital requirements relate primarily to our plans to expand through selective acquisitions and the development of new facilities and programs  and our need for sufficient working capital for general corporate purposes 
since most of our facilities and programs are operating at or near capacity  and budgetary pressures and other forces are expected to limit increases in reimbursement rates we receive  our ability to continue to grow at the current rate depends directly on our acquisition and development activity 
we have historically satisfied our working capital requirements  capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments from our operating cash flow and borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
the capital markets remain under duress due to the ongoing financial crisis which may impede our ability to expand and grow our business if credit conditions remain tight or our access to these markets becomes limited 
state budgetary pressures from the financial crisis may put further pressure on reimbursement rates and limit our ability to receive rate increases 
we expect to begin negotiating new terms for our million senior secured revolving 
table of contents credit facility during the second half of and anticipate facing significant rate and pricing increases as well as more restrictive debt covenants over the terms in place currently 
some members of our current bank lending group  due to pressure from the financial crisis  may have more limited lending capacity than reflected in the current credit facility or may not have the ability to participate in a new credit facility 
we may see a significant change in lender participation or credit availability as a result 
capital expenditures were million at december   compared to million at december  the capital expenditures included increased leasehold improvements related to the relocation of our corporate office 
we invested million million in cash and million in seller notes on acquisitions in  of which of the acquisitions were completed within the community services segment 
we invested million million in cash and million in seller notes on acquisitions in  of which million related to domestic operations in our community services group and million related to international businesses  which we have included in our all other category for segment purposes 
we invested million million in cash and million in seller notes in  of which the acquisition of workforce services was million and all other acquisitions totaled million 
our financing activities for included net borrowings of million on the revolver with payments of million on our credit facility 
option exercise activity resulted in million in proceeds and million in tax benefits 
our financing activities during included net borrowings of million on the revolver and million in proceeds from sale and leaseback transactions 
these inflows were offset by payments of debt of million and million in debt issuance costs associated with the november amendment of our credit facility 
option exercise activity resulted in million in proceeds and million in tax benefits 
our financing activities during included net borrowings of million on the revolver and million in proceeds from sale and leaseback transactions 
these inflows were offset by payments of debt of million and million in debt issuance costs associated with the june amendment of our credit facility 
option exercise activity resulted in million in proceeds and million in tax benefits 
the amendment to our senior secured revolving credit facility increased our borrowing capacity by million to a total of million 
additional capacity of million remains in place  subject to certain limitations in our million senior notes due  which allows us to expand our total borrowing capacity to million 
the credit facility expires on october  and will be used primarily for working capital purposes  letters of credit required under our insurance programs and for acquisitions 
the credit facility is secured by a lien on all of our assets and  through secured guarantees  on all of our domestic subsidiaries assets 
as of december   we had million available under the revolver which had an outstanding balance of million 
outstanding balances bear interest at over the london interbank offered rate libor or other bank developed rates at our option 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate was 
as of december   we had irrevocable standby letters of credit in the principal amount of million issued primarily in connection with our insurance programs 
letters of credit had a borrowing rate of as of december  the commitment fee on the unused balance is 
the margin over libor and the commitment fee are determined quarterly based on our leverage ratio  as defined by the revolving credit facility 
the credit facility contains various financial covenants relating to net worth  capital expenditures and rentals and requires us to maintain specified ratios with respect to our interest and leverage 
we are in compliance with our debt covenants as of december  although the million legal charge recorded in negatively impacted the calculation of certain bank covenants  we believe we will continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants over the next twelve months 
our ability to achieve the thresholds provided for in the financial covenants largely depends upon the maintenance of continued profitability and or reductions of amounts borrowed under the facility  and continued cash collections 

table of contents operating funding sources for were approximately through medicaid reimbursement  from the dol and from other payors 
we believe our sources of funds through operations and available through the credit facility described above will be sufficient to meet our working capital  planned capital expenditure and scheduled debt repayment requirements for the next twelve months 
contractual obligations and commitments information concerning our contractual obligations and commercial commitments follows in thousands payments due by period twelve months ending december contractual obligations total and thereafter long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases fixed interest payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations total contractual obligations excludes any interest payments on our variable rate debt 
this amount excludes million of unrecognized tax benefits under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of these cash flows 
other commercial commitments total amounts committed amount of commitments expiring per period twelve months ending december and thereafter standby letters of credit surety bonds we had no significant off balance sheet transactions or interests in new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments and positions represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rates while we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of any outstanding variable rate debt  we do not currently utilize any derivative financial instruments related to our interest rate or foreign currency exposures 
our senior secured credit facility  which has an interest rate based on margins over libor or prime  tiered based upon leverage calculations  had an outstanding balance of million as of december  and million as of december  a basis point movement in the interest rate would result in an approximate million annualized effect on interest expense and cash flows 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk revenues  operating expenses and other financial transactions with our international operations are denominated in their respective functional currencies 
as a result  our results of operations and certain receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates between the local currencies and the us dollar 
the primary currencies to which we are exposed include the canadian dollar  the british pound sterling and the euro 
we do not currently hedge against foreign currency rate fluctuations 
gains and losses from such fluctuations have not been material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
international net assets are an immaterial portion of our consolidated net assets
