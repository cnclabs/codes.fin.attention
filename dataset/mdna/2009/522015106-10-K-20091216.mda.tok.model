item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
e learning and blended learning 
management and it training are primarily delivered by classroom instructors  video  and technology based training  including internet based e learning and printed means 
based upon extensive research and use of pilot programs as well as our experience  we believe that instructor led training will continue to fill the largest portion of the market because it provides the greatest foundation and ability for participants to learn  practice and receive feedback on their mastery of new knowledge and skills 
course participants value the personalized interaction and problem solving with their instructor and fellow participants  and the opportunity to get expert advice on the application of the course material to their own projects 
furthermore  instructor led classroom training insulates course participants from workplace interruptions and accelerates their learning of new technologies 
however  the use of technology based it training formats  such as internet based e learning  appears to have gained some acceptance in the it and management training and education market 
as noted last year  we have continued to investigate alternate  technology based training formats and how they might effectively be integrated into our training programs 
based on extensive testing of alternate delivery formats and training program structures  we developed learning tree anyware  our proprietary e learning platform that integrates participants in remote locations into live class events in another location 
remote attendees use an ordinary internet connection to connect to our patent pending classroom interface 
once logged in  remote anyware class participants see and hear their instructor and classmates in real time  and view the instructor s annotations on the two in class magnalearn projection screens in real time 
they are able to participate in discussions  ask questions  work in breakout sessions  and complete the same hands on exercises as their in class counterparts 
they gain the full benefit of our proprietary courseware  and achieve the same level of knowledge and skill transfer as in class participants 
early customer feedback is that anyware is highly differentiated and significantly more effective in promoting job related learning than other forms of e learning 
through anyware  we effectively apply technology to leverage the strengths of our classroom offerings 

table of contents employees our executive officers have extensive experience in the training and education industry with an average of nearly years of experience with us and nearly years of relevant industry experience 
on october   we had a total of full time equivalent employees  of whom were employed outside the united states 
we also utilized the services of expert instructors to teach our courses on an as needed basis 
we consider our relations with our employees and our instructors to be good 
intellectual property rights our course development process and course titles are proprietary  and we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  customer licensing agreements  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect those proprietary rights

our copyrighted course materials are a significant differentiator of our services from those of our competitors 
our magnalearn instructional enhancement system is covered by various united states and international patents 
magnalearn gives learning tree instructors greater flexibility to customize and pace course presentations by allowing them to annotate  highlight and manipulate course materials on two independent projection screens  in real time 
the system also provides automated feedback to our course development resources  allowing constant improvement of courses and the ability to consistently update courses immediately on a world wide basis

we cannot be certain that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar course titles or delivery methods 
if substantial unauthorized use of our products were to occur  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
we may also have to defend against claims that our current or future courses infringe on the proprietary rights of others 
defending and prosecuting these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
regulatory environment we are paid directly by the employers of learning tree course participants and do not receive funding from any government student aid or loan programs 
as a result  we do not depend on government appropriations for programs and are generally exempt from the governmental regulation of public education providers 
in contrast  providers of education to the public must comply with many laws and regulations of federal  state and international governments

risk factors you should carefully consider the following discussion of various risks and uncertainties  keeping in mind that they are not the only ones that affect us 
additional risks that we do not presently consider material  or of which we are not currently aware  may also have an adverse impact on us 
common stock price fluctuations historically  our common stock price has fluctuated  and we expect fluctuations to continue in the future 
general factors 
we believe some of the reasons for past fluctuations in the price of our stock related to factors such as announcements of developments related to our business  announcements concerning new products or enhancements by us or our competitors  developments in our relationships with our customers  market perceptions of new means of delivering training  such as the internet  variations in our revenues  gross margins  earnings or other financial results  fluctuations in general conditions in the economy  our market  and the markets served by our customers  and introductions of new technologies both by our customers and technology vendors 
in addition  prices in the stock market  particularly for technology related stocks  have been volatile in recent years 
in some cases  the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
as a result  the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance 
future sales of our common stock 
sales of our common stock by our founders  officers  directors and employees could adversely and unpredictably affect the price of shares of our common stock 
additionally  the price could be affected even by the potential for sales by these persons 
in addition to the  shares outstanding as of december   as of that date we are authorized to issue up to a total of  shares of common stock under our existing stock option and equity incentive plan 
we cannot predict the effect that any future sales of our common stock  or the potential for those sales  will have on our share price 

table of contents fluctuations in operating results historically  our operating results have fluctuated  and we expect fluctuations to continue in the future 
fluctuations in our historical operating results have resulted from many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
in the future  these or other factors could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cause our stock price to decrease 
for example timing of course development  and sales and marketing expenditures 
we try to adjust our expenditures for course development and sales and marketing to maintain our long term profitability  including our assessment of the potential to influence future customer demand  market conditions  and other factors 
this may mean accepting reduced margins in poor economic periods  as we must commit to much of our spending before our attendees enroll in our courses 
if revenues fall short of our expectations  we may not be able to adjust our expenditures quickly enough to compensate for lower than anticipated revenues 
this could compound the impact of any revenue shortfall and further affect our operating results and the price of our common stock 
course scheduling and marketing activities 
the timing and content of our courses and our marketing activities can affect the number of participants who attend our courses 
some of the activities that can contribute to fluctuations in our operating results include the frequency of our course events  the number of weeks during which our courses can be conducted in a quarter  the timing  timely delivery  frequency and size of  and the response to  our direct mail marketing and advertising campaigns  the timing of introduction of new course titles  the average length of courses  based on the current mix of course titles  which affects the average revenue per attendee  and the mix between course events held at customer locations and course events held in our education centers and hotels due to differing gross profit margins 
seasonal factors 
our quarterly revenues and income fluctuate due to the seasonal spending patterns of our customers  which are affected by factors such as cyclic or one time budgetary considerations  factors specific to their business or industry  and weather  holiday and vacation considerations 
use of accounting estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions in calculating our financial results 
as one example  we currently offer our customers a multiple course sales discount referred to as a training passport  which allows an individual passport holder to attend up to a specified number of learning tree courses over a one to two year period for a fixed price 
for a training passport  the amount of revenue we recognize for each attendance in one of our courses is based upon the selling price of the training passport  the list price of the course taken  the average list price of all courses taken  and our estimate of the average number of courses a passport holder will actually attend 
after expiration of a training passport  we record the difference  if any  between the revenue previously recognized and the training passport selling price 
for example  if a passport holder attends more courses than we had estimated  we would make a negative adjustment to revenues at the expiration of that passport 
we base our estimate of the average number of course events that a training passport holder will attend on historical trends 
however  these historical trends may not accurately predict the actual number of course events that a training passport holder will attend in the future 
if average training passport attendance rates were to increase  for example  we would have to make negative adjustments to 
table of contents our revenue  which could be significant 
for a summary of some of our key accounting estimates  please see our critical accounting estimates and policies in management s discussion and analysis 
changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure can result in uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs incurred with ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
as a result  our efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  our reputation may be harmed 
introductions and adoption of new technology 
our customers tend to increase their training at times when new technology is being introduced 
during periods when fewer new technologies are being introduced  demand for our training courses may decrease  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
other factors 
other factors that may affect our operating results include competitive forces within our current and anticipated future markets  our ability to attract customers and meet their expectations  currency fluctuations and other risks inherent in international operations  general economic conditions  differences in the timing of our spending on the marketing of our courses  as well as the timing of our spending on the development of our courses and other areas  and excess capacity and or unused space in our education centers and or administrative office facilities  and our ability to sublease or find other uses for it 
all or any of these and similar factors could cause our operating results to differ substantially from the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which would likely have a material adverse impact on our stock price 
risks associated with technology changes if we do not adequately anticipate or respond to changes in technology  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
changes in technology can affect our business in at least two principal ways 
first  we must anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new hardware  software and other information technologies and develop courses that effectively train customers in the technologies they use now and will use in the future 
second  we must adapt to changes in the technologies by which we can deliver training to our customers employees 
as a result of technology developments  we may have to make substantial and unanticipated expenditures to develop new course titles  buy new equipment  or invest in further course development software and processes to deliver our courses 
further  we may not adequately anticipate or respond successfully to technology changes for many reasons  including misjudging the impact of technology changes  as well as financial  technological or other constraints 
a lack of adequate response on our part to changes in information technology platforms  customer preferences or software technology could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price 

table of contents competition if our customers decide that they prefer training offered by new or existing competitors  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
the it and management training markets are highly fragmented  with low barriers to entry 
no single competitor holds a dominant market share 
we face intense competition from both established entities and new entries in the market 
our primary competitors include internal training departments within our current and potential customers  computer hardware and software vendors and their authorized training and education center partners  independent education and training companies  academic providers  and software systems integrators 
some of our competitors offer course titles and programs similar to ours at lower prices 
in addition  some competitors have greater financial and other resources than us 
additionally  hardware and software vendors  as well as software systems integrators  may combine it education and training with sales of their products or other services  which could allow them to offer training at lower prices than we do 
furthermore  future consolidation of it vendors or training companies could have a material impact on our future operations 
the risk of outsourcing of corporate it administration and software development overseas to countries or firms not currently served by us could have a material adverse impact on our future operations 
although instructor led classroom training continues to dominate the worldwide it and management training markets  technology based education and training formats  such as internet based distance learning  have gained some acceptance 
accordingly  our future results may also depend on the extent to which the market will continue to accept instructor led it and management training and on our ability to develop and market instructor led courses that compete effectively against technology based courses offered by our competitors 
risks associated with international operations approximately half of our annual revenue is generated by courses conducted outside the united states 
therefore  if we do not adequately anticipate and respond to the risks inherent in international operations  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
foreign currency fluctuations 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in us dollars  while the operations of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in their respective local currencies 
consequently  changes in exchange rates can unpredictably and adversely affect our consolidated operating results and could result in exchange losses 
we do not hedge against the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates 
even if we were to use hedging techniques in the future  we might not be able to eliminate or reduce the effects of currency fluctuations 
thus  exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price 
other risks associated with international operations 
additionally  our results of operations may be adversely affected by other international risks  such as difficulties in translating our courses into foreign languages  international political and economic conditions  changes in government regulation in various countries  trade barriers  difficulty in staffing our foreign offices  and in training and retaining foreign instructors  
table of contents adverse income tax and transfer pricing consequences  and potential costs associated with expansion into new territories 
we expect that international revenues will continue to be a significant portion of our total revenues 
a lack of anticipation and response to the risks associated with international operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
dependence on key personnel if we are unable to recruit and retain qualified personnel  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
our success depends in large part on the continued services of our executive officers  our senior managers and other key personnel 
the loss of these people  especially without advance notice  could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
it is also very important that we attract and retain highly skilled personnel  including course instructors  to accommodate growth  new course titles and to replace personnel who leave 
competition for qualified personnel can be intense  especially in information technology industries and or in certain geographic areas  and there are a limited number of people with the requisite knowledge and experience 
under these conditions  we could be unable to recruit  train and retain instructors and employees 
if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel  it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price 
risks associated with intellectual property if substantial unauthorized use of our courses occurs or if we must defend against infringement claims  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and confidential information 
our course development process and course titles are proprietary and we rely primarily on a combination of statutory and common law copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  customer licensing agreements  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect those proprietary rights 
our course materials generally do not include any mechanisms to prohibit or prevent unauthorized use 
as a result  someone could copy or otherwise obtain and use our course materials without authorization  either for educational use or to develop competing courses 
in addition  we operate in countries that do not provide protection of proprietary rights to the same extent as the united states 
finally  our intellectual property rights will not prevent competitors from independently developing similar course titles or delivery methods 
if substantial unauthorized use of our products were to occur  our results of operations and price of our common stock could be materially adversely impacted 
we may also have to defend against claims that our current or future courses infringe on the proprietary rights of others 
if such a claim succeeded  we might have to change or eliminate courses  and could be required to pay damages or royalties 
in addition  litigation over intellectual property rights  whether brought by us or by someone else  could be time consuming and expensive  even if we were ultimately to succeed 
accordingly  defending and prosecuting these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
risks associated with laws and regulations laws and regulations can affect our operations and may limit our ability to operate in certain states 
providers of educational programs to the public must comply with many laws and regulations of federal  state and international governments 
generally  we are exempt from this type of regulation because we contract with the employer of the participants in our courses  and we do not participate in any federal or state student aid 
table of contents or loan programs 
however  state laws and regulations targeting educational providers could affect our operations in the future and could limit our ability to obtain authorization to operate in certain states 
if we were found in violation of a state s current or future licensing or regulatory requirements  we could be subject to civil or criminal sanctions  including monetary penalties  and we could also be barred from providing educational services in that state 
in addition  laws and regulatory decisions in many areas other than education could also adversely affect our operations 
complying with current or future legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
we are subject to tax audits by state  federal and foreign jurisdictions 
such audits are to be expected and may result in adjustments as a result of the accretion of tax jurisdiction interpretations and changes in operational practices 
any such audits may result in additional taxes being assessed or in the refund of taxes previously paid 
such changes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
control by management senior personnel  especially our founders  own a majority of our outstanding shares and may therefore have significant influence over our policies and affairs and may be in a position to determine the outcome of corporate actions 
as of december   our executive officers and directors collectively beneficially own approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
as of that date  mr 
garen  our chairman of the board of directors  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
dr 
collins  our vice chairman of the board of directors  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock as of december  consequently  senior personnel  and mr 
garen and dr 
collins in particular  have significant influence over  and may control  our policies and affairs and may be in a position to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
these may include  for example  the election of directors  the adoption of amendments to our corporate documents and the approval of mergers and sales of our assets 
risks associated with possible acquisitions and other strategic transactions if we cannot successfully implement any future acquisitions or other strategic transactions  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
on occasion  we evaluate business opportunities and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy 
we could decide to pursue one or more of these opportunities by acquisition or internal development 
acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve many risks  including the difficulty of integrating acquired technologies  operations and personnel with our existing operations  the difficulty of developing and marketing new products and services  the diversion of our management s attention as a result of evaluating  negotiating and integrating acquisitions or new business ventures  our exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies  and the loss of key employees of an acquired operation 
in addition  an acquisition or other strategic transactions could adversely impact cash flows and or operating results  and dilute shareholder interests  for many reasons  including charges to our income to reflect the amortization of acquired intangible assets  write offs for the impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets  
table of contents interest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred in connection with an acquisition or new business venture  and any issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition or other strategic transactions that dilutes or lessens the rights of our current common stockholders 
we have had no significant experience in executing and implementing acquisitions 
although we have implemented other strategic transactions  those ventures have not always been successful  and we may not succeed in the future 
the risks associated with acquisitions and other strategic transactions could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price 
risks associated with changing economic conditions general domestic and international economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and common stock price 
as a result of the current economic downturn and macro economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the united states and other parts of the world  some of our customers may choose to delay or postpone purchases of courses from us until the economy and their businesses strengthen 
domestic and or international economic downturns 
a significant part of our revenues comes from fortune level companies  their international equivalents  and government organizations 
during weak economic conditions  our growth rate generally slows  and in downturns as severe as that of the past year  sales diminish 
if the domestic and or international economy were to continue to weaken  the demand for our services could decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
industry specific slowdowns 
our customers generally operate in the finance  computer  communications  electronics  systems integration  aerospace  government and military  manufacturing  and energy sectors 
if one or more of these industries experiences a slowdown  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
globalization issues 
our operations are concentrated in europe and north america  which have traditionally been the centers of it development and implementation 
in recent years  there has been increasing it activity in other parts of the world  such as china and india 
if this trend adversely affects it jobs in regions in which we have our principal operations  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
anti takeover provisions certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could adversely impact the interests of our stockholders 
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could  together or separately  discourage  delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us  even if doing so might benefit our stockholders 
these provisions may also affect the price investors would receive for their shares of our common stock 
some examples of these provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws are the division of our board of directors into three classes  the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with rights and privileges that are senior to the common stock  without prior stockholder approval  certain limitations of the rights of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders  and the prohibition of stockholder actions by written consent 

table of contents natural disasters  external strikes  acts of war or terrorism and other external events since our founding in  various natural disasters  external labor disruptions  acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external factors have from time to time impaired our ability to conduct our business  resulted in the loss of revenue or otherwise affected our operating results 
when these or other external events occur in the future  they could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
natural disasters 
natural disasters can affect our business 
for example  severe weather has at times prevented our course participants from traveling to our courses 
in these situations  we try to transfer the course participants to later courses  but we may still lose some potential revenue 
similarly  both weather and floods have also disrupted the printing and transportation of the catalogs we use in our direct mail campaigns 
the resulting delays in our mailings may reduce or delay the revenue we realize from courses listed in those catalogs 
external strikes 
we have had to react to postal  transportation  and other strikes in the countries where we operate 
postal strikes delay or reduce the delivery of our direct mail marketing materials  which may result in reduced enrollments in upcoming course events 
transportation strikes can make it difficult for our course participants or our instructors to reach course facilities 
although we try to employ strategies to mitigate the impact of external strikes  these alternative means are rarely completely effective and generally increase our costs  which could adversely affect our operating results 
acts of war or terrorism 
threats or acts of war or terrorism can adversely affect our business 
the terrorist attacks in the united states on september   the declaration of war by the united states against terrorism  and continuing hostilities in the middle east have created significant instability and uncertainty in the world 
these and future events may have a material adverse effect on world financial markets  including financial markets in the united states 
in addition  threats or acts of war or terrorism can cause course participants to be reluctant regarding or prevented from traveling to our course facilities  thereby resulting in lower attendance rates 
additionally  our direct mail marketing materials may be delayed or disrupted from reaching our customers  and suppliers and service providers may be unable to provide required services or materials 
these impacts could happen after we have committed to all the costs of our course  so that we would be unable to quickly adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues caused by these events  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and stock price 
other external factors 
other factors outside our control can affect our operations  including those related to our suppliers and service providers 
for example  disruptions of telephone networks can prevent customers from enrolling in our courses  disruptions in transportation services can prevent customers from reaching our facilities  and power outages can prevent us from delivering courses 
similarly  if commodities for example  the paper used in the printing of our catalogs that we or our customers need become scarce or more expensive  our operating results may be adversely affected

beginning in  we sold training passports and vouchers to the united states government under terms similar to those sold to our commercial customers 
we have previously disclosed the existence of a claim by the us government relating to the expiration and prepayment terms of our passport and voucher programs for periods prior to fiscal year the government has asserted that the expiration and prepayment terms of those programs in prior years violated the terms of our gsa contract  and that our acceptance of payment under these terms violates the civil false claims act  usc we do not agree  but in continuing discussions with the government have offered to settle the dispute by making a cash payment to the government 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we accrued million for the estimated cost of such a settlement 
although the positions of the parties are close  there can be no assurance that agreement on a settlement of the matter will be reached  and the ultimate payment could be more or less than the amount reserved 
in particular  in the event that the government were to file suit on this matter  under certain legal theories the government could seek an award of up to treble damages and other penalties

overview nature of the business 
learning tree international is a leading worldwide vendor independent provider of training and education to business and government organizations for their managers and it professionals 
since our founding in  we have provided high quality training to nearly million managers and it professionals 
in fiscal year we trained  course participants from more than  organizations worldwide  including large national and multinational companies  government organizations  and small and medium size companies 
as of october   we offered a broad proprietary library of intensive instructor led courses from two to five days in length  consisting of different course titles representing  hours of training  including it course titles and management course titles 
learning tree courses provide both breadth and depth of education and training across a wide range of technical and management disciplines  including operating systems  databases  computer networks  computer and network security  web development  programming languages  software engineering  open source applications  project management  business skills  leadership and professional development 
we market and present our courses through local operations in the united states  the united kingdom  france  canada  sweden and japan  and generate approximately half of our revenues internationally 
each operating subsidiary is staffed by local personnel responsible for the sale and delivery of learning tree courses in that country 
our infrastructure and logistical capabilities allow us to coordinate  plan and deliver our courses at our own education centers  external hotel and conference facilities and customer sites worldwide 
during fiscal year  we presented courses in countries 
we use a well defined systematic approach to develop and update the learning tree course library so as to provide training that is immediately relevant to course participants working in a broad range of applications and industries 
after assessing market need  courses are translated into french  swedish and japanese 
our proprietary course development process also allows us to customize our courses for delivery at our customers sites 
we design our own vendor independent it courses to provide participants an unbiased perspective regarding software and hardware products and the ability to compare and integrate multiple platforms and technologies from various vendors 
all learning tree courses are highly interactive  and incorporate extensive hands on exercises or case study workshops 
while addressing core concepts and theory  all of our technical and management courses focus primarily on providing skills  tools  and technologies that participants can apply immediately upon returning to their jobs 
to accomplish this objective  many of our realityplus management courses utilize extensive multi media simulations to teach practical management techniques 
this innovative methodology provides an environment in which realityplus course participants learn entirely by doing 
throughout these courses  they gain extensive experience applying new management skills in life like  challenging situations  within the confines of the classroom and under the guidance of an expert instructor 
as a result  realityplus course participants can achieve greater mastery of effective management techniques as well as the confidence needed to apply them  and thus return to their jobs both ready and willing to immediately apply their expanded skills in their workplaces 
we had instructors as of october   who are practicing professionals with expert subject knowledge  and who average over years of hands on  real world experience 
learning tree instructors teach 
table of contents an average of approximately course events per year on an as needed basis 
during the rest of the year they apply the skills that they teach  either as full time employees for other companies or as independent consultants 
when they are not teaching  learning tree instructors are using and honing their management and it skills as either full time employees for other companies or as independent consultants 
we offer our proprietary courses through wholly owned local subsidiaries in the united states  the united kingdom  france  canada  sweden and japan  and generate approximately half of our revenues internationally 
each operating subsidiary is staffed by local personnel responsible for the sale and delivery of our courses in that country 
additionally  our learning tree anyware e learning platform enables individuals located anywhere in the world to remotely attend our live instructor led classes held in these locations  via the internet 
we have structured our business so that the majority of our course delivery costs are variable and depend primarily upon the number of course events conducted 
we schedule our course events throughout the year based on our assessment of demand 
since learning tree instructors typically work full time or as consultants for other business and industry employers  or in the case of management instructors as industry consultants and facilitators  they teach our course events as needed and thus  our instructor related costs are largely variable 
however  expenses associated with our own education centers and course equipment are largely fixed 
we adjust our expenditures for sales and marketing depending on our strategic objectives  which generally include an assessment of our expectations for influencing future customer demand  market conditions and other factors 
however  if our expectations regarding the results of our marketing efforts prove to be wrong  any significant revenue shortfall would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in late fiscal year  we implemented a series of growth initiatives which we continued throughout fiscal year as a result of the external economic environment  during fiscal year we refocused our goals toward reducing costs and maintaining profitability 
we substantially scaled back our growth plans  but maintained some efforts in two key areas which we believe made some contribution to our fiscal year results and will provide increasing contributions in subsequent years 
these areas are increasing the size of our course library 
we believe that increasing the size of our course library will allow us to serve more customers by meeting a broader set of professional development needs 
performance of new titles has a well established historical track record  and new titles typically grow to full revenue contribution levels approximately two years after their introduction 
in fiscal year we significantly increased the rate at which we introduce new titles  so that we released new course titles in fiscal year and new course titles in fiscal year  compared to an average of new titles in fiscal years and by the end of fiscal year  we had somewhat slowed the rate of developing new titles  but we will continue to evaluate changing technology  market demand and customer requirements as we develop and introduce new titles in the future 
expanding our course delivery capability through e learning 
we remain firmly committed to the value of instructor led classroom training as the center point of our business model  and believe there is a substantial opportunity to further increase the value of that training format by leveraging technology 
in fiscal year  we began focused research in the area of blended learning  and we experimented with a variety of approaches to using technology in conjunction with our instructor led classroom training 
as a result of this research  we determined that our customers responded most positively to an approach which we refined and introduced in fiscal year as our patent pending e learning platform  learning tree anyware 
anyware allows individuals located anywhere to attend a live instructor led class being conducted in a learning tree education center or at a customer location 
we are currently marketing more than course titles available through our anyware platform in north america and europe  and we anticipate expanding that number further in fiscal year we have received positive feedback from our customers based on our initial efforts  and believe that we can expand both our geographic reach and our market share through the continued implementation of anyware 

table of contents as we have for the past years  we continue to emphasize excellence in educating and training managers and it professionals from government and commercial organizations around the world 
we believe that quality is a significant differentiator in the eyes of our customers  and that our proven long term record of exceptional performance is a reason for our clients tremendous loyalty 
it is worth noting that all of our top customers from five years ago in our fiscal year were still our customers five years later in fiscal year we continue our emphasis on excellence by focusing on our core strengths our expert instructors  proprietary content library  state of the art classrooms  application of technology to education  and worldwide course delivery systems 
in fiscal year  course participants rated learning tree instructors and courses at the highest levels in our history 
converting our course evaluation scale to a typical grading scale with a maximum possible score of  our instructors received an average grade of from their participants in fiscal year our customers have continued to respond positively to our increase in the breadth and depth of our management course offerings 
at october   we offered titles in our management curriculum representing of our entire course library  compared to titles  which represented of our course library  at the end of fiscal year the current economic climate has had an effect on our business  and although there are reports of economic stability or even growth in some of the countries where we operate many economists are still predicting a long  challenging period for the global economy 
we believe that effective training in information technology and management skills improves our customers competitiveness  and many of our customers will continue to invest in training their personnel in these critical competencies 
however  we also expect that some customers will continue to restrict their spending on training services as part of their response to the current economic conditions 
we therefore believe we must manage our business with the expectation that these conditions may continue to adversely affect our revenues  an impact that will only be partially offset by the positive effects of the growth initiatives we instituted last year 
however  there is no guarantee that these approaches will be successful 
we follow a or week fiscal year 
our year end and quarter end dates are on the friday nearest the end of the calendar quarter 
accordingly  our fiscal year ended on september   our fiscal year ended on october   and our fiscal year ended on october  our fiscal years and consisted of weeks  and our fiscal year was a week fiscal year 
results of operations the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated expressed as percentages of revenues fiscal year ended september  october  october  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses course development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income 
table of contents fiscal year compared with fiscal year our fiscal year began october   and from the outset was significantly impacted by the global financial crisis and subsequent economic downturn 
in fiscal year  our revenues decreased by to million compared to million in fiscal year income from operations decreased by to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year net income for fiscal year decreased by to million compared to million in fiscal year revenues 
our fiscal year revenues decreased by compared to fiscal year the decrease in revenues is primarily due to a decrease in the number of participants in our courses  and a decrease in average revenue per participant 
the decrease in revenue per participant was primarily the result of a negative effect of changes in foreign exchange rates  and the fact that in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  we had a higher percentage of participants at courses held at customer locations  where the average revenue per participant is lower than for courses held in our own education centers  as well as a higher percentage of participants at our management courses  which have a shorter average length than our it courses and accordingly a lower average revenue per participant 
these decreases were partially offset by price increases 
during fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of training  a decrease of from the  attendee days in fiscal year in our management courses in fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of training  a decrease over the  attendee days in fiscal year in our it courses during fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of it training  a decrease from the  attendee days in fiscal year because of our week accounting convention  our fiscal year had weeks  while our fiscal year had weeks 
revenues in the united states decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  primarily due to a decrease in the number of course participants 
revenues from our international operations decreased from million in fiscal year to million fiscal year  primarily due to a decrease in the number of course participants and to a negative effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues primarily includes the costs of course instructors and their travel expenses  course materials and equipment  freight  classroom facilities and refreshments 
during fiscal year  we presented  events compared to  events during fiscal year our cost of revenues for fiscal year was million compared to million in fiscal year our cost of revenues as a percentage of our revenues increased to for fiscal year from in fiscal year changes in exchange rates do not materially affect our gross profit percentages since exchange rates have essentially the same impact on both revenues and cost of revenues in any time period 
the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year reflects a decrease in average revenue per event partly offset by a decrease in average cost per event 
the decrease in our average revenue per event  is the result of a effect of changes in foreign exchange rates  and a decrease in average participants per event and the decrease in average revenue per participant discussed earlier 
the decrease in average cost per event principally results from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates and the decrease in our average number of days per event held compared to fiscal year  somewhat offset by proportionately higher fixed costs per event due to having fewer events during fiscal year over which to allocate the expenses associated with our education centers 
gross profit in the united states decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  primarily due to a decrease in the number of course participants 
gross profit from our international operations decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  primarily due to a decrease in the number of course participants and a negative effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 

table of contents course development expenses 
we maintain a disciplined process to develop new courses and update our existing courses 
all costs incurred in that process  principally for internal product development staff and for subject matter experts  are expensed when incurred and are included in course development expenses 
in fiscal year  we began a strategic initiative aimed at significantly increasing the rate at which we develop new course titles  and we began introducing new titles at an accelerated rate in the third quarter of that year 
in fiscal year  we introduced new course titles  compared with new course titles introduced in fiscal year we expect to introduce fewer course titles in fiscal year than in fiscal year during fiscal year  largely due to the decline in our revenues  course development expenses were of revenues compared to during fiscal year in fiscal year  we decreased our overall spending on course development by to million compared with million in fiscal year this decrease reflects both the reduction in costs associated with the development of new titles in fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year as well as cost savings in the development process 
our development costs for a course are incurred well before the date the course is first taught 
we introduced new management course titles in fiscal year compared with nine in fiscal year during each of fiscal years and we introduced new it courses 
during this period  we have continued to research and develop various approaches to delivering hybrid learning  which combines instructor led classroom training with web based e learning  culminating with the introduction of learning tree anyware  our e learning platform that allows individuals located anywhere to attend a live instructor led class being conducted in a learning tree education center or at a customer location 
at the end of fiscal year  the learning tree library of instructor led courses numbered titles  comprising over  hours of training  compared with titles at the end of fiscal year the increase in the number of titles in fiscal year reflects the net effect of introducing new titles and retiring titles 
in general  titles are retired when the profits they generate no longer justify the ongoing cost of marketing them and maintaining their content 
thus  we may or may not develop more titles than we retire in any period 
at october   we had management titles in our course library  compared with management titles at the end of fiscal year our library of it titles numbered as of october  compared to titles at the end of fiscal year sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses primarily include the cost of designing  producing and distributing direct mail and media advertisements  marketing e mails and our website  compensation and travel related costs for sales and marketing personnel  and the cost of information systems to support these activities 
our sales and marketing expense  and in particular our expenditure on course catalogs  is one of our largest expenditures 
we have adjusted the market segments to which we mail our catalogs  and are presently evaluating a number of additional ways to increase the efficiency of our marketing expenditures by spending less without materially affecting the response to that marketing 
at the same time  in response to changing economic conditions  we have decreased our sales staff in our operating units 
our sales and marketing expenses were and of revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in sales and marketing expenses compared to fiscal year included million in costs associated with printing and mailing our catalogs  million in personnel related expenses  million in professional service fees  million in trade show and advertising expense  and million for decreases in travel and living  general office expenditures and other items 
changes in foreign exchange rates caused our overall sales and marketing expenses to decline by about 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses in fiscal year decreased by million over the prior fiscal year  from million in fiscal year to million 
we have previously disclosed the existence of a claim by the us government relating to the expiration and prepayment terms of our passport and voucher programs for periods prior to fiscal year while we continue to believe that we have complied with the terms of our contracts  we have offered to settle the dispute by making 
table of contents a cash payment to the government  and accordingly we recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to reflect the anticipated cost of such a settlement 
this resulted in a million increase to our g a expense 
although our respective positions are close on this matter  there can be no assurance that agreement on a settlement will be reached  and the ultimate payment could be more or less than the amount reserved 
offsetting this increase to g a expense  are the decreases related to million in payroll and benefits  million in incentive and stock compensation  million in professional service fees  and million in facilities and other net decreases 
additionally  fiscal years and included the following significant items not associated with current operations fiscal year included million of restructuring costs associated with reconfiguring our business to meet the challenges of the current business environment and million for costs associated with the since discontinued effort to explore the sale of the company  primarily for non contingent transaction contribution bonuses for certain employees 
fiscal year included million for costs associated with the since discontinued effort to explore the sale of the company  primarily for non contingent transaction contribution bonuses for certain employees  professional service fees of million for tax services and financial consulting  million related to lapsed options  million for contingency accruals and million for severance 
during fiscal year  changes in foreign exchange rates caused total general and administrative expenses to decline by about compared with the same period of fiscal year despite the reduction in our absolute expenditure on g a  the reduction in revenues resulted in g a expense of of revenues in fiscal year compared with in the prior fiscal year 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net in fiscal year decreased by million over the prior fiscal year  from million to million 
this change was primarily due to a decrease in interest income of million due to lower interest rates and lower outstanding cash balances as well as a decrease of million because in fiscal year we recorded the proceeds from the liquidation of our investment in collegis  inc income taxes 
in fiscal year  our income tax provision was million compared to million in fiscal year our effective rate for fiscal year was compared to in fiscal year the higher effective rate for fiscal year was primarily attributable to us income taxes on the dividends from foreign subsidiaries  the write off of deferred tax assets related to equity compensation and other nondeductible items  which increased tax expense by approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by the tax benefits from valuation allowance reversals of approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  several of our foreign subsidiaries paid dividends to our us parent corporation totaling approximately million 
after taking into account withholding taxes  foreign tax credits  and previously taxed income amounts  we accrued approximately million of us income taxes on the dividends from the foreign subsidiaries 
as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we reversed the valuation allowance for our foreign tax credit carryovers and for our deferred tax assets in a foreign jurisdiction 
because of changes we made to our intercompany agreements with our foreign subsidiaries and the improved financial performance of their operations  we determined that it is more likely than not that the benefits from the foreign tax credit carryovers will be realized 
we also determined that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits for the deferred tax assets in the foreign jurisdiction because of the improved financial performance of our operations in the foreign jurisdiction 
the reversal of the valuation allowances for these items resulted in a net benefit of approximately million 
we have not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes of international subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of october   because we currently intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely 
the undistributed earnings were approximately million as of october  if these earnings were distributed  we would incur approximately million of foreign withholding taxes 
because of the availability of us foreign tax credits  it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested 

table of contents fiscal year compared with fiscal year in fiscal year  our revenues increased by to million compared to million in fiscal year income from operations increased by to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year net income for fiscal year decreased by to million compared to million in fiscal year revenues 
our fiscal year revenues increased by compared to fiscal year the increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of participants in our courses  a increase in average revenue per participant and a increase due to higher classroom rental revenues than in fiscal year the increase in revenue per participant was primarily the result of a effect of changes in foreign exchange rates and  to a lesser degree  price increases 
these increases were partly offset by a higher percentage of participants at courses held at customer locations  where the average revenue per participant is lower than for courses held in our own education centers  and by a higher percentage of participants at our management courses  which have a shorter average length than our it courses and accordingly a lower average revenue per participant 
during fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of training an increase of from the  attendee days in fiscal year in our management courses in fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of training  a increase over the  attendee days in fiscal year in our it courses during fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of it training  a increase from the  attendee days in fiscal year because of our week accounting convention  our fiscal year had weeks  while fiscal year had revenues in the united states increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year revenues from our international operations increased from million in fiscal year to million fiscal year cost of revenues

the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year reflects a increase in average revenue per event partly offset by a increase in average cost per event 
the increase in our average revenue per event  excluding the effect of exchange rates  is the result of a increase in average participants per event and the increase in average revenue per participant discussed earlier 
the increase in average cost per event is due primarily to the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates and the increase in participants per event 
gross profit in the united states increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year gross profit from our international operations increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year course development expenses 
during fiscal year  course development expenses were of revenues compared to during the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal year  we increased our overall spending on course development by to million compared with million in fiscal year this increase reflects the costs associated with the development of the greater number of new titles in fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
we introduced new management course titles in each of fiscal years and during fiscal year we introduced new it courses  compared with in fiscal year 
table of contents at the end of fiscal year  our library of instructor led courses numbered titles  comprising over  hours of training  compared with titles at the end of fiscal year the increase in the number of titles in fiscal year reflects the net effect of introducing new titles and retiring titles

these increases were partially offset by a reduction of million in costs associated with printing and mailing our catalogs 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses in fiscal year increased by million over the prior fiscal year  from million to million and represented of revenues compared to in fiscal year the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to increases in professional service fees of million including amounts for tax assistance in conjunction with the implementation of fin million  financial advisory services million and additional legal fees million  and increases of million in personnel related costs including compensation and benefits million  one time charges related to employee compensation for gains on expired stock options million  increases in stock compensation expense million  and an increase in severance expense million  offset by decreases in incentive compensation million 
for fiscal year  total expenses associated with share based compensation were million  compared to million in fiscal year in fiscal year  million of share based compensation expense was recorded to general and administrative expense  compared to million in fiscal year the remainder of our share based compensation expense is apportioned among other expense categories  based on where we record the compensation costs for the individuals with whom the stock option compensation expense is associated 
included in general and administrative expenses for fiscal year was million associated with a process to explore the potential sale of the company  including employee non contingent transaction contribution bonuses million  and legal  investment banker and board fees million 
we initiated that process on may  and terminated it on october  other income expense  net 
other income expense  net in fiscal year decreased by million over the prior fiscal year  from million to million 
these changes included foreign currency exchange losses as opposed to prior year gains million and a decrease in proceeds from the liquidation in fiscal year of our investment in collegis  inc million  partly offset by a decrease in loss on disposal of assets million and reductions in interest expense million 
income taxes 
in fiscal year  our income tax provision was million compared to million in fiscal year our effective rate for fiscal year was compared to in fiscal year the low effective rate for fiscal year was attributable to the reversal of the valuation allowance related to our us deferred tax assets which reduced our tax provision by million and million from favorable adjustments from an audit of our canadian subsidiary 
as of the end of our fourth quarter of fiscal year  we reversed the valuation allowance for certain state deferred tax assets because we determined it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets were recoverable because of the improved financial performance in the relevant jurisdictions 
the reversal of the 
table of contents valuation allowance resulted in a net benefit of approximately million 
as of october   we continued to maintain valuation allowances in the us related to foreign tax credit carryovers  and we continued to maintain valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets in a foreign jurisdiction 
as of the beginning of fiscal year  we adopted the provisions of fin codified primarily in financial accounting standards board fasb asc  income taxes 
the cumulative effect of the adoption was a million reduction to retained earnings 
as of the date of adoption  the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was million  all of which would have an impact on our effective tax rate if recognized 
as of the date of adoption  we had million accrued for interest and million accrued for penalties 
we did not provide for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes of international subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of october   because such earnings were intended to be reinvested indefinitely 
the undistributed earnings were approximately million as of october  if these earnings were distributed  we would incur approximately million of foreign withholding taxes 
because of the availability of us foreign tax credits  it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested 
geographic data learning tree education centers are located in six countries and we have historically derived roughly half of our revenues from outside the united states 
the united states operations recorded revenues of million in fiscal year compared to revenues of million in fiscal year revenues from our european operations were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year canadian operations recorded revenues of million in fiscal year compared to revenues of million in fiscal year and our asian operations recorded revenues of million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on segment reporting 
although our consolidated financial statements are stated in us dollars  all of our subsidiaries other than in the us have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
gains and losses arising from the translation of the balance sheets of our subsidiaries from the functional currencies to us dollars are reported as adjustments to stockholders equity 
fluctuations in exchange rates may also have an effect on our results of operations 
since both revenues and expenses are generally denominated in the subsidiary s local currency  changes in exchange rates that have an adverse effect on our foreign revenues are partially offset by a favorable effect on our foreign expenses  and vice versa 
the impact of future exchange rates on our results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to date  we have not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates and therefore we continue to be subject to such risks 
in the future  we may undertake such hedging transactions 
there can be no assurance that any hedging techniques we implement would be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations 
inflation inflation and changing prices do not have a significant impact on our net sales  revenues and income from continuing operations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements measuring liabilities at fair value 
in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu to provide fair value measurement clarification in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available 
under the standard  appropriate valuation techniques include a technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or another 
table of contents valuation technique an income or a market approach that is consistent with the principles of accounting standards codification asc we adopted this standard in august with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting standards codification 
in june  the fasb issued asu to establish the fasb accounting standards codification included in asc as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the fasb uses asu to amend asc 
this standard was effective for interim and annual periods ending after september   and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
subsequent events 
in may  the fasb issued standards included in asc for accounting and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or available to be issued 
companies must disclose the date through which they evaluated subsequent events and whether the date corresponds with the filing of their financial statements 
it is effective for fiscal periods ending after june  this standard was effective for our third quarter ended july   and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
in april  the fasb issued standards included in asc which provide additional guidance on fair value  and reaffirm the previous definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants under current market conditions 
this standard requires an evaluation of whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability 
if there has  transactions or quoted prices may not be indicative of fair value and a significant adjustment may need to be made to those prices to estimate fair value 
additionally  an entity must consider whether the observed transaction was orderly that is  not distressed or forced 
if the transaction was orderly  the obtained price can be considered a relevant observable input for determining fair value 
if the transaction is not orderly  other valuation techniques must be used when estimating fair value 
we adopted this standard on april   with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
in april  the fasb issued standards included in asc requiring disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim and annual financial statements 
we adopted this standard on april   with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
in april  the fasb issued standards included in asc which provide additional guidance designed to create greater clarity and consistency in accounting for and presenting impairment losses on securities 
we adopted this standard on april   with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurement 
in october  the fasb issued standards included in asc which provide a common definition of fair value and establish a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable 
the standard does not require new fair value measurements but applies to other standards that require fair value measurement  expanded disclosures are also required 
in february  the fasb delayed the effective date of this standard to fiscal years beginning after november  for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we will adopt the standard for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year we do not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
in february  the fasb issued standards included in asc permitting entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the standard became effective for us october  we chose not to elect the fair value option 
other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb did not  or management believes will not  have a material impact on our present or future consolidated financial statements 
quarterly results of operations historically  our quarterly operating results have fluctuated  and that is expected to continue in the future 
typically  our first and third fiscal quarters have higher revenues and income from operations than do our second and fourth fiscal quarters 
the fluctuations may be caused by many factors such as i the frequency of course events  ii the number of weeks during which courses can be conducted in a quarter  iii the timing  timely delivery  frequency and size of and response to our direct mail marketing and advertising campaigns  iv the timing of the introduction of new course titles  v the mix between course events held at customer sites and course events held in our education centers and hotels due to differing gross profit margins  vi competitive forces within markets we serve  vii our ability to attract customers and meet their expectations  viii currency fluctuations and other risks inherent in international operations  ix natural disasters  external strikes  acts of war or terrorism and other external factors  and x general economic conditions and industry specific slowdowns 
fluctuations in quarter to quarter results also occur as a result of differences in the timing of our spending on the marketing and development of our courses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for our unaudited quarterly financial data for the eight fiscal quarters ended october  our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents on hand of million at october  during fiscal year  the total of our cash and cash equivalents decreased by million  largely as a result of the expenditure of million for repurchases of our common stock and million of purchases of fixed assets  partly offset by million of net proceeds from the sales of available for sale securities  cash provided by operations and the effects of exchange rates on our cash

table of contents cash provided by operating activities declined by million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year cash provided from investing activities improved million during fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to higher net proceeds from the disposition of available for sale securities and fewer purchases of equipment and other capital assets 
cash used in financing activities was million due to repurchases of our common stock during fiscal year the negative effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents decreased by million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  primarily reflecting the decline in exchange rates for the british pound  euro and canadian dollar as applied to our international cash balances 
cash provided by operating activities declined by million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year cash provided from investing activities improved million during fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to higher net proceeds from the disposition of available for sale securities  partially offset by more purchases of equipment and other capital assets 
the effects of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  primarily reflecting the decline in exchange rates for the british pound  euro and canadian dollar as applied to our international cash balances 
in fiscal year  we generated million of free cash flow  which we define as net cash provided by operating activities minus purchases of equipment  property and leasehold improvements 
this compares to million of free cash flow in fiscal year in fiscal year  free cash flow was million 
we believe that free cash flow is useful for investors to understand our liquidity 
free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure and accordingly should be considered only as a supplement to  and not a replacement of  cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity 
the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities computed in accordance with gaap fiscal year september  october  october  cash provided by operating activities less purchases of equipment  property and leasehold improvements free cash flow liquidity 
at october  our net working capital current assets minus current liabilities was million  a million increase from our working capital balance at october  the change in net working capital was primarily due to a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents  a decrease in deferred revenue of million  a decrease in trade accounts receivable of million  sales of current available for sale securities of million  a decrease in prepaids and other current assets of million  a decrease of million due to the after tax effects of our accrual for the prior period claim explained above  and the reclassification of million of available for sale securities from long term to current assets 
we have no outstanding debt or line of credit agreements 
we anticipate we will continue to rely primarily on our balance of cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows from operations to finance our operating cash needs 
we believe that such funds will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
at october   we had million in face value of auction rate securities ars 
this compares to million in ars at october  our ars are long term debt instruments backed by municipal bonds and student loans 
none of our ars are mortgage backed debt 
all of our ars had credit ratings of aaa or aa when purchased 
historically  our ars were highly liquid  using a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rates every  or days to provide liquidity at par 
as a result of liquidity issues in the global credit and capital markets  it has been difficult to sell ars in the open market 
however  in fiscal year  we did sell million of our ars at their stated value 
in fiscal year  we sold an additional million of our ars at their stated value 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we sold an additional million of our ars at their stated value 
we have signed a repurchase agreement with ubs under which we have 
table of contents the right to sell all of our remaining ars at their stated value at any time during the period from june  through july  we do not believe that the failure of periodic auctions affects the value of the collateral underlying our ars  and there have been no defaults on the underlying collateral 
we continue to earn and receive interest at contractually set rates in a timely manner 
we can finance our operations even if our ars investments were to be illiquid for an extended period of time 
based on a valuation performed by an independent expert  houlihan smith company  inc  we concluded there was a temporary impairment of million in the fair value of our ars as of october  this valuation is updated at the end of each quarter 
because we believe we will be able to redeem these securities at par in the foreseeable future  we do not consider the impairment to be other than temporary or to be permanent 
in november  three of our five ars were downgraded by several credit agencies from aaa or aa to a  a or baa at the end of our first quarter of fiscal year  we updated our evaluation of our ars based on the evaluation by our independent expert 
as a result  the temporary impairment of our ars increased from million to million 
at the end of our second quarter of fiscal year  based on the evaluation by our independent expert we increased the temporary impairment from million to million 
at the end of our third quarter of fiscal year  because one of our ars was called on july  for full face value of million and based on the evaluation of our remaining ars by our independent expert  we decreased the temporary impairment from million to million 
at the end of our fourth quarter of fiscal year  based on the evaluation by our independent expert  we decreased the temporary impairment on our four remaining ars from million to million 
in fiscal year  we recorded an increase on an after tax basis of million to other comprehensive income to reflect the reduction in the impairment of the ars 
because we intend to exercise our right to sell all of our remaining ars to ubs under the repurchase agreement within the next twelve months these ars are classified as current assets as of october  capital requirements 
during fiscal year  we made capital expenditures of million for the purchase of equipment worldwide  mostly computers 
we will continue to invest in our infrastructure to accommodate any increased customer demand  to continue improving the quality and effectiveness of our course delivery  and to incorporate significant changes in technology 
we have a number of operating leases for our administrative offices and education center classroom facilities located worldwide 
these leases expire at various dates over the next years 
in addition to requiring monthly payments for rent  some of the leases contain asset retirement provisions whereby we are required to return the leased facility back to a specified condition at the expiration of the lease 
the following table summarizes our contractual commitments at october  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year fiscal years fiscal and years fiscal more than years fiscal operating leases i purchase commitments other lease contractual obligations ii total i amounts exclude future minimum sublease rental proceeds of million due in the future under non cancelable subleases

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting estimates and policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following list of critical accounting estimates and policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting estimates and policies  defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and or require management s significant judgments and estimates 
critical accounting estimates revenue recognition 
we offer our customers a multiple course sales discount referred to as a learning tree training passport 
a learning tree training passport allows an individual passport holder to attend up to a specified number of courses over a one to two year period for a fixed price 
for a training passport  the amount of revenue recognized for each course attendance is based upon the selling price of the training passport  the list price of the course taken  the weighted average list price of all courses taken and the estimated average number of courses passport holders will actually attend 
upon expiration of each individual training passport  we record the difference  if any  between the revenues previously recognized and that specific training passport s selling price 
the estimated attendance rate is based upon the historical experience of the average number of course events that training passport holders have been attending 
the actual training passport attendance rate is reviewed at least semi annually  and if the training passport attendance rates change  the revenue recognition rate for active training passports and for training passports sold thereafter is adjusted prospectively 
we believe it is appropriate to recognize revenues on this basis in order to most closely match revenue and related costs  as the substantial majority of our passport holders do not attend the maximum number of course events permitted under their training passports 
we believe that the use of recent historical data is reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of the average actual number of course events attended by passport holders 
the average actual attendance rate for all expired training passports has closely approximated the estimated rate we utilize 
although we have seen no material changes in the historical rates as the number of course titles has changed  we monitor such potential effects 
in general  determining the estimated average number of course events that will be attended by a training passport holder is based on historical trends that may not continue in the future 
these estimates could differ in the near term from amounts used in arriving at the reported revenue 
if the estimates are wrong  we would record the difference between the revenues previously recognized for that training passport and the training passport selling price upon expiration of that training passport 
thus  the timing of revenue recognition may be affected by an inaccurate estimation  but the inaccuracy would have no effect on the aggregate revenue recognized over the one to two year life of each training passport 
for newer passport products for which historical utilization data is not available  we assume that the estimated average number of courses to be attended is equal to the number of courses available on the passport 
this assumed utilization rate may be revised in future periods after sufficient time has passed to amass historical trends 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
we use estimates in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  based on our analysis of various factors  including our historical collection experience  current trends  specific identification of invoices which are considered doubtful and a percentage of our past due accounts receivable 
although our estimates for this reserve have in the past been reasonably accurate  these estimates could differ from actual collection experience and are subject to adjustment 
our trade accounts receivable are written off when they are deemed uncollectible 
lease termination costs 
we lease education center and administrative office space under various operating lease agreements 
certain of these operating leases include space that is not used and which is currently subleased 
we calculate and record a liability related to those leases based on the difference between the present value of the net aggregate sublease rental income and the present value of the prime lease costs for the subleased space throughout the remaining term of the leases 
periodically  we evaluate the nature and extent of each of the individual provisions and make adjustments as appropriate  as new information becomes available or subsequent developments occur 
in  we entered into a year lease on a building in london to house our united kingdom education center 
this building has space in addition to that required for our current needs  which we attempt to sublet 
when space is vacant from time to time  we must estimate the fair value of the liability for the vacant space based upon the remaining lease costs as defined by our operating lease agreement reduced by estimated future sublease rental income that could be reasonably obtained for the property based upon prevailing real estate market conditions 
the computed long term portion of such liabilities is recorded as deferred facilities rent in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with the short term portion being recorded in other accrued liabilities 
amounts are paid under the master lease to the landlord  netted against subtenant sublease receipts  and applied to our accrued lease liability  reducing the amount of liability recorded with an offset to general and administrative expenses 
lease termination activities have historically resulted in accrued liabilities recorded in deferred facilities rent 
however  due to the timing of payments due to landlords and payments due from subtenants  certain lease terminations have resulted in assets included in other assets at october  and october  asset retirement obligations 
we record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated future cost to retire an asset 
for us  most asset retirement obligation aro liabilities are primarily associated with education facilities leasehold improvements which  at the end of a lease  we are obligated to remove in order to restore the facility back to a condition specified in the lease agreement 
at the inception of such a lease  we record the aro as a liability and also record a leasehold improvement asset in an amount equal to the fair value of the liability 
the capitalized leasehold improvement asset is then depreciated on a straight line basis over years or the term of the lease  whichever is shorter 
any difference between the actual costs incurred for the eventual retirement and the estimated liability previously recorded will be recognized as a gain or loss in our statement of operations at the termination of the lease 
the fair value of any such aro liability is estimated in three steps the costs of leasehold restoration are estimated as if they were to be performed at the inception of the lease  the cost is forecast into the future by applying an inflation rate in effect at the time of adoption together with a market risk premium for a contractor s risk for performing the work in the future  and the present value of this future cost is computed by discounting it at our credit worthiness interest rate determined at the inception of the lease 
the aro liability is subsequently increased annually by interest accretion throughout the term of the lease 
in future periods we may also make adjustments to the aro liability as a result of the availability of new information  technology changes  changes in labor costs and other factors 
the estimate of the aro liability is based on a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment 
we cannot predict what revisions to these assumptions will be required in future periods 

table of contents the aro liability is based on a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment 
these include estimates for expected future cash flows related to contractual obligations  primarily to restore leased space back to open floor layouts as required by the lease agreements  our credit adjusted risk free rate that considers our estimated credit rating as of the date of lease inception  the market risk premium that we determine based on the length of the individual leases  and the relevant inflation factor in each affected country 
for the more significant aros we obtain third party restoration estimates specific to those leases 
we cannot predict the type of revisions to these assumptions that will be required in future periods due to the availability of additional information  technology changes  the price of labor costs and other factors 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
learning tree course events range from two to five days  with an average duration of approximately four days 
we use a or week fiscal year in order to better align our external financial reporting with the way we operate our business 
under this method  each fiscal quarter ends on the friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter 
since all courses have a duration of five days or less  and all courses begin and end within the same calendar week  under the or week fiscal year method all revenues and related direct costs for each course event are recognized in the week and the fiscal quarter in which the event takes place 
we offer our customers a multiple course sales discount referred to as a learning tree training passport 
a learning tree training passport allows an individual passport holder to attend up to a specified number of courses over a one to two year period for a fixed price 
for a training passport  the amount of revenue recognized for each attendance in a course is based upon the selling price of the training passport  the list price of the course taken  the weighted average list price of all courses taken and the estimated average number of courses passport holders will actually attend 
upon expiration of each individual training passport  we record the difference  if any  between the revenues previously recognized and that specific training passport s selling price 
the estimated attendance rate is based upon the historical experience of the average number of course events that training passport holders have been attending 
the actual training passport attendance rate is reviewed at least semi annually  and if the training passport attendance rates change  the revenue recognition rate for active training passports and for training passports sold thereafter is adjusted prospectively 
we believe it is appropriate to recognize revenues on this basis in order to most closely match revenue and related costs  as the substantial majority of our passport holders do not attend the maximum number of course events permitted under their training passports 
we believe that the use of recent historical data is reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of the average actual number of course events attended by passport holders 
the average actual attendance rate for all expired training passports has closely approximated the estimated rate we utilize 
although we have seen no material changes in the historical rates as the number of course titles has changed  we monitor such potential effects 
in general  determining the estimated average number of course events that will be attended by a training passport holder is based on historical trends that may not continue in the future 
these estimates could differ in the near term from amounts used in arriving at the reported revenue 
if the estimates are wrong  we would record the difference between the revenues previously recognized for that training passport and the training passport selling price upon expiration of that training passport 
thus  the timing of revenue recognition may be affected by an inaccurate estimation  but the inaccuracy would have no effect on the aggregate revenue recognized over the one to two year life of each training passport 
for newer passport products for which historical utilization data is not available  we assume that the estimated average number of courses to be attended is equal to the number of courses available on the passport 
this assumed utilization rate may be revised in future periods after sufficient time has passed to amass historical trends 
in addition to our learning tree training passports  we also offer a multiple course sales discount referred to as learning tree training vouchers 
with learning tree training vouchers  a customer buys the right to send 
table of contents a specified number of attendees to learning tree courses over a six to twelve month period for a fixed price 
revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis for each attendance 
if a training voucher has unused seats at the time of expiration of the voucher  we record the pro rata selling price of the expired unused seat as revenue 
at times we make a business decision to extend a voucher beyond the normal month expiration date 
to provide additional flexibility to meet our customers training needs  we offer a multiple training day sales discount referred to as learning tree day passes 
with learning tree day passes  a customer buys the right to take up to days of training over a one year period for a fixed price 
revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis for each attendance day 
if a day pass has unused days at expiration  we record the pro rata value of the unused days as revenue 
stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by assumptions regarding a number of variables including our expected stock price volatility  expected term and risk free interest rates 
we analyzed our historical volatility to estimate the expected volatility 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on the us treasury rate at the date of grant  which most closely resembles the expected life of our options 
the estimated expected life represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and has been determined based on the simplified method under asc we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated pre vesting forfeitures 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
during fiscal year  we reduced to zero the estimated forfeiture rate for executive personnel 
long lived assets 
we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets  such as equipment  property and leasehold improvements  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in making such evaluations  we compare the expected future cash flows to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the total of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we are required to make estimates of the fair value of the long lived assets in order to calculate the impairment loss equal to the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets 
we make significant assumptions and estimates in this process regarding matters that are inherently uncertain  such as estimating cash flows  remaining useful lives  discount rates and growth rates 
the resulting cash flows are computed over an extended period of time  which subjects those assumptions and estimates to an even larger degree of uncertainty 
while we believe that our estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect the valuation of long lived assets 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes under the provisions of fasb asc  income taxes 
deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the basis reported in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse 
we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  codified primarily in fasb asc  income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for income 
table of contents taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  as of the beginning of fiscal year  we adopted fin the cumulative effect of the adoption was a million reduction to retained earnings 
as of the date of adoption  the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was million  all of which would have an impact on our effective tax rate if recognized 
our continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as of the date of adoption  we had million accrued for interest and million accrued for penalties 
outlook effect of exchange rates 
one of the effects of the recent economic turmoil was the sudden strengthening of the us dollar during our first and second fiscal quarters of and its subsequent weakening which has continued into our first fiscal quarter of approximately half of our business annually is conducted in currencies other than us dollars and fluctuations in exchange rates will affect future revenues and expenses when translated into dollars 
if the exchange rates of december  remain constant for the remainder of our first quarter of fiscal year  we would expect to report a favorable effect of approximately on our revenues during our first quarter of fiscal year compared to the same quarter of fiscal year we would see an unfavorable  though lesser  effect on our overall expenses 
the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates is somewhat less pronounced on operating expenses than on revenues and cost of sales  primarily since our operating expenses are more heavily dollar denominated  largely because of corporate management and our centralized it  marketing and course development activities which are located here in the united states and which support our worldwide operations 
revenues 
we currently expect revenues for our first quarter of fiscal year of between million and million  which would represent a reduction of between and from revenues of million in our first quarter of fiscal year this includes the positive effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 
first quarter gross profit 
we expect a gross profit percentage in our first quarter of fiscal year of between and compared to in our first quarter of fiscal year  largely because the fixed costs of our education centers and classroom equipment will be allocated to fewer expected events this year compared to the same quarter of our prior fiscal year  and because we expect to have somewhat fewer participants per event in our first quarter of fiscal year than in our first quarter of fiscal year first quarter operating expenses 
we expect overall operating expenses for our first quarter of fiscal year to be between million and million  a reduction of between and compared to million in the same quarter a year earlier 
first quarter income from operations 
as a result of the above factors  we expect first quarter operating income of between million and million compared with million in our first quarter of fiscal year first quarter interest income 
we expect first quarter interest income to be approximately million 
first quarter pre tax income 
overall  we expect to report pre tax income for our first quarter of fiscal year of between million and million  compared with million in the first quarter of our prior fiscal year 
effective tax rate 
we estimate that our effective tax rate in our first quarter of fiscal year will be approximately 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have 
interest rate risk 
our cash equivalents and available for sale securities are diversified and consist primarily of investment grade securities of high quality financial institutions and corporations 
the fair value of our portfolio of marketable securities would not be significantly affected by either a increase or decrease in the rates of interest due primarily to the short term nature of the portfolio 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk 
we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
the exposure to exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign subsidiaries 
subsidiaries with material foreign currency exposure are in canada  the united kingdom  sweden and france 
for our foreign subsidiaries  exchange rates can have an impact on the united states dollar value of their reported earnings as well as on the intercompany transactions with the united states and other subsidiaries 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in united states dollars  while the operations of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in their respective local currencies 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the united states dollar may have a significant impact on our reported results 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated monthly into united states dollars at the weighted average exchange rate 
consequently  as the value of the dollar strengthens or weakens relative to other currencies in our major markets the resulting translated revenues  expenses and operating profits become lower or higher  respectively 
a hypothetical appreciation of the canadian dollar  euro  british pound and swedish krona of would result in a million increase to our consolidated fiscal year results 
this was estimated using a appreciation factor to the average monthly exchange rates applied to the net income or loss for each of our subsidiaries in the respective period 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates also can have an impact on the united states dollar amount of our stockholders equity 
the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars at the exchange rate of the balance sheet for the respective reporting period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
due to unfavorable changes in the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar  the euro  the british pound and the swedish krona  the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income declined million during fiscal year additionally  we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency gains or losses due to short term intercompany transactions between the united states and its consolidated subsidiaries 
while these intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation  exchange rate changes do affect consolidated earnings 
these balances generated a foreign exchange loss of million in fiscal year to perform a sensitivity analysis  we assessed the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of a hypothetical change in the value of foreign currencies  assuming no change in interest rates 
as of october   the result of a uniform change in the values of foreign currency exchange rates against the united states dollar for intercompany exposures with all other variables held constant would be immaterial to our results of operations 
to date  we have not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates 
in the future  we may undertake such transactions  however  any hedging techniques we might implement might not be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations 
credit risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of investments in available for sale securities  restricted interest bearing long term investments and trade accounts receivable 
we have policies that limit investments to investment grade securities and the amount 
table of contents of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we do not require collateral or other security to support client receivables since most of our customers are large  well established companies and government agencies 
our credit risk is also mitigated because our customer base is diversified both by geography and industry  and no single customer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues on an annual or quarterly basis 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for any potential credit losses related to our trade receivables 
we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk in receivables denominated in foreign currencies and we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and in the liquidity and capital resources section  we held million in ars at october  due to the turmoil in the worldwide credit markets since mid february  we were not able to sell these securities in the scheduled auctions that occur every  or days 
since the end of fiscal year  we have sold million of our ars that were redeemed at their stated value pursuant to a repurchase agreement with ubs under which we have the right to sell our remaining million of ars at their stated value at any time during the period from june  through july
