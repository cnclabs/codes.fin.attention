item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a clinical stage drug development company that discovers and develops novel  small molecule drugs for the treatment of inflammatory autoimmune diseases  as well as for certain cancers and metabolic diseases 
our pioneering research focuses on intracellular signaling pathways and related targets that are critical to disease mechanisms 
our productivity has resulted in strategic collaborations 
table of contents with large pharmaceutical partners to develop and market our product candidates 
we have product development programs in inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  thrombocytopenia and asthma  as well as in cancer 
we have not been profitable and have incurred operating losses since we were incorporated in june the extent of our future losses and the timing of potential profitability are highly uncertain  and we may never achieve profitable operations 
we incurred net losses of approximately million in  million in and million in currently  our revenues are generated solely from research milestone payments pursuant to our collaboration agreements and licenses and are insufficient to generate profitable operations 
in addition  we have funded our operations primarily through private and public offerings of our common stock 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur losses for at least the next several years and expect that these losses could increase as we expand our research and development activities and incur significant clinical and testing costs 
until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue  we expect to finance future cash needs through collaboration and licensing arrangements or public and or private equity or debt offerings  as well as through interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances and short term investments 
for the foreseeable future  our operations will require significant additional funding  in large part due to our research and development expenses  future preclinical and clinical testing costs  and the absence of any revenues from product sales 
the amount of future funds needed will depend largely on the timing and structure of potential future collaborations 
with the exception of milestone and royalty payments that we may receive under our existing collaborations  we do not currently have any commitments for future funding 
we continue to pursue a collaboration partner for our lead product candidate  r  prior to initiating phase clinical trials 
we have engaged in discussions with various parties regarding such a partnership 
at the present time  while we have parties who have indicated an interest in entering into a partnership for r  we believe we will be able to negotiate a more attractive arrangement for us and our stockholders once we have the results from the two phase b clinical trials of r  taski and taski the results from these two clinical trials are expected to be available in july and august  respectively 
we will have to raise additional capital if we do not identify a collaboration partner for r recently  the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
these events have generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain 
as a result of these and other factors  we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on reasonable terms 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to support our current and projected funding requirements through at least the next months 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our product candidates and other research and development activities  including risks and uncertainties that could impact the rate of progress of our development activities  we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials and other research and development activities 
corporate collaborations we conduct research and development programs independently and in connection with our corporate collaborations 
we currently have collaborations with six major pharmaceutical biotechnology companies 
these collaborations include a collaboration with janssen pharmaceutica nv  a division of 
table of contents johnson johnson  relating to oncology therapeutics and diagnostics  two collaborations with pfizer  one initiated in in immunology and the other in january  relating to intrapulmonary asthma and allergy therapeutics  a collaboration with novartis pharma ag  or novartis  with respect to four different programs relating to immunology  oncology and chronic bronchitis  a collaboration with daiichi pharmaceuticals co  ltd  or daiichi  relating to oncology  a collaboration with merck co  inc  or merck  also relating to oncology  and a collaboration with merck serono  relating to our aurora kinase inhibitor program 
none of these collaborations currently provides us with regular research reimbursement 
in all of these collaborations  if certain conditions are met  we are entitled to receive future milestone payments and royalties 
we cannot guarantee that these conditions will be met or that research and development efforts will be successful 
as a result  we may not receive any further milestone payments or royalties under these agreements 
recent developments in february  we announced that we have cut our research programs in virology and oncology as well as terminated certain related development and administrative staff  which resulted in the dismissal of employees  or approximately of our workforce 
this measure is intended to maintain our emphasis on active preclinical and clinical programs  while conserving our resources 
we are still assessing the restructuring and other charges associated with this measure  which are expected to be recorded in the first quarter of equity financings during the first quarter of  we completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to terms of the research collaborations ie amortization of upfront fees and certain milestone payments  investments  stock compensation  impairment issues  the estimated useful life of assets and contingencies  on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies during the year ended december  as compared to those previously disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue from our collaboration arrangements 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are evaluated under emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of any undelivered items 
the 
table of contents consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
non refundable  up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology access fees  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods of continuing involvement  generally the research term 
when a research term is not specified  we estimate the time it will take us to complete our deliverables under the contract and recognize the upfront fee using the straight line method over that time period 
we review our estimates every quarter for reasonableness 
revenue related to collaborative research with our corporate collaborators is recognized as research services are performed over the related development periods for each contract 
under these agreements  we are required to perform research and development activities as specified in the applicable agreement 
the payments received are not refundable and are generally based on a contractual cost per full time equivalent employee working on the project 
our research and development expenses under the collaborative research agreements  except for the merck collaboration signed in november related to ubiquitin ligases  approximate or exceed the revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements 
for the merck collaboration  we recognized a pro rata portion of the invoiced amounts for funding of our research scientists based on the headcount dedicated to the project 
when the research portion of the collaboration ended in may  we recognized the full amount of the deferred revenue related to the contract because we had no further obligations under the merck collaboration 
it is our policy to recognize revenue based on our level of effort expended  and that revenue recognized will not exceed amounts billable under the arrangement 
revenues associated with at risk milestones pursuant to collaborative agreements are recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones as set forth in the applicable agreement 
stock based compensation total stock based compensation expense related to our officers  directors and all other employees and consultants stock option plans that we recognized for the year ended december   and was comprised as follows aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands stock based compensation expense from officer  director and employee options consultant options total we grant options to purchase our common stock to our officers  directors and all other employees and consultants under our stock option plans 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to the lesser of of the fair market value on the first day of the offering period or of the fair market value on the purchase date under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp 
the benefits provided under these plans are stock based payments subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment revised  or sfas no 
r 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application transition method 
under this method  the stock based compensation costs recognized beginning january  include compensation costs for i all stock based payments granted prior to  but not vested as of january   based on the grant 
table of contents date fair value originally estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 
 and ii all stock based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r and staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab for awards granted on or after  january   we adopted the use of the straight line attribution method over the requisite service period for the entire award 
in addition  pursuant to sfas no 
r  we estimate the amount of expected forfeitures when calculating compensation costs  then record actual forfeitures as they occur 
we review our forfeiture rates each quarter and make any necessary changes to our estimates 
in january  we granted  shares of stock options to our employees 
due to a higher stock price and volatility rate on the grant date  the valuation for these stock options was approximately million 
the increase of stock based compensation expense in was mainly due to the amortization of expense associated with the january grant 
we also record charges associated with options granted to consultants reflecting the fair value valuation and periodic fair value re measurement of outstanding consultant options under eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  or eitf the valuation is based upon the current market value of our common stock and other assumptions  including the expected future volatility of our stock price  risk free interest rate and expected term 
for consultant options granted on or after january   we amortized stock based compensation using a straight line attribution method consistent with the method used for employees and with the attribution election we made upon adoption of sfas no 
r 
for options granted prior to january   we used the accelerated method for expensing stock based compensation  which was the method we used prior to adoption of sfas no 
r 
as of september   all of our outstanding consultant options were fully vested and the related stock based compensation expenses were fully recognized 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate and dividends 
we estimate volatility over the expected term of the option using historical share price performance 
for expected term  among other things  we take into consideration our historical data of options exercised  cancelled and expired 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury constant maturity rate 
we have not paid and do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
in order to calculate stock based compensation expense  we also estimate the forfeiture rate using our historical experience with options that cancel before they vest 
research and development accruals we have various contracts with third parties related to our research and development activities 
costs that are incurred but not billed to us as of the end of the period are accrued 
we make estimates of the amounts incurred in each period based on the information available to us and our knowledge of the nature of the contractual activities generating such costs 
clinical trial contract expenses are accrued based on units of activity completed and reported by third parties 
expenses related to other research and development contracts  such as research contracts  toxicology study contracts and manufacturing contracts are estimated to be incurred generally on a straight line basis over the duration of the contracts 
raw materials and study materials purchased by the third parties are expensed at the time of purchase 
many of our estimates are based significantly or in part on information provided by the third parties 
if such information were not reported properly  our research and development expense amounts could be misstated 

table of contents results of operations years ended december   and revenues aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands contract revenues from collaborations revenues by collaborator were aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands pfizer merck merck serono total there were no contract revenues reported during the year ended december  because there was no milestone triggering activity in and the research portion of the merck collaboration ended in may contract revenues from collaborations in consisted primarily of a million milestone payment from pfizer  a million milestone payment from merck serono and million in full time equivalent  or fte  and license revenue from merck 
the decrease in revenues in  as compared to the similar period in  was primarily due to the recognition of milestone payments totaling million and the full amortization of an upfront payment of million from merck serono  each in contract revenues from collaborations in and consisted primarily of milestone payments  amortization of upfront fees  and research support 
we had no deferred revenue as of december  our potential future revenues may include certain milestone payments from our current collaboration partners or new collaboration partners we enter into agreements with in the future 
research and development aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands research and development expenses stock based compensation expense included in research and development expenses the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  was primarily due to an increase in clinical costs  as well as stock based compensation expense as discussed under stock based compensation above  partially offset by the decrease in bonus expense in as we will not pay any bonuses for the increase in clinical costs was primarily attributable to increased costs associated with our two phase b clinical trials taski and taski  as well as the related extension trials in ra patients and manufacturing r material to be used in these clinical trials 
the increase in research and development expenses in  as compared to the similar period in  was due to an increase in clinical costs and personnel costs  offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense  as discussed under stock based compensation of this annual report on form k 
the increase in clinical costs was primarily 
table of contents attributable to costs associated with our phase a clinical trials of r in ra and our phase clinical trials of r in itp and b cell lymphoma 
the increase in personnel costs was attributable to a company wide bonus program implemented in the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict given the number of clinical trials that we will need to conduct for any of our potential products  as well as our limited capital resources 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps  beginning with identification of a potential target and including  among others  proof of concept in animals and phase  and clinical trials in humans 
each of these steps is typically more expensive than the previous step 
success in early stages of development often results in increasing expenditures for a given product candidate 
our research and development expenditures currently include costs for scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  consultants  sponsored research  allocated facility costs  costs related to preclinical and clinical trials  and stock based compensation 
general and administrative expenses aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands general and administrative expenses stock based compensation expense included in general and administrative expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  was primarily attributable to an increase in stock based compensation expense  as discussed under stock based compensation above  as well as an increase in legal costs associated with the expansion of our patent portfolio  partially offset by the decrease in bonus expense in as we will not pay any bonuses for the increase in general and administrative expenses in  as compared to the similar period in  was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel costs due to a new company wide bonus program implemented in  as well as an increase in legal costs associated with the expansion of our patent portfolio 
due to the purported securities class action lawsuit recently filed against us  we expect that our legal expenses will increase in as we will vigorously defend the lawsuit 
interest income aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands interest income interest income results from our interest bearing cash and investment balances

determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock  or eitf eitf provides guidance on how to determine whether certain instruments or features were indexed to the company s own stock 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we evaluated the impact of adopting eitf and concluded the adoption will have no material effect on our financial statements 
on december   the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements  or eitf eitf defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and third parties 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
we are evaluating the impact of adopting eitf on our financial statements and can not estimate the impact of adoption at this time 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
entities that elect the fair value option will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option may be elected on an instrument by instrument basis  with few exceptions 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities 
we adopted sfas no 
on january   but did not elect the fair value option to measure eligible items 
accordingly  this statement had no effect on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements we have financed our operations from inception primarily through sales of equity securities  contract payments under our collaboration agreements and equipment financing arrangements 
we have consumed substantial amounts of capital to date  and our operating expenditures are expected to 
table of contents increase over the next several years  in large part due to our research and development expenses  future preclinical and clinical testing costs and the absence of any revenues from product sales 
in the first quarter of  we completed a public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  as compared to approximately million as of december   an increase of approximately million 
the increase was primarily attributable to net proceeds from our public offering in the first quarter of  offset by operating spending for the twelve months ended december  we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to support our current and projected funding requirements through at least the next months 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our product candidates and other research and development activities  including risks and uncertainties that could impact the rate of progress of our development activities  we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials and other research and development activities 
our operations will require significant additional funding for the foreseeable future 
the amount of future funds needed will depend largely on the timing and structure of potential future collaborations 
until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue  we expect to finance future cash needs through public and or private equity offerings  debt financings or collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as through interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances and short term investments 
with the exception of milestone and royalty payments that we may receive under our existing collaborations  we do not currently have any commitments for future funding 
recently  the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
these events have generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain 
as a result of these and other factors  we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will be able to obtain financing on reasonable terms 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders could at that time experience substantial dilution 
any debt financing that we are able to obtain may involve operating covenants that restrict our business 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
our future funding requirements will depend upon many factors  including  but not limited to the progress and success of clinical trials and preclinical activities including studies and manufacture of materials of our product candidates conducted by us or our collaborative partners or licensees  our ability to establish new collaborations and the terms thereof  the progress of research programs carried out by us  any changes in the breadth of our research and development programs  our ability to meet the milestones identified in our collaborative agreements that trigger payments  
table of contents the progress of the research and development efforts of our collaborative partners  our ability to acquire or license other technologies or compounds that we seek to pursue  our ability to manage our growth  competing technological and market developments  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending our patent and intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals and filings by us and our collaborators  and expenses associated with the pending and potential additional related purported securities class action lawsuits  as well as any unforeseen litigation 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
for the twelve months ended december  and  we maintained an investment portfolio primarily in money market funds  u 
s 
treasury bills  government sponsored enterprise securities  and corporate bonds and commercial paper 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash used in operating activities was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the continued increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the increase in payments made as we continue to expand our research and development activities 
the timing of cash requirements may vary from period to period depending on our research and development activities  including our planned preclinical and clinical trials  and future requirements to establish commercial capabilities for any products that we may develop 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in net cash provided by investing activities in was million 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities in compared with related primarily to purchases of short term investments  partially offset by maturities of short term investments 
in  maturities of available for sale securities were higher than purchases of available for sale securities resulting in cash provided by investing activities 
capital expenditures were million in compared to  in and  in net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increases in net cash provided by financing activities in and were mainly due to the public offerings we completed in and we did not have any public offerings in in the first quarter of  we completed a public offering in which 
table of contents we received net proceeds of approximately million 
in the second quarter of  we completed a public offering in which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
proceeds from capital lease financing were million in compared to  and million in and  respectively 
payments on capital lease obligations for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no contractual arrangements that create potential material risk for us and are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   which only consists of capital lease and facility lease obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations facilities lease total as of december   we had million in capital lease obligations  including principal and interest  associated with our equipment additions 
all existing capital lease agreements as of december  are secured by the equipment financed  bearing interest at rates in a range of to and are due in monthly installments through item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value amount of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and available for sale securities in a variety of securities  including money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
in  and  we maintained an investment portfolio primarily in money market funds  u 
s 
treasury bills  government sponsored enterprise securities  and corporate bonds and commercial paper 
due to the primarily short term nature of these investments  we believe we do not have a material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
in addition  we believe we have no incremental or new risk related to recent credit market volatility 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided 
we have operated primarily in the united states  and all funding activities with our collaborators to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
