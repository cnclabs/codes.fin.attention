in the past  we have been impacted by industry consolidation 
while average core product unit prices tend to decline as a result of consolidation  we look to negotiate higher volumes and capitalize on opportunities to sell additional products and services to offset the decline in prices 
however  given significant financial stress impacting financial markets and reduced willingness to extend credit  past experience may or may not continue in the current market 
given the slowing global economic growth and challenging business environment  we continue to focus on our initiatives to reduce and manage our expenses  while trying to preserve our operating margins  earnings performance and cash flows from operations

revenues in our ocis and credit marketing services service lines and in our uscis segment as a whole decreased sequentially in each quarter during  as a result of the weakening us economy 
based on current rates of economic and credit activity in the us  we currently expect revenue in the ocis and credit marketing services service lines and in the overall uscis segment in to be below levels achieved in ocis

credit marketing services 
for and  as compared to prior years  revenue declined due to volume decreases from our existing customer base  primarily due to lower revenue associated with new account acquisition services as financial institutions have scaled back significantly on new marketing and extension of credit 
these declines were partially offset by a continued increase in revenue related to customer portfolio management services used by institutions to manage and sustain existing customers 
our financial services customers began increased usage of our portfolio management services in and less usage of prescreen services  which reflects a continuing trend towards the enhanced management of their existing customer portfolios as opposed to new account acquisitions

with a high portion of fixed costs  uscis operating expenses generally do not decline at the same rate as our revenue

recognizing the continuing impact in of current economic conditions  management has taken and is continuing to take steps to streamline operations and increase efficiency in order to minimize the potential negative effect on operating margins of lower annual revenue 
the decline in operating margin  as compared to  was primarily a result of the fixed cost nature of the uscis business in the midst of revenue declines in our mortgage solutions  credit marketing services and direct marketing services business units 
while revenue of the entire uscis business was essentially flat  the operating expense of maintaining the databases  products  and customer support capabilities required for the business increased by  reflecting annual compensation increases and enhanced product  processing and support capabilities

despite the capital markets turmoil that emerged in september  which had an adverse impact on our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of funds in the fourth quarter  we continue to have access to short term liquidity through our senior credit facility 
conditions have improved and we have returned to utilization of our commercial paper program since year end  however  if conditions were to deteriorate  we are able to rely on our senior credit facility  which does not mature until july at december   we had million available to borrow on our senior credit facility

additionally  our senior credit facility does not include a provision under which lenders could refuse to allow us to borrow under this facility in the event of a material adverse change in our financial condition as long as we are in compliance with the covenants in the agreement 
we believe that funds generated from expected results of operations and available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to finance our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements such as capital expenditures  interest payments  potential pension funding contributions  dividend payments and stock repurchases  if any for the foreseeable future 
if the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and the availability of funds remains limited in  we could incur increased costs associated with issuing commercial paper and or other debt instruments 
in addition  it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited by these or other factors at a time when we would like  or need  to do so  which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions

in  net borrowing activity under our commercial paper program was partially offset by net repayments under our trade receivables backed revolving credit facility  which we elected to terminate on november  the net short term repayments borrowings represent activity under our trade receivables backed revolving credit facility 
net borrowings repayments under long term revolving credit facilities during  and relate to activity on our senior credit facility 
borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchase programs 
in  the net borrowing activity under long term revolving credit facilities primarily represents our pay down of million of commercial paper notes outstanding at december  from cash from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility to lower the average cost of our debt and due to the adverse conditions in the commercial paper market discussed above 
in  the net borrowing activity under long term revolving credit facilities primarily represents our refinancing of the million principal amount relating to our notes in november during  we purchased million principal amount of the ten year senior notes issued in for million 
there were no material payments on long term debt during on june   we issued million principal amount of  ten year senior notes and million principal amount of  thirty year senior notes  which we refer to collectively as the senior notes  in underwritten public offerings 
we used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes to reduce the amount outstanding in our commercial paper program 
in conjunction with the sale of the senior notes  we entered into cash flow hedges on million and million notional amount  respectively  of ten year and thirty year treasury notes 
these hedges were settled in cash on june and   respectively  the date the senior notes were sold  requiring a cash payment by us of million and million  respectively 
there were no material proceeds from the issuance of long term debt during and debt covenants 
our outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on the incurrence of secured debt and sale leaseback transactions 
in addition  our senior credit facility and canadian credit facility each require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than to our leverage ratio was to at december  none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and  as of december   we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
we do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our outstanding debt  however  our senior notes  discussed above  contain change in control provisions 
if we experience a change of control or publicly announce our intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by each of standard poor s  or s p  and moody s investors service  or moody s  below an investment grade rating within days of such change of control or notice thereof  then we will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 
credit ratings 
credit ratings reflect an independent agency s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity 
the ratings reflect many considerations  such as the nature of the borrower s industry and its competitive position  the size of the company  its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company s cash flows to changes in the economy 
the two largest rating agencies  s p and moody s  use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings 
the highest quality rating for long term credit obligations is aaa and aaa for s p and moody s  respectively 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 
long term ratings of bbb and baa or better by s p and moody s  respectively  reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade 
at december   the long term ratings for our obligations were bbb and baa  which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at december  a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our commercial paper program and credit facilities  and could limit  or in the case of a significant downgrade  preclude our ability to issue commercial paper 
if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels  we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt 
in addition  the market s demand for  and thus our ability to readily issue  new debt could become further influenced by the economic and credit market environment

equity transactions net cash provided by used in twelve months ended december  change dollars in millions vs 
vs 
treasury stock repurchases dividends paid proceeds from exercise of stock options excess tax benefits from stock based compensation plans sources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended december   and were as follows under share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors  we purchased million  million and million common shares on the open market during the twelve months ended december   and  respectively  for million  million and million  respectively  at an average price per common share of  and  respectively 
at december   the company had million remaining for stock repurchases under the existing board authorization 
as of february   we had acquired an additional million shares for million since december  during the twelve months ended december   and  we paid cash dividends of million  million and million  respectively  at per share for all periods 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  the table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time 
some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table 
payments due by in millions total less than year to years to years thereafter debt operating leases data processing  outsourcing agreements and other purchase obligations other long term liabilities interest payments the amounts are gross of unamortized discounts totaling million and a purchase accounting fair value adjustment of million at december  total debt on our consolidated balance sheets is net of the unamortized discounts and fair value adjustment 
our operating lease obligations principally involve office space and equipment  which includes the lease associated with our headquarters building that expires in and the ground lease associated with our headquarters building that expires in these agreements primarily represent our minimum contractual obligations for services that we outsource associated with our computer data processing operations and related functions  and certain administrative functions 
these agreements expire between and these long term liabilities primarily relate to obligations associated with certain pension  postretirement and other compensation related plans  some of which are discounted in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
we made certain assumptions about the timing of such future payments 
in the table above  we have not included amounts related to future pension plan obligations  as such required funding amounts beyond have not been deemed necessary due to our current expectations regarding future plan asset performance 
during january  we made a million contribution to fund our equifax inc pension plan 
for future interest payments on related variable rate debt  which is generally based on libor or commercial paper plus a specified margin  we used the variable rate in effect at december  to calculate these payments 
the variable portion of the rate at december  excluding the margin and facility fees was between and for substantially all of our variable rate debt 
future interest payments related to our million revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program are based on the borrowings outstanding at december  through their respective maturity dates  assuming such borrowings are outstanding until that time 
future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity under this revolving credit facility 
this table excludes million of unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
a potential significant future use of cash would be the payment to computer sciences corporation  or csc  if it were to exercise its option to sell its credit reporting business to us at any time prior to the option exercise price would be determined by agreement or by an appraisal process and would be due in cash within days after the exercise of the option 
we estimate that if the option had been exercised at december   the price range would have been approximately million to million 
this estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the business  current market conditions and other factors  all of which are subject to constant change 
therefore  the actual option exercise price could be materially higher or lower than our estimate 
our agreement with csc  which expires on july   also provides us with an option to purchase its credit reporting business if it does not elect to renew the agreement or if there is a change in control of csc while the agreement is in effect 
if csc were to exercise its option  or if we were able to and decided to exercise our option  then we would have to obtain additional sources of funding 
we believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the capital markets for debt and or equity financing 
however  the availability and terms of any such capital financing would be subject to a number of factors  including credit market conditions  the state of the equity markets  general economic conditions  our credit ratings and our financial performance and condition 
off balance sheet transactions other than facility leasing arrangements and limited foreign currency hedge activity  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities 
in  we entered into a synthetic lease on our atlanta corporate headquarters building in order to obtain favorable financing terms with regard to this facility 
this million lease expires in march lease payments for the remaining term totaled million at december  under this synthetic lease arrangement  we have guaranteed the residual value of the leased property to the lessor 
in the event that the property were to be sold by the lessor at the end of the lease term  we would be responsible for any shortfall of the sales proceeds  up to a maximum amount of million  which equals of the value of the property at the beginning of the lease term 
the liability for this shortfall  which was million at december   is recorded in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
pursuant to the terms of the industrial revenue bonds  we transferred title of certain fixed assets with a cost of million  as of december   to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development 
the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds 
these fixed assets are still recognized in the company s consolidated balance sheet as all risks and rewards remain with the company 
letters of credit and guarantees we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit  performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business 
the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december   and all have a maturity of two years or less 
guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units 
in connection with the sale of our risk management collections business to rma holdings  llc  or rma  in october  we guaranteed the operating lease payments of a partnership affiliated with rma to a lender of the partnership pursuant to a term loan 
the operating lease  which expires december   has a remaining balance of million  based on the undiscounted value of remaining lease payments  including real estate taxes  at december  on september   rma sold substantially all of its assets to nco group  inc  or nco 
in conjunction with this sale  nco agreed to assume the operating lease obligations discussed above  which we will continue to guarantee 
we believe that the likelihood of demand for payment by us is minimal and expect no material losses to occur related to this guarantee 
accordingly  we do not have a liability on our consolidated balance sheets at december  or related to this guarantee 
benefit plans at december   our us retirement income plan  or usrip  and the equifax inc pension plan  or eipp  met or exceeded erisa s minimum funding requirements 
in january  and  we made contributions of million  million and million  respectively  to the eipp 
we also made a million discretionary contribution in to fund certain other post retirement benefit plans 
in the future  we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions  depending on certain circumstances  including market conditions and liquidity needs 
we believe additional funding contributions  if any  would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs  which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities  available cash and cash equivalents  and our credit facilities 
for our non us  tax qualified retirement plans  we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations 
for the non qualified supplementary retirement plans  we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants  but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap 
for additional information about our benefit plans  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
seasonality we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams 
revenue generated from the work number and tax and talent management business units within the talx operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year 
revenue from our ocis and mortgage solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions  most commonly the second and third calendar quarters 
effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates equifax s operating results are not materially affected by inflation  although inflation may result in increases in the company s expenses  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments  it may adversely affect the company s financial position and profitability 
a significant portion of the company s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of non us dollar net assets  revenues and expenses 
potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored 
although the company historically has not adopted strategies designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on the company s financial performance  where cost justified the company may elect to do so in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap 
this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results 
for additional information about these policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information available at the time 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured  the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed 
if at the outset of an arrangement  we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment 
if there is uncertainty as to the customer s acceptance of our deliverables  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
if at the outset of an arrangement  we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes estimable  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we have certain information solution offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements 
to account for each of these elements separately  the delivered elements must have stand alone value to our customer  and there must exist objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for any undelivered elements 
judgments and uncertainties each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables 
these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value  concluding when the element will be delivered  and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services 
for certain contracts containing multiple elements  the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their relative fair values and to the initial delivered elements using the residual method 
if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate elements for accounting or fair value is not known for any undelivered elements  arrangement consideration may only be recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer 
in addition  the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates  principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears 
in these instances  we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past 
differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 
effects if actual results differ from assumptions we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past 
we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates  revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future  we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  or competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
judgments and uncertainties the provisions of sfas require that we perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are one level below our operating segments and represent our various business lines 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
sfas also requires that the fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives be estimated and compared to the carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using an income approach 
we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite lived intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital charges 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
additionally  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
loss contingencies we are subject to various proceedings  lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we determine whether to disclose and or accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable  reasonably possible or remote 
judgments and uncertainties we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability in our consolidated balance sheet for the estimated settlement costs 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible  but not probable  we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency 
our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies 
however  if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates  we may be exposed to a loss that could be material 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid 
we periodically assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable 
our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities 
we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations 
regularly  we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals 
judgments and uncertainties we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income  mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions  and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and  if so  the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements 
we regularly review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances  such as changes in tax law  interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law 
these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense 
settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash 
at december   we have million recorded for uncertain tax benefits  including interest and penalties  of which it is reasonably possible that up to million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material 
pension and other postretirement plans our pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost as required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pension  or sfas  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  which include discount rates  salary growth  expected return on plan assets  interest cost and mortality rates 
judgments and uncertainties we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
we determine our discount rates primarily based on high quality  fixed income investments and yield to maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date 
discount rates are reset annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions 
we use a publicly published yield curve updated monthly to develop our discount rates 
the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated high quality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period  from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class  as provided by our external investment advisor 
prior to  the us pension plans investment returns were  and over three  five and ten years  respectively 
the returns exceeded the s p returns for similar periods of time primarily due to an asset allocation strategy where large allocations to alternative asset classes hedge fund of funds  private equity  real estate and real assets provided consistently higher returns with a low correlation to equity market returns 
these returns historically demonstrate a long term record of producing returns at or above the expected rate of return 
in  the investment returns were approximately negative  exceeding the s p index returns over negative  and again reflecting the asset allocation benefit 
we feel investment market returns were abnormal and are not reflective of our expected future investment returns 
our external investment advisor has provided projected ten year investment returns by asset class and  based on our asset allocation strategy  the expected return assumes a return to pre historical trends 
under sfas  the expected long term rate of return is calculated on the market related value of assets 
sfas allows for the use of an asset value that smoothes actual investment gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets over a period up to five years 
we have elected to smooth asset gains and losses on our pension plans over the five year period 
annual differences  if any  between the expected and actual returns are included in the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount 
we generally amortize any unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss  in accordance with sfas  in net periodic pension expense over the average future service of active employees or over the remaining lifespan for retired participants 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material 
adjusting our expected long term rate of return at december  by would change our estimated pension expense in by approximately million 
adjusting our weighted average discount rate at december  by would change our estimated pension expense in by approximately million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of our business  we are exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  that could impact our results of operations and financial position 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities  and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to hedge certain of these exposures 
we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a substantial majority of our revenue  expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do transact business in other currencies  primarily the british pound  the chilean peso  the euro  the canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
for most of these foreign currencies  we are a net recipient  and  therefore  benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 
we are required to translate  or express in us dollars  the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable year end rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year 
we record the resulting translation adjustment  and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a long term investment nature within other comprehensive income  as a component of our shareholders equity 
other immaterial foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates  although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 
for the year ended december   a weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during would have increased our revenue by million and our pre tax operating profit by million 
for the year ended december   a weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during would have increased our revenue by million and our pre tax operating profit by million 
a stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pre tax operating profit for and interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variable rate  long term senior credit facility and commercial paper borrowings 
we attempt to achieve the lowest all in weighted average cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt  and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt 
at december   our weighted average cost of debt was and weighted average life of debt was years 
at december   of our debt was fixed rate  and the remaining was variable rate 
occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps 
a change in the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt would have reduced our net income by approximately million 
based on the amount of outstanding variable rate debt  we have material exposure to interest rate risk 
in the future  if our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variable rate debt  we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk 
the nature and amount of our long term and short term debt  as well as the proportionate amount of fixed rate and variable rate debt  can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors
