table of contents significant financial and other highlights significant financial and other highlights for the year ended december  include we generated  million in total consolidated revenues and  million in consolidated operating income  resulting in year over year growth of and in total consolidated revenues and operating income  respectively 
we incurred million of restructuring and related expenses as described within operating expenses overview 
during the year ended december   we incurred a million accelerated stock based compensation vesting charge related to an affiliate of kohlberg kravis roberts co s kkr acquisition of first data corporation first data on september  as described within operating expenses overview 
our operating income margin was during the year ended december  resulting in a year over year decline of due primarily to the restructuring and related expenses described above 
consolidated net income during was million  representing an increase of from we completed million consumer to consumer transactions worldwide  an increase of over our consumers transferred billion in consumer to consumer transactions  of which billion related to cross border transactions  which represented an increase of in consumer to consumer transactions and a increase in cross border transactions over prior year 
we completed million consumer to business transactions  representing an increase of over the prior year 
consolidated cash flow provided by operating activities was  million  an increase of over factors that we believe are important to our long term success include accelerating profitable growth in our existing consumer to consumer business  expanding and globalizing our consumer to business segment and increasing the number of bill payment options  innovating to provide new products and services to our target consumer  and improving our profitability by leveraging our scale  reducing costs and effectively utilizing capital 
significant factors affecting our financial position and results of operations include transaction volume is the primary generator of revenue in our businesses 
transaction volume in our consumer to consumer segment is affected by  among other things  the size of the international migrant population and individual needs to transfer funds in emergency situations 
as noted elsewhere in this annual report on form k  a reduction in the size of the migrant population  interruptions in migration patterns or reduced employment opportunities including those resulting from any changes in immigration laws  economic development patterns or political events  could adversely affect our transaction volume 
for discussion on how these factors have impacted us in recent periods  refer to the consumer to consumer segment discussion below 
revenue is also impacted by changes in the fees we charge consumers  the amount of money sent  and by the variance in the exchange rate set by us to the consumer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency 
we intend to continue to implement strategic pricing reductions  actions to reduce foreign exchange spreads  where appropriate  taking into account growth opportunities and including competitive factors 
decreases in our fees or foreign exchange spreads generally reduce margins  but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time 
as mentioned above  revenue is impacted by the principal per transaction 
in  our consumer to consumer principal per transaction increased over the prior year 
however  in the fourth quarter versus the comparable period in the prior year  consumer to consumer principal per transaction declined  a trend we expect to continue in 
table of contents the weakening economy in the united states has adversely impacted our consumer to consumer and consumer to business segments throughout the year and the more recent global economic crisis has adversely impacted our fourth quarter results and continues to impact us 
we continue to face robust competition in both our consumer to consumer and consumer to business segments from a variety of money transfer and consumer payment providers 
we believe the most significant competitive factors in the consumer to consumer segment relate to brand recognition  trust and reliability  distribution network  consumer experience and price and in the consumer to business segment relate to brand recognition  trust and reliability  convenience  speed  variety of payment methods and price 
regulation of the money transfer industry is increasing 
the number and complexity of regulations around the world and the pace at which regulation is changing are factors that pose significant challenges to our business 
we continue to implement policies and programs and adapt our business practices and strategies to help us comply with current legal requirements  as well as with new and changing legal requirements affecting particular services  or the conduct of our business in general 
our activities include dedicated compliance personnel  training and monitoring programs  government relations and regulatory outreach efforts  and support and guidance to the agent network on compliance programs 
these efforts increase our costs of doing business 
the separation of western union from first data on january   the first data board of directors announced its intention to pursue the distribution of of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses related assets  through a tax free distribution to first data shareholders 
effective on september   first data completed the separation and the distribution of these businesses the distribution 
prior to the distribution  our company had been a segment of first data 
subsequent to the spin off from first data  we have recognized higher interest expense as a result of the debt that was issued to effect the spin off 
we have also recorded higher expenses related to being a stand alone company  as further described below in basis of presentation 
basis of presentation the financial statements in this annual report on form k for periods ending on or after the distribution are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of our company and its majority owned subsidiaries 
the financial statements for the periods presented prior to the distribution are presented on a combined basis and represent those entities that were ultimately transferred to our company in connection with the spin off 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions between our company s segments have been eliminated 
the historical consolidated statements of income include expense allocations for certain corporate functions historically provided to western union by first data  including treasury  tax  accounting and reporting  mergers and acquisitions  risk management  legal  internal audit  procurement  human resources  investor relations and information technology 
if possible  these allocations were made on a specific identification basis 
otherwise  the expenses related to services provided to western union by first data were allocated to western union based on the relative percentages  as compared to first data s other businesses  of headcount or other appropriate methods depending on the nature of each item of cost to be allocated 
pursuant to a transition services agreement we entered into with first data prior to the spin off  first data provided western union with certain of these services at prices agreed upon by first data and western union 
the transition services agreement expired on september  the costs historically allocated to us by first data for the services provided to us were lower than the costs we have incurred and will continue to incur following the spin off 
certain expenses related to being a stand alone company  reflected in the consolidated statements of income  are higher than the historical amounts prior to the spin off 
the financial information presented in this annual report on form k prior to the spin off date of september  does not reflect what our 
table of contents consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows would have been as a stand alone company during the periods presented and is not necessarily indicative of our future consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
subsequent event in february  we entered into an agreement to acquire the money transfer business of european based fexco  one of our largest agents providing services in the united kingdom  spain  ireland and other european countries 
prior to the acquisition  we hold a interest in fexco group holdings fexco group  which is a holding company for both the money transfer business as well as various unrelated businesses 
we will surrender our interest in fexco group and pay million approximately million based on currency exchange rates at deal signing as consideration for the overall money transfer business 
the acquisition is expected to close in the first half of  subject to regulatory approvals and satisfaction of closing conditions 
the acquisition will be recognized at of the fair value of the money transfer business  which will exceed the cash consideration of million given the non cash consideration conveyed via the sale of our interest in fexco group 
the fair value of the money transfer business will be determined upon closing and is subject to fluctuation due to changes in exchange rates and other valuation inputs 
adoption of accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
effective january   we determine the fair market values of our financial assets and liabilities  as well as non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis  based on the fair value hierarchy established in sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
western union s financial instruments that base fair value determinations on level inputs are not material 
level observable inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
most of our assets and liabilities fall within level and include state and municipal debt instruments  other foreign investment securities  and derivative assets and liabilities 
we utilize pricing services to value our level financial instruments 
for most of these assets  we utilize pricing services that use multiple prices as inputs to determine daily market values 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
level assets and liabilities include items where the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 
we currently have no level assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
pursuant to the financial accounting standards boards fasb staff position no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp no 
 the effective date of sfas no 
for certain non financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value but are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a non recurring basis has been deferred to fiscal years beginning after november  we are primarily impacted by this deferral as it relates to non financial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination but not measured at fair value in subsequent periods and fair value measurements in impairment testing 
we adopted these remaining provisions of sfas no 
effective january  we do not expect the impact to be significant on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
due to the nature of our investment securities  there have been no material changes to our valuation techniques during the year ended december  
table of contents fasb interpretation no 
we adopted the provisions of the fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  on january  fin addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
under fin  we recognize the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits of the position  that the tax position will be sustained upon examination  including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation 
the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized an increase in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits plus associated accrued interest and penalties of million  which was accounted for as a reduction to the january  balance of retained earnings 
refer to note income taxes in our historical consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the adoption of fin components of revenue and expenses the following briefly describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in the consolidated statements of income 
descriptions of our revenue recognition policies are included in note summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements 
transaction fees transaction fees are charged for sending money transfers and consumer to business payments 
consumer to consumer transaction fees generally vary according to the principal amount of the money transfer and the locations from and to which the funds are sent 
transaction fees represented of western union s total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  foreign exchange revenue in certain consumer money transfer transactions involving different send and receive currencies  we generate revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the consumer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency 
foreign exchange revenue growth has historically been driven principally by growth in international cross currency transactions 
foreign exchange revenue represented of western union s total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  commission and other revenues commission and other revenues represented of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended december  commission and other revenues primarily consist of commissions we receive in connection with the sale of money orders  enrollment fees received when consumers enroll in our equity accelerator program a recurring mortgage payment service program  and investment income primarily derived from interest generated on money transfer and payment services settlement assets as well as realized net gains and losses from such assets 
cost of services cost of services primarily consists of agent commissions and expenses for call centers  settlement operations  and related information technology costs 
expenses within these functions include personnel  software  equipment  telecommunications  bank fees  depreciation and amortization and other expenses incurred in connection with providing money transfer and other payment services 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative  or sg a  primarily consists of salaries  wages and related expenses paid to sales and administrative personnel  as well as certain advertising and promotional costs and other selling and administrative expenses 
prior to september   the date of the spin off  sg a also included allocations of general corporate overhead costs from first data 
interest income interest income consists of interest earned on cash balances not required to satisfy settlement obligations and in connection with loans made to several agents 
interest expense interest expense represents interest incurred in connection with outstanding borrowings payable  including applicable amounts associated with interest rate swaps  to third parties 

table of contents interest income from first data  net interest income from first data  net consists of interest income earned on notes receivable from first data  net of interest expense incurred on notes payable to first data 
all notes receivable and payable were settled in connection with the spin off on september  derivative losses gains  net represents the portion of the change in fair value that is excluded from the measure of effectiveness related to contracts designated as accounting hedges entered into on or after september  those amounts include a differences between changes in forward rates and spot rates  and b gains or losses on the contract and any offsetting positions during the periods in which the instrument is not designated as a hedge 
derivative gains and losses do not include fluctuations in foreign currency forward contracts intended to mitigate exposures on settlement activities of our money transfer business or on certain foreign currency denominated cash positions 
gains and losses associated with those foreign currency forward contracts are included in cost of services  consistent with exchange rate fluctuations on the related settlement assets  obligations and cash positions 
derivative gains and losses also include realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with certain foreign currency forward contracts that did not qualify as hedges under derivative accounting rules prior to september  foreign exchange effect on notes receivable from first data  net certain of the notes receivable from first data in our consolidated balance sheets prior to september   the spin off date  were repayable in euros  and certain of those euro denominated notes also had foreign currency swap agreements associated with them 
these notes receivable were translated based on current exchange rates between the euro and the united states dollar  and changes in fair value of the related foreign currency swap agreements were recorded based on current market valuations 
the effect of translation adjustments and recording the foreign currency swaps to market is reflected in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange effect on notes receivable from first data 
all notes receivable and payable with first data were settled in connection with the spin off on september  other income  net other income  net is comprised primarily of equity earnings from equity method investments and other income and expenses 
results of operations the following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and segment results refers to the year ended december  compared to the same period in and the year ended december  compared to the same period in the results of operations should be read in conjunction with the discussion of our segment results of operations  which provide more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of income 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions between our company s segments have been eliminated 
we incurred expenses of million for the year ended december  for restructuring and related activities  which have not been allocated to our segments 
while these items are identifiable to our segments  they are not included in the measurement of segment operating profit provided to the chief operating decision maker codm for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation

the majority of transaction fees and foreign exchange revenue are contributed by our consumer to consumer segment  which is discussed in greater detail in segment discussion 
consolidated revenue growth of and during the years ended december  and  respectively  was primarily driven by revenue growth internationally  particularly in the europe  middle east  africa and south asia emeasa region  due to increased money transfers at existing agent locations  and to a lesser extent  money transfers at new agent locations and due to the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues into the united states dollar  specifically the euro  discussed below 
our international consumer to consumer transactions that were originated outside of the united states also continued to experience strong revenue and 
table of contents transaction growth for the years ended december  and compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year 
we experienced strong growth in our money transfer business to india  and in the gulf states  which offset slower growth in certain european markets for the year ended compared to however  during the fourth quarter of  revenue was impacted by the weakening global economy and its effect on western union customers 
in the fourth quarter  transaction growth rates slowed sequentially compared to the first nine months of in addition  the amount of money remitted per transaction declined in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of these factors resulted in less transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and currencies other than the united states dollar for the year ended december  have resulted in a benefit to transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue of million  over the previous year  net of foreign currency hedges  that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates 
the positive impact to operating profit derived from foreign currency exchange rates increasing against the united states dollar during the year was offset by the impact of foreign currency derivative losses for those foreign currency derivatives not designated as hedges and the portion of fair value that is excluded from the measure of effectiveness for these contracts designated as hedges thereby resulting in a minimal impact to overall earnings per share 
transactions in the euro  which represent the majority of the company s foreign currency denominated business  benefited revenue by million and operating income by million during the year 
the benefit in the first three quarters of was slightly offset by the negative impact to consumer to consumer transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue in the fourth quarter of due to the strengthening of the united states dollar relative to certain other currencies  including the euro 
however  the impact to our operating income was positive to the fourth quarter of due to our derivative hedges 
if exchange rates between the united states dollar and other currencies remain constant with those experienced at the end of  or if other currencies continue to weaken against the united states dollar  we expect a negative impact on our revenue in however  the impact to earnings per share is expected to be less due to the impact of translation on our expenses and our hedging program 
the fluctuation in the exchange rate between the euro and the united states dollar which contributed to the majority of the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into united states dollars for the year ended december  resulted in a benefit to consumer to consumer transaction fee and foreign exchange of million  over the previous year  net of foreign currency hedges  that would not have occurred had there been a constant exchange rate 
for the year ended december  the related benefit to operating income was million 
our asia pacific apac region also experienced strong transaction and revenue growth during the years ended december  and compared to the corresponding previous periods  including growth contributed by the inbound market of the philippines 
revenue growth slowed in apac during the fourth quarter compared to the same period in  in part due to the weakening global economy described previously and the decline in high revenue transactions from small entrepreneurs that typically make purchases in china 
within our americas region which includes north america  latin america  the caribbean  and south america  our united states to mexico  united states outbound and transactions in our domestic between and within the united states and canada businesses continued to be impacted by the overall weakening in the united states economy 
the immigration debate and market softness  in part due to the slowdown in the construction industry  began adversely impacting the united states businesses in the second quarter of we responded to these factors by launching distribution  pricing  advertising  promotion and community outreach initiatives in and although the united states businesses revenue decline experienced in moderated compared with  we experienced increased revenue declines in the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of  due to the weakening in the united states economy 
foreign exchange revenue increased for the years ended december  and over the corresponding previous periods  due to an increase in cross currency transactions primarily as a result of growth 
table of contents in international consumer to consumer transactions 
as described above  foreign exchange revenue also benefited during the year ended december  compared to from the strengthening of other currencies most notably the euro  against the united states dollar 
we have historically implemented and will likely implement future strategic fee reductions and actions to reduce foreign exchange spreads  where appropriate  taking into account growth opportunities and competitive factors 
fee decreases and foreign exchange actions generally reduce margins  but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time 
such fee decreases and foreign exchange actions have impacted our annual consolidated revenue on average approximately during and and approximately in pago f cil  which was acquired in december  contributed million and million of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  and also contributed to consolidated revenue growth in compared to operating expenses overview the following factors impacted both cost of services and selling  general and administrative expenses during the periods presented restructuring and related activities in  we incurred restructuring and related expenses in conjunction with the decision to close our facilities in missouri and texas  including the elimination of approximately positions held by union employees and certain management positions in these same facilities  as well as other reorganizations 
the million of expenses incurred in were offset by operating expense savings of approximately million in and are expected to be offset by approximately million annually beginning in stock compensation charge at the time of the spin off  first data converted stock options  restricted stock awards  and restricted stock units collectively  stock based awards of first data stock held by western union and first data employees 
both western union and first data employees received converted western union stock based awards 
all converted stock based awards  which had not vested prior to september   were subject to the terms and conditions applicable to the original first data stock based awards  including change of control provisions which require full vesting upon a change of control of first data 
accordingly  upon the completion of the acquisition of first data on september  by an affiliate of kkr  all of these remaining converted unvested western union stock based awards vested 
in connection with this accelerated vesting  we incurred a non cash pre tax charge of million during the third quarter of approximately one third of this charge was recorded within cost of services and two thirds was recorded within selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
incremental independent public company expenses we recorded recurring incremental independent public company expenses of million and million in and  respectively  in the consolidated statements of income 
these expenses are those in excess of amounts allocated to us by first data prior to september  or beyond amounts we presume first data would have allocated subsequently thereto 
most of these expenses continue to be incurred in subsequent periods 
cost of services in addition to the restructuring costs described above  cost of services increased for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in primarily due to agent commissions which increase as revenues increase 
cost of services as a percentage of revenue was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the majority of the increase in cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in was 
table of contents primarily due to restructuring and related expenses of million as described above  and the shift in our business mix reflecting stronger growth from our international consumer to consumer business  which carries higher cost of services compared to our united states originated businesses 
selected consumer to consumer international agent commissions have been lowered but were partially offset by certain higher commissions in the united states 
in addition  a higher percentage of our consumer to business services were generated from our united states electronic based payments and payments related to pago f cil  each of which had higher cost of services as a percentage of revenue compared to our united states cash based payments business 
the increase was partially offset by lower stock compensation charges for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in  as described above and below  that did not recur in the majority of the increase in cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in was attributable to the shift in our business mix reflecting stronger growth from our international business  as described above 
the pago f cil business  which carries a lower margin than our existing consumer to business services  also contributed to the increase in cost of services 
the stock compensation charge resulting from the acquisition of first data  as described above  and incremental public company expenses were additional factors leading to the increase in cost of services in selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year due to higher employee compensation expenses and restructuring and related expenses of million  offset by better leverage of our marketing expenses as well as lower stock compensation charges in  as described above 
sg a expenses increased for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in primarily due to incremental public company expenses and the stock compensation charge related to kkr s acquisition of first data  as described above 
in addition  costs associated with the inclusion of the pago f cil business contributed to the increase in from during the year ended december   marketing related expenditures  principally classified within sg a  were approximately of revenue due to better leveraging of our marketing expenditures 
for the years ended december  and  marketing related expenditures were approximately and of revenue  respectively 
marketing related expenditures include advertising  events  loyalty programs and the cost of employees dedicated to marketing activities 
when making decisions with respect to marketing investments  we review opportunities for advertising and other marketing related expenditures together with opportunities for fee adjustments and other initiatives in order to best maximize the return on these investments 
such fee decreases and foreign exchange actions have impacted our annual consolidated revenue on average approximately during and and approximately in for further discussion regarding the impact of pricing decreases refer to the revenues overview discussion within the consumer to consumer segment section 
interest income interest income decreased during the year ended december  compared to due primarily to lower short term interest rates  and to a lesser extent  lower average interest bearing cash balances 
interest income increased during the year ended december  compared to due to higher international cash balances resulting from the net cash received in connection with the settlement of intercompany notes with first data net of certain other payments made to first data on the spin off date  and from cash generated through our international operations 
also contributing to higher interest income in compared to was interest income recorded in connection with a million loan made to one of our agents in the first quarter of 
table of contents interest expense interest expense decreased for the year ended december  compared to due to decreases in interest rates related to our floating rate debt 
interest expense increased for the year ended december  compared to due to interest expense on our outstanding borrowings that arose in connection with the spin off on september  interest expense was significantly higher in since the related borrowings were outstanding for the full year compared to three months during derivative losses gains  net derivative losses gains  net for the years ended december  and relate primarily to the portion of the change in fair value of foreign currency accounting hedges that is excluded from the measurement of effectiveness  which includes a differences between changes in forward rates and spot rates  and b gains or losses on the contract and any offsetting positions during periods in which the instrument is not designated as a hedge 
although the majority of changes in the value of our hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss until settlement ie spot rate changes  the remaining portion of changes in value are recognized in income as they occur 
the significant volatility in the fluctuation in foreign currency forward rates compared to spot rates primarily related to the euro has resulted in charges of million in the year ended december  compared to gains of million in prior to september   we did not have any forward contracts that qualified as hedges  and therefore the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts were reflected within this line item in the consolidated statements of income prior to that date 
our foreign currency forward contracts that did not qualify as hedges under applicable derivative accounting rules were held primarily in the euro and british pound and had maturities of one year or less 
since these instruments did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  there was resulting volatility in our net income for the periods presented prior to september  on september   we established our foreign currency forward positions to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting 
foreign exchange effect on notes receivable from first data  net all euro denominated notes receivable with first data  and related foreign currency swap agreements were settled in connection with the spin off on september  accordingly  no amounts related to the revaluation of such notes or related swaps were recorded during the years ended december  and  explaining the decrease from the year ended december  no such amounts will be recognized in future periods 
prior to the spin off  the revaluation to fair market value of these euro denominated notes receivable from first data and the related foreign currency swap arrangements benefited income before income taxes for the year ended december  by million due to changes in the value of the euro compared to the united states dollar 
interest income from first data  net interest income from first data  net consists of interest income earned on notes receivable from first data  partially offset by interest incurred on notes payable to first data 
all notes receivable and payable were settled in connection with the spin off on september   and accordingly  no such amounts were recognized during the years ended december  and other income  net changes in other income  net during the years ended december  and compared to the previous corresponding years were primarily attributable to fluctuations in equity earnings from equity method investments 
income taxes our effective tax rates on pretax income were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we continue to benefit from an increasing proportion of profits being 
table of contents foreign derived and therefore taxed at lower rates than our combined federal and state tax rates in the united states 
in addition  the decreasing effective tax rate in compared to is also attributed to the implementation of foreign tax efficient strategies consistent with our overall tax planning and the favorable resolution of certain united states tax matters 
we have established contingency reserves for material  known tax exposures  including potential tax audit adjustments with respect to our international operations restructured in  whereby our income from certain foreign to foreign money transfer transactions has been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rates in the united states 
as of december   the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits is a liability of million  including accrued interest and penalties 
our reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review 
while we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks  there can be no assurance that  in all instances  an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve 
with respect to these reserves  our income tax expense would include i any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in facts and circumstances ie new information surrounding a tax issue  and ii any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period 
such resolution could materially increase or decrease income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in future periods 
the united states internal revenue service irs completed its examination of the united states federal consolidated income tax returns of first data for and  of which we are a part  and issued a notice of deficiency in december the notice of deficiency alleges significant additional taxes  interest and penalties owed with respect to a variety of adjustments involving us and our subsidiaries  and we generally have responsibility for taxes associated with these potential western union related adjustments under the tax allocation agreement with first data executed at the time of the spin off 
we agree with a number of the adjustments in the notice of deficiency  however  we do not agree with the notice of deficiency regarding several substantial adjustments representing total alleged additional tax and penalties due of approximately million 
as of december   interest on the alleged amounts due for unagreed adjustments would be approximately million 
a substantial part of the alleged amounts due for these unagreed adjustments relates to our international restructuring  which took effect in the fourth quarter  and  accordingly  the alleged amounts due related to such restructuring largely are attributable to we expect to contest those adjustments with which we do not agree with by filing a petition in the united states tax court 
we believe our overall reserves are adequate  including those associated with adjustments alleged in the notice of deficiency 
if the irs position in the notice of deficiency is sustained  our tax provision related to and later years would materially increase 
earnings per share during the years ended december   and  basic earnings per share were  and  respectively  and diluted earnings per share were  and  respectively 
all issued and outstanding shares of western union common stock until the spin off on september   consisting of shares  were held by first data

the lower number of diluted shares outstanding was driven by stock repurchases exceeding stock option exercises in compared to diluted earnings per share decreased during the year ended december  compared to the previous period due to the decrease in net income as a result of the previously described factors and the increase in diluted shares outstanding

revenues overview compared to the primary drivers of consumer to consumer revenue growth are transaction fees and foreign exchange revenue 
consumer to consumer money transfer revenue growth was for the year ended december  over the same period in this increase was driven by revenue growth of in our international business on transaction growth of 
our international business represents all transactions other than transactions between and within the united states and canada and transactions to and from mexico 
our international consumer to consumer business outside of the united states also continued to experience strong revenue growth for the year ended december  as a result of strong transaction growth 
however  during the fourth quarter of  revenue was impacted by the weakening global economy and its effect on western union customers 
in the fourth quarter  transaction growth rates slowed sequentially compared to the first nine months of in addition  the amount of money remitted per transaction declined in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of these factors resulted in less transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of revenue growth in our emeasa region was on transaction growth of for the year ended december  over the same period in the growth in our emeasa region during the year ended december   was primarily driven by transaction growth and the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues into the united states dollar  specifically the euro  as further described below 
contributing to the growth in the emeasa region was strong transaction growth of over in our money transfer business to india for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in  resulting in revenue growth of over 
over the same period  revenue growth in the gulf states continued to be strong 
however  revenue growth in some european markets during the year ended december  slowed over the previous year  especially during the fourth quarter of as certain countries within europe  such as spain  have experienced declines in the housing industry and rising unemployment 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and currencies other than the united states dollar for the year ended december  have resulted in a benefit to transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue of million  over the previous year  net of foreign currency hedges  that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates 
the positive impact to operating profit derived from foreign currency exchange rates increasing against the united states dollar during the year was offset by the impact of foreign currency derivative losses for those foreign currency derivatives not designated as hedges and the portion of fair value that is excluded from the measure of effectiveness for these contracts designated as hedges thereby resulting in a minimal impact to overall earnings per share 
transactions in the euro  which represent the majority of the company s foreign currency denominated business  benefited revenue by million and operating income by million during the year 
if exchange rates between the united states dollar and other currencies remain constant with those experienced at the end of  or if the euro and certain other currencies continue to weaken against the united states dollar  we expect a negative impact on our revenue in however  the impact to earnings per share is expected to be less due to the impact of translation on our expenses and our hedging program 

table of contents americas revenue declined for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in but transactions grew for the same period 
the united states domestic and the united states outbound revenue continued to decline  due to the overall weakening in the united states economy and rising unemployment  for the year ended december  within the americas region  revenue declines in our domestic transactions between and within the united states and canada business  which represents approximately of consolidated revenue for the year ended december   continued to occur due to the factors described above 
although the domestic and united states outbound revenue declines experienced in have moderated compared to those experienced in  we did experience increased revenue declines in the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of  due to the further weakening in the united states economy 
domestic revenue declined on transaction declines of for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in in addition  united states telephone money transfer revenues continued to decline  and website money transfer revenues were flat for the year ended december  revenue in our mexico business was down on transaction declines of for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the mexico business continues to be impacted by the weakening in the united states economy  noted earlier  with such declines increasing in the fourth quarter of during a few weeks in the fourth quarter  the value of the mexican peso decreased dramatically against the united states dollar and  as a result  we experienced a spike in transactions as united states senders took advantage of the more favorable exchange rates 
as the devaluation of the peso was sudden and unusual  we needed to acquire pesos at less favorable rates in order to meet the demand for immediate payout in mexico  which impacted the overall decline in revenue by less than million 
in early july  the arizona court of appeals overturned a trial court s ruling in western union s favor regarding the authority of the arizona attorney general to seize money transfers originated in states other than arizona and intended for payment in mexico 
in december  the arizona supreme court agreed to hear the case  which was argued on january  however  a decision has not yet been rendered 
the arizona attorney general has not attempted to resume the type of seizures that are at issue in this litigation 
however  we remain subject to scrutiny in arizona by law enforcement and regulatory agencies 
the arizona attorney general has and continues to make extensive data requests of us regarding our operations  our agents and our consumers 
on january   the arizona superior court ruled in western union s favor and held that certain subpoenas for western union transaction data issued by the arizona attorney general were over broad and unenforceable 
however  the legal and regulatory environment in arizona remains challenging  and we could become subject to additional civil and possibly criminal actions 
to date  we have not experienced any measurable impact to our americas business as a result of the recent arizona court of appeals decision or the data requests by the arizona attorney general 
however  additional civil or criminal actions or an unfavorable resolution of the case described above could adversely affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
revenue and transaction growth in the apac region for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was driven by strong inbound growth to the region  especially to the philippines 
china revenue and transactions grew at and for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in  respectively 
revenue growth rates slowed to china during the third quarter of  with revenue declining in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in  in part due to the weakening economic situation described previously and the decline in high revenue transactions from small entrepreneurs that typically make purchases in china 
foreign exchange revenue increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase in cross currency transactions primarily as a result of growth in international consumer to consumer transactions 
as described above  foreign exchange revenue also benefited during the year ended december  compared to from the exchange rate between other currencies against the united states dollar  despite the negative impact of currency rate fluctuations in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents we have historically implemented and will likely implement future strategic fee reductions and actions to reduce foreign exchange spreads  where appropriate  taking into account growth opportunities and competitive factors 
fee decreases and foreign exchange actions generally reduce margins  but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time 
during the year ended december   fee decreases and foreign exchange actions have occurred at a significantly lower rate than in previous years 
such fee decreases and foreign exchange actions have impacted our annual consolidated revenue on average approximately during and and approximately in contributing to the increase in total consumer to consumer money transfer revenue and transaction growth in all periods presented was the growth in transactions at existing agent locations  the increased number of agent locations and marketing campaigns promoting the western union brand and services 
the majority of transaction growth is derived from more mature agent locations  new agent locations typically contribute only marginally to revenue growth in the first few years of their operation 
increased productivity  measured by transactions per location  is often experienced as locations mature 
we believe that new agent locations will help drive growth by increasing the number of locations available to send and receive money 
we generally refer to locations with more than of transactions being initiated versus paid as send locations and to the balance of locations as receive locations 
send locations are the engine that drives consumer to consumer revenue 
they contribute more transactions per location than receive locations 
however  a wide network of receive locations is necessary to build each corridor and to help ensure global distribution and convenience for consumers to generate transactions 
the number of send and receive transactions at an agent location can vary significantly due to such factors as customer demographics around the location  immigration patterns  the location s class of trade  hours of operation  length of time the location has been offering our services  regulatory limitations and competition 
each of the more than  agent locations in our agent network is capable of providing one or more of our services  however  not every location completes a transaction in a given period 
for example  as of december   more than of agent locations in the united states  canada and western europe representing at least one of our three money transfer brands experienced money transfer activity in the previous months 
in the developing regions of asia and other areas where there are primarily receive locations  approximately of locations experienced money transfer activity in the previous months 
we periodically review locations to determine whether they remain enabled to perform money transfer transactions 
compared to consumer to consumer money transfer revenue growth was for the year ended december  over this increase was driven by revenue growth of in our international business on transaction growth of 
our international consumer to consumer business outside of the united states also continued to experience strong revenue growth for the year ended december  as a result of strong transaction growth 
revenue growth in our emeasa region was on transaction growth of for the year ended december  over the same period in the growth in our emeasa region during the year ended december   was primarily driven by transaction growth and the impact of the euro  as further described below 
contributing to the growth in the emeasa region was strong transaction growth of in our money transfer business to india for the year ended december   resulting in revenue growth of for the year ended december  in addition  fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the united states dollar have resulted in a benefit to consumer to consumer transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue of million for the year ended december  over  that would not have occurred had there been a constant exchange rate

americas revenue declined for the year ended december  but transactions grew for the same period 
the united states to mexico  united states domestic and the united states outbound revenue were adversely impacted by various factors in the united states for the year ended december  these factors  
table of contents which began in the second quarter  include the immigration debate and market softness  in part due to the slowdown in the construction industry 
we responded to these factors by launching distribution  pricing  advertising  promotion and community outreach initiatives 
within the americas region  revenue declines in our domestic business  which represents approximately of consolidated revenue for the year ended december   continued to occur due to the factors described above 
domestic revenue declined on transaction declines of for the year ended december  over the same period in domestic revenue declined at a higher rate than transactions  due in part to the impact of price decreases and lower principal amounts sent 
in addition  transactions and revenues for money transfers initiated on our website and through the telephone declined for the year ended december  compared to the same period in transactions initiated in the united states were impacted by tightened controls implemented beginning in early by western union  card issuing banks and card associations in response to credit and debit card fraud in the united states 
these tightened controls have directly impacted our consumers ability to use their debit and credit cards to send money on our website and through the telephone  decreasing the volume of transactions 
card issuing banks and card associations have begun to allow more consumer transactions to be processed  in part in response to western union s own increased scrutiny of these transactions 
revenue in our mexico business  which represented of consolidated revenue for the year ended december   declined for the year ended december  compared to  despite increased transaction growth of for the same period due to price reductions taken in the early part of however  mexico revenue and transaction growth rates began to converge during each sequential quarter in as there were no significant pricing reductions after the early part of revenue and transaction growth in the apac region for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was driven by strong inbound growth to the region  especially to the philippines

operating income during the year ended december  was adversely impacted by incremental public company expenses which are incremental to both costs allocated by first data prior to the spin off and presumed overhead allocations from first data had we remained part of first data 
such incremental public company expenses include salaries  benefits  equipment  supplies and other costs incurred in connection with operating as a separate public company

the consumer to business segment  including the united states electronic based bill payments business which experienced flat revenues year over year  was adversely impacted in the last half of due to the weakening economy in the united states 
some consumers who are likely to use our services are having difficulty paying their bills and are unable to obtain credit in any form  resulting in us handling fewer bill payments

first data  through its subsidiary integrated payment systems inc ips  issues our western union branded money orders  pursuant to a five year agreement that was executed in conjunction with the spin off 
on july   we entered into an agreement with ips which modified the existing business relationship with respect to the issuance and processing of money orders 
under the terms of that agreement beginning on october  the transition date  ips will assign and transfer to us certain operating assets used by ips to 
table of contents issue money orders and an amount of cash sufficient to satisfy all outstanding money order liabilities 
on the transition date  we will assume ips s role as issuer of the money orders  including its obligation to pay outstanding money orders and will terminate the existing agreement whereby ips pays us a fixed return on the outstanding money order balances which vary from day to day but approximate million 
following the transition date  we will invest the cash received from ips in high quality  investment grade securities in accordance with applicable regulations  which are the same as those currently governing the investment of our united states originated money transfer principal 
in anticipation of our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  we have entered into interest rate swaps on certain of our fixed rate notes 
through a combination of the revenue generated from these investment securities and the anticipated interest expense savings resulting from these interest rate swaps  we estimate that we should be able to retain subsequent to the transition date  on a pre tax income basis through  a comparable rate of return as we are receiving under our current agreement with ips 
however  revenue may be lower 
subsequent to the transition date  all revenue generated from the management of the investment portfolio will be retained by us and none will be shared with our agents 
ips will continue to provide to us clearing services necessary for payment of the money orders in exchange for the payment by us to ips of a per item administrative fee

further financial information relating to each of our segments external revenue  operating profit measures and total assets is set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements 
capital resources and liquidity our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from our operating activities  derived primarily from net income  and fluctuations in working capital 
our working capital is affected by the timing of interest payments on our outstanding borrowings  timing of income tax payments  and collections on receivables  among other items 
the majority of our interest payments are due in the second and fourth quarters which results in a decrease in the amount of cash provided by operating activities in those quarters  and a corresponding increase to the first and third quarters 

table of contents our future cash flows generated from operating activities could be impacted by a variety of factors  some of which are out of our control  including changes in economic conditions  especially those impacting the migrant population  and changes in income tax laws or the status of income tax audits 
a significant portion of our cash flows from operating activities has been generated from subsidiaries  some of which are regulated entities 
these subsidiaries may transfer all excess cash to the parent company for general corporate use  except for assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions 
such assets include those located in countries outside of the united states containing restrictions from being transferred outside of those countries and cash and investment balances that are maintained by our regulated subsidiary to secure certain money transfer obligations initiated in the united states in accordance with applicable state regulations in the united states 
significant changes in the regulatory environment for money transmitters could impact our primary source of liquidity 
on december   we entered into a senior  unsecured  day term loan in an aggregate principal amount of million the term loan with a syndicate of lenders 
the term loan was used for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of commercial paper utilized to retire million of floating rate notes that came due on november  as market conditions allow  we intend to refinance our term loan in with new financing sources 
based on market conditions at the time such re financing occurs  we may not be able to obtain new financing under similar conditions as historically reported 
taking into account our projected share repurchases  dividends  our pending acquisition  capital expenditures  and debt service during  we believe our cash flows generated from operating activities and available financing sources will provide us with an adequate source of liquidity to meet the needs of our business 
cash and investment securities as of december   we have cash and cash equivalents of billion 
our foreign entities held million of our cash and cash equivalents at december  our ongoing cash management strategies to fund our business needs could cause united states and foreign cash balances to fluctuate 
repatriating foreign funds to the united states would  in many cases  result in significant tax obligations because most of these funds have been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rate in the united states 
we expect to use foreign funds to expand and fund our international operations and to acquire businesses internationally 
on september   we requested redemption of our shares in the reserve international liquidity fund  ltd 
the fund  a money market fund  totaling million 
we did not receive any portion of the redemption payment prior to december   and accordingly  we have reclassified the total amount due from cash and cash equivalents to other assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  this surplus cash was not required or used for daily operations 
at the time the redemption request was made  we were informed by the reserve management company  the fund s investment advisor the manager  that our redemption trades would be honored at a per share net asset value 
on january   we received a partial distribution from the fund of million 
we expect to receive the remaining redemption amount based on written and verbal representations from the manager to date and our current legal position regarding our redemption priority 
we expect to receive the remaining payment based on the maturities of the underlying investments in the fund and the outcome of the litigation process 
there is a risk the redemption process could be delayed and that we could receive less than the per share net asset value  should a pro rata distribution occur 
based on net asset information provided by the fund  our exposure related to pro rata distribution could be million  excluding settlement costs incurred by the fund 
we believe that  despite this situation  we have adequate liquidity to meet our business needs through our existing cash balances  our ability to generate cash flows through operations  and the amounts available to borrow under our commercial paper program and our revolving credit facility  as described under financing resources below 

table of contents in many cases  we receive funds from money transfers and certain other payment services before we settle the payment of those transactions 
these funds  referred to as settlement assets on our consolidated balance sheets  are not used to support our operations 
however  we earn income from investing these funds

a portion of our settlement assets are held in investment securities  substantially all of which are highly rated state and municipal debt instruments  totaling million as of december  most state regulators in the united states require us to maintain specific high quality  investment grade securities and such investments are intended to secure relevant outstanding settlement obligations in accordance with applicable regulations 
we do not hold financial instruments for trading purposes  and all of our investment securities are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value 
investment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk 
we regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by making high quality investments 
as of december   the significant majority of our investment securities had credit ratings of aa or better from a major credit rating agency 
our investment securities are also actively managed with respect to concentration 
as of december   there were no investments with a single issuer or individual securities representing more than of our investment securities portfolio 
ips  our third party issuer of western union money orders  holds the settlement assets generated from the sale of money orders  and maintains the responsibility for investing those funds 
based on the terms of the agreement with ips  we are provided with a fixed rate of return on the funds awaiting settlement 
in connection with the july  agreement we entered into with ips  on october  we will assume the responsibility for the settlement of money orders and will have responsibility for managing the investment portfolio 
on the same date  we will receive an amount of cash sufficient to satisfy all outstanding money order liabilities  which vary from day to day but approximate million

cash flows from operating activities during the years ended december  and  cash provided by operating activities was  million and  million  respectively

credit ratings and debt covenants the credit ratings on our debt are an important consideration in managing our financing costs and facilitating access to additional capital on favorable terms 
factors that we believe are important in assessing our credit ratings include earnings  cash flow generation  leverage  available liquidity and overall business risks 
our revolving credit facility contains a facility fee and a utilization fee  and our term loan contains a loan fee and an application margin  all of which is determined based on our credit rating assigned by s p and or moody s  as further described above 
we do not have any other terms within our debt agreements or other contracts that are tied to changes in our credit ratings

table of contents these ratings are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold any of our securities 
our credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
we cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances so warrant 
a downgrade or a negative outlook provided by the rating agencies could result in the following our access to the commercial paper market may be limited  and if we were downgraded below investment grade  our access to the commercial paper market would likely be eliminated  our borrowing costs on certain existing borrowings would increase  we may be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings  our potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease  regulators may impose additional capital and other requirements on us  including imposing restrictions on the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends  and our agent relationships may be adversely impacted  particularly those agents that are financial institutions or post offices

prior to december  we held a interest in pago f cil  which was treated as an equity method investment 
as a result of acquiring the additional ownership  our entire investment in and results of operations of pago f cil have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date 
we expect that we will continue to pursue opportunities to acquire companies  particularly outside of the united states  that complement our existing businesses worldwide 
share repurchases and dividends since september  the board of directors has authorized common stock repurchases of up to billion consisting of a billion authorization in june authorization  a billion authorization in december authorization and a billion authorization in september both the authorization and the authorization in have been fully utilized 
during the years ended december   and  million  million and million shares  respectively  were repurchased for  million  million and million  respectively  excluding commissions  at an average cost of  and per share  respectively

as a result  we earn a pro rata share of profits and have enhanced voting rights 
we also have the right to add additional agent relationships in singapore under this agreement

most significantly  in the first quarter  we signed a six year agreement with one of our existing agents which included a four year loan of million to the agent  of which million  million and million were repaid in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the terms of the loan agreement require that a percentage of commissions earned by the agent in be withheld as repayment of the loan and the agent remains obligated to repay the loan if commissions earned are not sufficient 
the remaining loan receivable balance relating to this agent as of december  and  net of discount  was million and million  respectively 
as opportunities arise  we expect we will continue to strategically invest in agents to further strengthen our business 
debt service requirements our debt service requirements will include the million term loan principal balance  payments on existing borrowings and any future borrowings under our commercial paper program and interest payments on all outstanding indebtedness 
we have the ability to use existing financing sources  such as our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program  to meet debt obligations as they arise 
as market conditions allow  we intend to refinance our term loan with new financing sources 
based on market conditions at the time such re financing occurs  we may not be able to obtain new financings under similar conditions as historically reported 

table of contents our ability to continue to grow the business  make acquisitions  return capital to shareholders  primarily through share repurchases  and service our debt will depend on our ability to continue to generate excess operating cash through our operating subsidiaries and to continue to receive dividends from those operating subsidiaries  our ability to obtain adequate financing and our ability to identify the appropriate acquisitions that will align with our long term strategy 
prior to spin off from first data prior to the spin off  excess cash generated from our domestic operations that was not required to meet certain regulatory requirements was periodically advanced to first data and was reflected as a receivable from first data 
in addition  we periodically paid dividends to first data 
first data and its subsidiaries provided a number of services on behalf of our business  including shared services  which were reimbursed periodically 
also  when we were a segment of first data  we benefited from first data s financing resources 
off balance sheet arrangements other than facility and equipment leasing arrangements disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have no material off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
pension plans we have two frozen defined benefit plans that together had a recorded unfunded pension obligation of million as of december  during the period from to  we did not make contributions to these plans 
due to the impact of recent legislation enacted  we will not be required to contribute to these plans during  but estimate we will be required to fund approximately to million in our most recent measurement date for our pension plans is december  the calculation of the funded status and net periodic benefit income is dependent upon two primary assumptions expected long term return on plan assets  and discount rate 
our expected long term return on plan assets was for and if actual asset returns exceed the expected return on plan assets by basis points  the plans funded status would improve by million 
the discount rate assumption for the company s benefit obligation was and for and  respectively 
a basis point change in the discount rate would change the funded status by million 
due to the frozen status of our plans  a basis point change in these assumptions would not be significant to the net periodic benefit income or expense of our plans 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties as of december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years borrowings  including interest a purchase obligations b foreign currency forward contracts c operating leases unrecognized tax benefits d capitalized contract costs e estimated pension funding f a we have estimated our interest payments based on i projected libor rates in calculating interest on commercial paper borrowings and our term loan  ii projected commercial paper borrowings outstanding throughout  and the assumption that no such amounts will be outstanding beyond  and iii the assumption that no debt issuances or renewals will occur upon the maturity dates of our fixed notes and term loan 
our term loan matures in december and we plan to refinance this facility in with new financing sources 
b many of our contracts contain clauses that allow us to terminate the contract with notice  and with or without a termination penalty 
termination penalties are generally an amount less than the original obligation 
certain contracts also have an automatic renewal clause if we do not provide written notification of our intent to terminate the contract 
obligations under certain contracts are usage based and are  therefore  estimated in the above amounts 
historically  we have not had any significant defaults of our contractual obligations or incurred significant penalties for termination of our contractual obligations 
c represents the liability position of our foreign currency forward contracts as of december   which will fluctuate based on market conditions 
d the timing of cash payments on unrecognized tax benefits  including accrued interest and penalties  is inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount and timing of such liabilities is affected by factors which are variable and outside our control 
e represents accrued and unpaid initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts as of december  f we have estimated our pension plan funding requirements  including interest  using assumptions that are consistent with current pension funding rates 
the actual minimum required amounts each year will vary based on the actual discount rate and asset returns when the funding requirement is calculated 
other commercial commitments we had million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees at december   with expiration dates through  certain of which contain a one year renewal option 
the letters of credit and bank guarantees are primarily held in connection with lease arrangements and certain agent agreements 
we expect to renew the letters of credit and bank guarantees prior to expiration in most circumstances
