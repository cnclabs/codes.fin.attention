item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts are in thousands except per share amounts and where noted 
the following comments should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements 
productivity of assets and working capital 
a assets 
year end total assets were  compared to  in the decrease was due primarily to a  decrease in cash and investments 
in  utmd used its cash to repurchase  of its shares for  and pay  in dividends to shareholders as a result  the productivity of total assets average total asset turns  total sales divided by average total assets for the year was about higher than in in both years productivity was diluted by utmd s substantial cash equivalent balances 
year end and cash and investment balances were  and  representing and of total assets  respectively 
utmd also used its cash generated in ireland in to reduce the principle on the ireland loan by  excluding average cash and investment balances  average total asset turns were in both and in  total assets excluding cash and investment balances will continue to be substantially less than annual sales  which benefits return on average shareholders equity roe 
other asset changes which aided the decline in total assets included a decrease in the net book value of property and equipment due to depreciation  and a decrease in receivables due to lower sales and better a r collections performance 
property  plant and equipment pp e assets are comprised of utah  oregon and ireland manufacturing molds  production tooling and equipment  test equipment  computer communications equipment and software  and the utah and ireland facilities 
utmd leases the oregon facility as a result of the cmi acquisition  and a portion of its midvale  utah parking lot 
in  net consolidated pp e depreciated book value of all fixed assets decreased as a result of in depreciation  capital expenditures of and the effect of currency exchange rates on equipment in ireland 
the net book value of pp e in the us decreased  and in ireland decreased the year end net book value after accumulated depreciation of consolidated pp e was of actual acquisition cost 
since utmd s pp e is in good working order and capable of supporting increased sales activity  the continued productivity of fixed assets will remain a source of future profitability 
in  depreciation of fixed assets should again equal or exceed new pp e purchases required to sustain current operations 
average inventory turns were despite lower sales  and continued to meet management s objective 
net after allowance for doubtful accounts year end trade accounts receivable a r balances decreased or about while sales activity decreased 
the resulting average days in a r on december  of days  based on q shipments  improved from days at the end of this performance remained well within management s continuing objective of days 
a r over days from invoice date at year end were of total a r  down significantly from at the end of the company believes the older a r will be collected or are within its reserve balances for uncollectible accounts 
working capital at year end was  compared to  at year end both of those amounts exceed utmd s working capital needs for internally financing growth in normal operations 
utmd s current ratio current assets divided current liabilities increased to from due to a  decline in the denominator 
accrued liabilities  a subset of current liabilities c l  declined  because of lower accrued management bonuses and the fact that in the q shareholder dividend was paid at the end of december instead of early january  as in prior years 
the current portion of the ireland note  which is also included in c l  declined by utmd expects to be able to maintain a very healthy current ratio in net after accumulated amortization intangible assets  which are comprised of goodwill resulting from acquisitions and the costs of obtaining patents and other intellectual property including technology rights  were  at the end of compared to  at the end of utmd s goodwill balance is  under current gaap  goodwill is not expensed unless and until the market value of the acquired entity becomes impaired 
the three acquisitions of  and continue to be viable parts of utmd s overall business  representing of total sales in utmd does not expect the current intangible value of goodwill associated with the acquisitions to become impaired in purchases of other intangibles of in were offset by in amortization expense 
net intangible assets at the end of represented of total assets compared to at the end of b liabilities 
in  utmd s total liabilities decreased  from the end of the resulting ending total debt ratio was of total assets  down from a total debt ratio of at the end of current liabilities declined primarily because of the decrease in accrued expenses and the current portion of the ireland loan  as noted above 
the ireland note payable as a whole  denominated in euros  declined  in usd book value compared to actual principal payments of  the difference results from currency exchange in the value of the usd compared to the euro 
in thousand euro  the note declined from  at the beginning of to  at the end of as a reminder to shareholders  the note was initiated in december to finance repatriation of profits achieved in ireland since through under the american jobs creation act of utmd ltd 
plans to repay this note from profits generated in ireland over the next two to three years 
in addition to liabilities on the balance sheet  utmd has operating lease and purchase obligations described in note results of operations 
a revenues 
global consolidated sales in were  compared to  in and  in domestic sales were  in  compared to  in and  in utmd divides its domestic sales into two distribution channels direct sales which are sales to end user customers by utmd s direct sales force  independent commissioned sales reps  specialty distributors and national hospital distribution companies  and oem sales which are component sales to other companies where products are packaged and resold as part of another company s finished product offerings 
as a percentage of total domestic sales  direct domestic sales were in  and in both and therefore  domestic oem sales were of total domestic sales in  and of sales in both and domestic direct sales represented of global consolidated sales in  compared to in and in international foreign sales in were  compared to  in and  in international sales grew to of global consolidated sales in  compared to in and in of the international sales  were to customers in europe compared to in and in ireland operations utmd ltd 
shipped of international sales in usd terms in  compared to in and in utmd ltd 
trade shipments were down in euro terms  and down in usd terms  in compared to utmd groups its sales into four general product categories obstetrics  comprised of labor and delivery management tools for monitoring fetal and maternal well being  for reducing risk in performing difficult delivery procedures and for improving clinician and patient safety  gynecology electrosurgery urology  comprised of tools for gynecological procedures associated primarily with cervical uterine disease including letz  endometrial sampling  transvaginal uterine sonography  diagnostic laparoscopy  and other mis procedures  specialty excision and incision tools  conservative urinary incontinence therapy devices  and urology tools  neonatal critical care  comprised of devices that provide developmentally friendly care to the most critically ill babies  including providing vascular access  enteral feeding  administering vital fluids  maintaining a neutral thermal environment  providing protection and assisting in specialized applications  and blood pressure monitoring accessories other  comprised of specialized components as well as molded parts sold on an oem basis to other companies 
in these four categories  utmd s primary revenue contributors enjoy a significant market share and may have differentiated product features protected by patents 
global revenues by product category obstetrics gynecology electrosurgery urology neonatal blood pressure monitoring and accessories total includes molded components sold to oem customers 
international revenues by product category obstetrics gynecology electrosurgery urology neonatal blood pressure monitoring and accessories total includes molded components sold to oem customers 
as a summary explanation of revenues in the above tables  obstetrics 
the  decline in total obstetrics l d device sales in was primarily the result of the restrictive effects of us gpo administrative agreements 
for example  gpo restrictions included a sole source contract consummated by healthtrust purchasing group hpg with a utmd competitor for iupcs and vads which took effect on september  these specialty catheters and surgical tools are clearly in the category of clinician preference products 
the hpg sole source agreement violates the mandate by the us senate judiciary antitrust subcommittee in april that gpos only allow multi source contracting for clinician preference products  as well as the ensuing healthcare group purchasing industry initiative code of ethics  of which hpg was a founding member 
it also represented a violation of hpg s own code of ethics  which states in section hpg  no gpo should come between hospital administration and their physicians when it comes to the choice of medical devices needed to treat the patient 
to this end  healthtrust offers a complete line of contracts in these areas 
clinician preference products 
that provides substantial choice to our members and their physicians 
in the us  sales of intran plus intrauterine pressure catheters iupcs declined  and sales of cmi vacuum assisted delivery systems vads declined about of the iupc decline resulted from lower prices 
the silver lining of this decline is that the company s reliance on a single product is much less concentrated  ie  in  us iupc sales were of total sales compared to when us iupc sales were of total sales 
the  decline in us iupc and vads sales but only decline in total sales indicates that utmd s sales of its other devices and its international business are expanding 
international gynecology electrosurgery urology es gyn product sales increased  while us es gyn sales declined 
as a result of the american society for colposcopy and cervical pathology asccp revised guidelines for the treatment of cin  which advised greater monitoring of lower grade lesions in lieu of surgical treatment  utmd observed approximately a decline in use of letz electrodes from a consistent gynecology customer base 
the effect of the new guidelines now seems to have stabilized 
neonatal critical care device nicu sales increased in the us and internationally 
in the us  because products in this category are sold to hospitals  sales are affected by gpo restrictions 
however  because nicu devices are more diverse and lower volume than in l d  and because of the special nature of the patients  utmd believes that clinicians remain more heavily involved in product selection 
therefore  us gpo administrative deals are less of a challenge in supplying specialty nicu devices than for l d 
utmd expects that nicu devices will lead its sales growth in blood pressure monitoring and accessories bpm 
us bpm sales increased  while international bpm sales increased 
virtually all of utmd s domestic oem sales were included in the bpm category in domestic oem sales increased compared to the category includes molded components some of which are not related to medical devices sold to other companies for use in their products 
in contrast to the other product categories  international sales of bpm devices comprise most in and in of utmd s bpm sales 
utmd s bpm sales depend heavily on successful marketing by international distributors and oems 
due to a stronger us dollar and a general economic downturn  utmd experienced substantial slowing of international distributor orders for bpm products in h  and expects that it will continue into in early  utmd learned that its largest international customer located in germany and third largest international customer located in south africa  combined representing  of international sales  would not be purchasing utmd products at least for the first quarter of looking forward to  utmd s improvement in domestic direct sales depends on its ability to obtain medical staff involvement in purchasing decisions for utmd s physician preference products used in us hospitals where administrators are making the product decisions through the use of gpos contracts awarded on bases which may not adequately take into consideration the total cost of patient care  which includes complication rates and longer term health outcomes 
an important factor in utmd s ability to compete in this administratively cumbersome environment is its continuing ability to develop devices that are clearly differentiated on the basis of patient safety and better health outcomes 
despite the apparent weakness in international sales entering the year  and excluding the possibility of acquisition of a new product line with established sales  management projects overall revenues in about the same as in this assumes continued increases in domestic nicu and es gyn sales of about and resumption of international customer purchases in q b gross profit 
utmd s gross profit  the surplus after subtracting costs of manufacturing  inspecting  packaging  sterilizing and shipping products cgs from net revenues  was  compared to  in and  in gross profit margins gpms  gross profits expressed as a percentage of net sales  were in compared to in and in the gpm in was lower for several reasons because many of utmd s manufacturing overhead expenses are fixed in order to preserve capabilities  the lower consolidated sales activity in had a higher overhead content 
utmd retains facilities and other manufacturing infrastructure well in excess of its current needs  which will help gpm when sales expand 
because of competition and a number of long term fixed pricing agreements  utmd had a limited ability to increase product prices in  at the same time direct labor and direct materials costs were increasing fairly substantially 
in  utmd reduced domestic prices of its iupcs by 
this represented of the obstetrics sales decline and of the decline in total gross profits 
management doesn t expect any significant price decreases in utmd conducted an iupc recall in due to potentially defective packaging  for which it estimates a marginal cost  after applying its warranty reserve  of about a half percentage point in total gpm 
the recall was completed successfully without any indication of a risk of patient injury  and with no interruption to the supply of iupcs needed by hospital customers 
the distribution mix helped lower the average gpm since domestic oem and international sales increased while domestic direct sales decreased 
gpms on domestic direct sales must be higher in order to support sales and marketing expenses that are not associated with domestic oem and international sales 
utmd expects gpm to again be under pressure as a result of higher direct labor  direct materials and overhead costs with about the same projected sales 
utmd utilizes oem sales as a means to help maximize utilization of its capabilities established to satisfy its direct sales business 
as a general rule  prices for oem sales expressed as a multiple of direct variable manufacturing expenses are lower than for direct sales because  in the oem and international channels  utmd s business partners incur significant expenses of sales and marketing 
because of utmd s small size and period to period fluctuations in oem business activity  allocations of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses cannot be meaningfully allocated between direct and oem sales 
therefore  utmd does not report gpm by sales channels 
c operating income 
operating income is the surplus after operating expenses are subtracted from gross profits 
operating expenses include sales and marketing s m expenses  product development r d expenses and general and administrative g a expenses 
combined operating expenses were  in  compared to  in and  in the lower operating expenses were primarily due to lower accrued management bonuses and lower gpo fees 
r d expenses s m expenses g a a litigation expense provision g a b corporate legal expenses g a c stock option compensation expense g a d management bonus accrual g a e outside accounting audit tax expenses g a f all other expenses g a expenses total total operating expenses operating income in was  compared to  in  and  in utmd s operating profit margin operating income divided by total sales was in  compared to in both and looking forward to  utmd expects an operating margin of about  as it plans to increase expenses in all three areas of s m  r d and g a with about the same volume of sales as in i s m expenses s m expenses are the costs of communicating utmd s differences and product advantages  providing training and other customer service in support of the use of utmd s solutions  attending clinical meetings and medical trade shows  processing orders and funding gpo fees 
because utmd sells internationally through third party distributors  its s m expenses are predominantly for us business activity where it sells directly to clinical users 
the largest component of s m expenses is the cost of directly employing representatives that solicit product sales and provide customer support across the us the decline in s m expenses primarily reflects fewer direct sales representatives 
as a percent of total sales  s m operating expenses were in  in and in in  utmd intends to increase s m expenses  but hold the ratio to total sales to about 
ii r d expenses r d expenses include the costs of investigating clinical needs  developing innovative concepts  testing concepts for viability  validating methods of manufacture  completing premarketing regulatory documentation and other activities required for design control  responding to customer requests for product enhancements  and assisting manufacturing engineering on an ongoing basis in developing new processes or improving existing processes 
as a percent of sales  r d expenses were in compared to in and in utmd will continue to opportunistically invest in r d in order to reinvigorate its product development pipeline 
in  r d expenses should remain in the range of of sales 
iii g a expenses g a expenses include the functional costs of executive management  finance and accounting  corporate information systems  human resources  shareholder relations  risk management  protection of intellectual property  and legal costs 
aggregate g a expenses as a percent of sales were in  in and in except for the categories of g a expenses isolated in the table above  utmd s g a expenses have remained fairly consistent over the last three years 
the following lettered items refer to the same g a subcategories in the table above a if no currently unforeseen litigation arises  utmd expects litigation expenses in to continue to decline 
b the increase in corporate legal expenses was essentially due to the legal costs associated with the filing of sec form s  registration statement under the securities act of  in q in  utmd expects a return to expenses more consistent with those in and c stock option expense in was calculated using a black scholes pricing model for unvested options 
please see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for further explanation 
in  utmd expects option expense about the same as in d the difference in management bonus compared to the two earlier years was due to the fact that utmd s ceo did not receive a management bonus 
accrued bonuses in will continue to depend both on utmd s overall performance and each individual s performance 
e utmd s personnel  fundamental business activities  internal control systems and financial reporting mechanisms have remained relatively unchanged over the last several years 
nevertheless  due to the accountants full employment act of  also known as the sarbanes oxley act of  outside auditor and tax consultant costs have grown rapidly 
still  utmd s costs remain below these expenses incurred by most companies 
management expects accounting financial controls audit costs will remain about the same as in d non operating income  non operating expense and ebt 
non operating income noi includes royalties from licensing utmd s technology  rent from leasing underutilized property to others  income earned from investing the company s excess cash and gains or losses from the sale of assets  offset by non operating expenses which include interest on the ireland bank loan  bank service fees and excise taxes 
noi was in  compared to  in and  in investment of excess cash 
investment income including gains and losses on sales in was  compared to  in and  in in  average interest rates were substantially lower and the company realized an investment loss of due just to the failure of washington mutual wm savings and loan 
utmd recognized capital gains and corporate dividends of on other common stock investments which helped offset the loss 
the wm holding represented about of utmd s investment portfolio at cost 
capital gains or losses and dividends from investments in common stocks were in  in and in the capital gains in the two earlier years allowed the loss in to be fully tax deductible 
the company also holds investments in citicorp c and general electric ge common stock which together were about below their aggregate purchase price at the end of when purchased  these holdings at cost represented less than of utmd s total investment portfolio 
unless one or both of the companies fail  as was the case with wm  utmd will not sell the holdings at current prices  expecting that they will recover in value  and therefore will not have an associated noi loss which impacts earnings 
currently  of utmd s cash investments are being held in interest bearing money market securities yielding only about 
royalties 
annual royalties received in all three years were  which came from the license of patents which expired during presently  there are no other patents under which utmd is receiving royalties from other parties 
interest expense 
in  utmd paid in interest expense on the ireland loan  compared to in and in the interest expense results from borrowing million  in december to allow the repatriation of profits generated by utmd s ireland subsidiary since through due to a lower loan balance as well as lower expected interest rates  utmd estimates that its interest expense will be less than in  resulting in about less interest cost in compared to other noi 
income received from renting underutilized warehouse space in ireland and parking lot space in utah for a cell phone tower  offset by bank fees and excise taxes  was in  in and in utmd expects other noi in will be about because of expected lack of ireland warehouse space rent in a soft economic period of time 
utmd expects total noi will be approximately that estimate does not include the possibility of a failure of citibank that would require recognition of a capital loss of approximately the estimated noi may also be lower if utmd utilizes its invested cash for an acquisition  unexpected litigation costs or substantial share repurchases 
earnings before income taxes ebt result from adding utmd s non operating income to its operating income 
ebt was  in  compared to  in and  in ebt margin is ebt divided by total sales 
utmd s ebt margin was in  in and in utmd is targeting ebt of about  in the range of of sales 
e net income  eps and roe 
net income is ebt minus income taxes  often called the bottom line 
net income was  in   in and  in the effective consolidated corporate income tax provision rate was  and respectively 
year to year fluctuations in the tax rate may result from variations in profits of the ireland subsidiary which is taxed at a rate on exported manufactured products and a rate on rental and other types of income  special us tax exclusions such as the manufacturing profit deduction  higher marginal tax rates for ebt above million  and other factors such as r d tax credits 
management expects the consolidated income tax provision rate to be closer to the and rates 
utmd s net income expressed as a percentage of sales was in  in and in utmd s profitability has consistently ranked it in the top performance tier of all us publicly traded companies  and has been a primary driver for utmd s past excellent returns on shareholders equity roe 
earnings per share eps is net income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding diluted to take into consideration stock option awards which are in the money  ie  have exercise prices below the applicable period s weighted average market value 
diluted eps were in  in and in if utmd achieves the projections above for  eps will be approximately the same as in as a result of fewer outstanding shares 
the end of weighted average number of diluted common shares the number used to calculate diluted eps were  in thousands  compared to  shares in and  shares in dilution for in the money unexercised options for the year was shares in thousands  compared to in and in the total number of options outstanding at year end declined from year end dilution decreased in from because the average number of options outstanding decreased  and because the share price in the stock market decreased  diminishing the dilutive effect of each option 
actual outstanding common shares as of december  were  return on shareholders equity roe is the portion of net income retained by utmd after payment of dividends to internally finance its growth  divided by the average accumulated shareholders equity during the applicable time period 
roe includes balance sheet measures as well as income statement measures 
roe for was excluding the fifth dividend payment which would normally have been paid in january before dividends  compared to before dividends in and before dividends in utmd s roe is primarily driven by its high net profit margin  which in declined to from in roe was also reduced by a lower debt ratio as utmd nearly cut its bank loan balance in ireland by half and had no dividend payable at year end  but was aided by higher total asset turns 
utmd s roe before dividends has averaged per year over the last years 
this ratio determines how fast the company can afford to grow without diluting shareholder interests 
for example  a roe will financially support annual growth in revenues without having to issue more stock 
looking forward  unless utmd utilizes its cash to make an acquisition or actively repurchase shares  roe will be lower than because the net profit margin is projected to be lower while financial leverage and asset utilization remain about the same 
retaining a high cash balance which returns only about dilutes overall roe 
liquidity and capital resources 
cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities  including adjustments for depreciation and other non cash operating expenses  along with changes in working capital and the tax benefit attributable to exercise of employee incentive stock options  totaled  in  compared to  in and  in compared to  net cash provided by operating activities in was higher due to a smaller decrease in gain on investments which occurred largely because the wm capital loss was recognized in net income and a larger decrease in accounts receivable  among other changes that were generally consistent with excellent balance sheet management in the presence of lower sales activity 
accelerating into december the payment of the cash dividend that normally would have been paid in january resulted in less cash provided by operating activities in the company s use of cash for investing activities was primarily as a result of purchases of liquid investments  in an effort to maximize returns on excess cash balances while maintaining safety and liquidity 
utmd expended  in on such purchases  compared to  in and  in in  utmd received  from selling short term investments  compared to  in and  in no acquisitions requiring investment of cash were made in any of the three years 
in  utmd received and issued  shares of stock upon the exercise of employee stock options 
employees exercised a total of  option shares in  with  shares immediately being retired as a result of some optionees trading the shares in payment of the exercise price of the options 
the company received a tax benefit from option exercises in utmd repurchased  shares of stock in the open market at a cost of  during option exercises in were at an average price of per share 
share repurchases in the open market were at an average cost of per share  including commissions and fees 
in comparison  in utmd received from issuing  shares of stock on the exercise of employee stock options  including  shares retired upon optionees trading those shares in payment of the stock option exercise price 
in  the company received from issuing  shares of stock on the exercise of employee and director stock options  including  shares retired upon employees and directors trading those shares in payment of the stock option exercise price and related tax withholding subject to statutory limitations 
utmd paid  in to meet tax withholding requirements on options exercised  but received a  tax benefit from those exercises 
utmd did not borrow during  or in december  utmd s foreign subsidiary borrowed million  to allow repatriation from ireland to the us of profits achieved since  per the american jobs creation act of during  the bank of ireland loan terms were modified to no longer require a guarantee by utmd s line of credit with us bank 
the us bank line of credit terminated on may  in  utmd made repayments of  on the ireland note  compared to  in and  in management believes that future income from operations and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to finance internal growth plans 
planned capital expenditures are expected to be less than to keep facilities  equipment and tooling in good working order 
in addition  utmd may use cash in for selective infusions of technological  marketing or product manufacturing rights to broaden the company s product offerings  for continued share repurchases when the price of the stock is undervalued  and if available for a reasonable price  acquisitions that may strategically fit utmd s business and are accretive to performance 
in summary  management plans to utilize cash not needed to support normal operations in one or a combination of the following to make investments in new technology and or processes  to acquire a product line that will augment revenue growth and better utilize utmd s existing infrastructure  and or to repurchase utmd shares in the open marketplace 
management s outlook 
in summary  in utmd plans to work to retain its significant global market shares of established key specialty products  accelerate revenue growth of newer products  develop additional proprietary products helpful to clinicians through internal new product development  continue achieving excellent overall financial operating performance  look for new acquisitions to augment sales growth  and utilize current cash balances in shareholders best long term interest  including continued cash dividends and open market share repurchases 
the safety  reliability and performance of utmd s products are high and represent significant clinical benefits while providing minimum total cost of care 
in the us  utmd will continue to leverage its reputation as an innovator which will responsively take on challenges to work with physicians who use its products in specialty hospital areas  or outside the hospital in their office practices 
internationally  where utmd must depend on the knowledge  focus  relationships and energy of independent distributors  management will continue to closely monitor performance and recruit needed business partners 
utmd will continue to focus on differentiating itself  especially from commodity oriented competitors 
utmd is small  but its employees are experienced and diligent in their work 
utmd s passion is in providing innovative clinical solutions that will help reduce health risks for women and their babies 
the company has a fundamental focus to do an excellent job in meeting customers and patients needs  while providing shareholders with excellent returns 
despite the decline in eps and share price over the last two years  looking back eight years to the end of  utmd s eps have more than doubled and the resulting year ending share price has almost tripled 
combining this performance with steadily growing dividends since  longer term utmd shareholders have experienced excellent returns 
in comparison  the nasdaq composite  s p index and djia indices declined  and  respectively  over that same eight year time span 
in  while the year ending share price decreased largely in q  utmd increased dividends share actually paid not counting the dividend paid in late december that would normally have been paid in january to shareholders by from 
in to 
in  and decreased shares outstanding at the end of the year by 
this was accomplished in by utmd continuing to achieve a high positive cash flow 
utmd s balance sheet is strong enough to be able to finance a substantial acquisition in without issuing stock  should an immediately accretive one become available 
in  utmd also filed an s shelf registration statement that gives it speed and flexibility in obtaining additional financing should an acquisition that exceeds current cash availability become available 
in considering acquisitions  utmd looks to acquire successful companies  products or technologies that will enhance its specialist focus  but not significantly increase its business risk and not dilute its financial performance 
off balance sheet arrangements none contractual obligations the following is a summary of utmd s significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  contractual obligations and commitments total and thereafter long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
management has identified the following as the company s most critical accounting policies which require significant judgment and estimates 
although management believes its estimates are reasonable  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts the majority of the company s receivables are with hospitals and medical device distributors 
although the company has historically not had significant write offs of bad debt  the possibility exists  particularly with foreign customers where collection efforts can be difficult or in the event of widespread us hospital bankruptcies 
inventory valuation reserves the company strives to maintain a good balance of inventory to meets its customer s needs while not tying up an unnecessary amount of the company s resources increasing the possibility of  among other things  obsolescence 
the company believes its method of reviewing actual and projected demand for its existing inventory allows it to arrive at a fair inventory valuation reserve 
while the company has historically not had significant inventory write offs  the possibility exists that one or more of its products may become unexpectedly obsolete for which a reserve has not previously been created 
the company s historical write offs have not been materially different from its estimates

this statement clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
the company or one of its subsidiaries files or has filed income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  in various states and in ireland 
with few exceptions  utmd is no longer subject to us federal  state and local  or non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before in  the internal revenue service examined the company s federal income tax returns for and suggested one immaterial adjustment which the company made 
the company s income tax return for is presently being audited by the irs 
the company adopted the provisions of fin on january  utmd did not make any adjustment to opening retained earnings as a result of the implementation 
the company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expenses and any related penalties in income taxes
