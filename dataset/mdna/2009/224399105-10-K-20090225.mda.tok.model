restructuring activities recent disruptions in the credit markets and concerns about global economic growth for industrial businesses have had a significant adverse impact on financial markets and  to an extent  our operating results in for example  our engineered materials business segment experienced significant declines in operating profit when compared to this decline reflected substantially lower sales to our traditional recreational vehicle customers  driven largely by the inability of consumers to obtain financing for rv purchases 
similarly  declining vending machine demand resulting from depressed conditions in the north american vending market has put pressure on our operating margins within our merchandising systems segment 
in our fluid handling segment  sales were adversely impacted during the second half of by slowing orders from short cycle north american businesses where we generally deliver product within days after order receipt and delays of several large valve projects into in order to align our cost base to current market conditions  during the fourth quarter of  we initiated a broad based restructuring program that included facility consolidations  severance and other related costs the restructuring program  resulting in a pre tax charge of million

for additional segment level information related to restructuring activities  you should refer to the information set forth under the caption  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii  item of this report  as well as in part ii  item under note  restructuring to the consolidated financial statements 
competitive conditions our lines of business are conducted under highly competitive conditions in each of the geographic and product areas they serve 
because of the diversity of the classes of products manufactured and sold  they do not compete with the same companies in all geographic or product areas 
accordingly  it is not possible to estimate the precise number of competitors or to identify our competitive position  although we believe that we are a principal competitor in most of our markets 
our principal method of competition is production of quality products at competitive prices in a timely and efficient manner 
our products have primary application in the aerospace  defense electronics  recreational vehicle  transportation  automated merchandising  petrochemical  chemical and power generation industries 
as such  our revenues are dependent upon numerous unpredictable factors  including changes in market demand  general economic conditions and capital spending 
because these products are also sold in a wide variety of markets and applications  we do not believe we can reliably quantify or predict the possible effects upon our business resulting from such changes 
our engineering and product development activities are directed primarily toward improvement of existing products and adaptation of existing products to particular customer requirements as well as the development of new products 
while we own numerous patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property  none are of such importance that termination would materially affect our business 
from time to time  however  we do engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property 
research and development research and development costs are expensed when incurred 
these costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and were incurred primarily by the aerospace electronics segment 
funds received from customer sponsored research and development projects were million  million and million in  and respectively  and were recorded in net sales 
our customers no customer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues in  or raw materials our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials  including steel  copper  cast iron  electronic components  aluminum  plastics and various petroleum based products 
we purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world 
although market forces have generally caused increases in the costs of steel and petroleum based products  there have been no raw materials shortages that have had a material adverse impact on our business  and we believe that we will generally be able to obtain adequate supplies of major raw material requirements or reasonable substitutes at reasonable costs 

table of contents part i item seasonal nature of business our business does not experience significant seasonality 
government contracts we have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities  primarily involving products in our aerospace electronics business segment and our fluid handling business segment 
as a result  we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government 
the laws and regulations governing government contracts differ from those governing private contracts 
for example  many government contracts require disclosure of cost and pricing data and impose certain sourcing conditions that are not applicable to private contracts 
our failure to comply with these laws could result in suspension of these contracts  criminal or civil sanctions  administrative penalties and fines or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time 
for example  as previously disclosed  we sold certain valves made by our fluid handling segment to private customers that ultimately were delivered to us military agencies which did not conform to certain contractual specifications relating to the place of manufacture and the origin of component parts 
subsequent to a us government investigation  in july  we executed a settlement agreement with the department of justice providing for  among other things  the payment of million to the united states 
for a further discussion of risks related to compliance with government contracting requirements  please refer to item a 
risk factors 
see part i  item legal proceedings regarding certain costs of compliance with federal  state and local laws and regulations involving the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment

in december  we executed amendment no 
to the facility for the purpose of removing a representation regarding our pension liability and to amend certain other terms 
the agreement contains a leverage ratio covenant requiring a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of less than or equal to

risk factors 
the following is a description of what we consider the key challenges and risks confronting our business 
this discussion should be considered in conjunction with the discussion under the caption forward looking information preceding part i  the information set forth under item  business and with the discussion of the business included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these risks comprise the material risks of which we are aware  however  these risks and uncertainties may not be the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect our business or financial performance 
if any of the events or developments described below or elsewhere in this annual report on form k  or in any documents that we subsequently file publicly were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks relating to our business we are subject to numerous lawsuits for asbestos related personal injury  and costs associated with these lawsuits may adversely affect our results of operations  cash flow and financial position 
we are subject to numerous lawsuits for asbestos related personal injury 
estimation of our ultimate exposure for asbestos related claims is subject to significant uncertainties  as there are multiple variables that can affect the timing  severity and quantity of claims 
our estimate of the future expense of these claims is derived from assumptions with respect to future claims  settlement and defense costs which are based on experience during the last few years and which may not prove reliable as predictors 
a significant upward or downward trend in the number of claims filed  depending on the nature of the alleged injury  the jurisdiction where filed and the quality of the product identification  or a significant upward or downward trend in the costs of defending claims  could change the estimated liability  as would any substantial adverse verdict at trial or on appeal 
a legislative solution or a revised structured settlement transaction could also change the estimated liability 
these uncertainties may result in our incurring future charges or increases to income to adjust the carrying value of recorded liabilities and assets  particularly if the number of claims and settlements and defense costs escalates or if legislation or another alternative solution is implemented  however  we are currently unable to predict such future events 
the resolution of these claims may take many years  and the effect on results of operations  cash flow and financial position in any given period from a revision to these estimates could be material 
as of december   we were one of a number of defendants in cases involving approximately  pending claims filed in various state and federal courts that allege injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pending claims  our historical settlement and defense costs for asbestos claims  the liability we have recorded in our financial statements for pending and reasonably anticipated asbestos claims through  the asset we have recorded in our financial statements related to our estimated insurance coverage for asbestos claims  and uncertainties related to our net asbestos liability 
we have recorded a liability for pending and reasonably anticipated asbestos claims through  and while it is probable that we will incur additional liabilities for asbestos claims after  which additional liabilities may be significant  we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of such additional liabilities at this time 
in the third quarter  we updated and extended the estimate of our asbestos liability and recorded an additional pre tax provision of approximately million  which includes a corresponding insurance receivable 
current economic conditions may harm our business  results of operations and stock price 
during  the us and global economies slowed dramatically as a result of a variety of problems  including turmoil in the credit and financial markets  concerns regarding the stability and viability of major financial institutions  the state of the housing markets and volatility in fuel prices and worldwide stock markets 
given the significance and widespread nature of these nearly unprecedented circumstances  the us and global economies could remain significantly challenged in a recessionary state for an indeterminate period of time 
while currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations  there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies 
in addition  the current tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments 
similarly  this tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy 
these conditions would harm our business by adversely affecting our revenues  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
during  our engineered materials business segment experienced significant declines in operating profit when compared to this decline reflected substantially lower sales to our traditional recreational vehicle customers  driven largely by the inability of consumers to obtain financing for rv purchases 
similarly  declining vending machine demand resulting from depressed conditions in the north american vending market has put pressure on our operating margins within our merchandising segment 
in our fluid handling segment  sales were adversely impacted during the second half of by slowing orders from short cycle north american businesses and delays of several large valve projects into as of december   we had million of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
the aforementioned disruptions in the credit markets and concerns about global economic growth have impacted our operating results  which has contributed to a decline in our stock price and corresponding market capitalization 
as of december   there was no impairment of these assets 
however  potential  further or sustained declines in our stock price and market capitalization  reduced future cash flow estimates within specific businesses  and slower growth rates in our target markets are all factors that may indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill and other long lived assets may not be recoverable and  accordingly  could result in material noncash impairment charges at some point in the future 

table of contents part i item a our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities  costs  litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and reputation 
our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate  which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground  air and water and establish standards for the generation  treatment  use  storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations 
we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in substantial compliance with environmental and health and safety laws 
failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal  monetary and non monetary penalties and damage to our reputation 
in addition  we cannot provide assurance that our costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
for example  during and  we recorded charges of million and million  respectively  related to increases in our expected liability at our goodyear  arizona superfund site pursuant to continuing changes in site conditions 
our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation  failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and reputation 
primarily in our aerospace electronics and fluid handling segments  we are required to comply with various export control laws  which may affect our transactions with certain customers 
in certain circumstances  export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products  services and technologies  and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item 
we are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts  including requirements related to procurement integrity  export control  employment practices  the accuracy of records and the recording of costs 
a failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting 
in addition  failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal  monetary and non monetary penalties  fines  disruptions to our business  limitations on our ability to export products and services  and damage to our reputation 
for example  in the third quarter  we recorded a million charge related to a civil false claims proceeding by the us government 
see the civil false claims settlement section under item pension expense associated with the company s retirement benefit plans may fluctuate significantly depending upon changes in actuarial assumptions and future market performance of plan assets 
a significant portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by pension and post retirement benefit plans  the costs of which are dependent upon various assumptions  including estimates of rates of return on benefit related assets  discount rates for future payment obligations  rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs 
in addition  funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension and post retirement benefit plans are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions 
variances from these estimates could have a sig nificant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
recent volatility in the financial markets has resulted in lower than expected returns on our pension plan assets 
currently  we expect a million increase in our estimated pension expense when compared to demand for our products is variable and subject to factors beyond our control  which could result in unanticipated events significantly impacting our results of operations 
a substantial portion of our sales is concentrated in industries that are cyclical in nature or subject to market conditions which may cause customers demand for our products to be volatile 
these industries often are subject to fluctuations in domestic and international economies as well as to currency fluctuations and inflationary pressures 
reductions in the business levels of these industries would reduce the sales and profitability of the affected business segments 
in our aerospace electronics segment  for example  a significant decline in demand for air travel  or a decline in airline profitability generally  could result in reduced orders for aircraft and could also cause airlines to reduce their purchases of repair parts from our businesses 
our aerospace businesses could also be impacted to the extent that major aircraft manufacturers  such as boeing which represented of the segment s revenue in encountered production problems  or if pricing pressure from aircraft customers caused the manufacturers to press their suppliers to lower prices 
in our engineered materials segment  sales and profits have been and will continue to be affected by declines in demand for truck trailers  rvs  or building products 
results in our controls segment could decline because of an unanticipated decline in demand for the businesses products from the oil and gas or heavy truck markets  or from unforeseen product obsolescence 
results at our merchandising systems business have been and will continue to be affected by employment levels  office occupancy rates and factors affecting vending operator profitability such as fuel  confection and borrowing costs 
we may be unable to improve productivity  reduce costs and align manufacturing capacity with customer demand 
we are committed to continuous productivity improvement and continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce costs  simplify or improve global processes  and increase the reliability of order fulfillment and satisfaction of customer needs 
during the fourth quarter  we initiated broad based restructuring actions to align our cost base to current market conditions which include facility consolidations  headcount reductions and other related cost reduction activities  which is described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii  item of this report  and under note  restructuring to the consolidated financial statements 
the restructuring program presents organizational challenges  particularly with respect to planned facility consolidation activities 
we cannot provide assurance that the restructuring program will be implemented in accordance with the planned timetable  the actual charges incurred will not exceed the estimated charges  or the full extent of the expected savings will be realized 
if the actual levels of savings achieved from our cost reduction measures are less than our current estimates  and if any unanticipated operational inefficiencies result from the restructuring program  our profitability would be adversely 
table of contents part i item a affected 
in addition  our failure to continue to anticipate further changes in global demand for our products and services and align our cost base accordingly would adversely affect our ability to achieve necessary cost savings in a timely manner 
we may be unable to successfully develop and introduce new products  which would limit our ability to grow and maintain our competitive position and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
our growth depends  in part  on continued sales of existing products  as well as the successful development and introduction of new products  which face the uncertainty of customer acceptance and reaction from competitors 
in our aerospace electronics segment  for example  if we are unable to successfully develop  fund and deliver new products for the boeing and the airbus am  our operating results would be adversely impacted 
also  any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market  which could compromise our competitive position 
further  the development and introduction of new products may require us to make investments in specialized personnel and capital expenditures  increase marketing efforts and reallocate resources away from other uses 
we also may need to modify our systems and strategy in light of new products that we develop 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products in a cost effective manner or otherwise manage effectively the operations related to new products  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
the prices of our raw materials can fluctuate dramatically  which may adversely affect our profitability 
the costs of certain raw materials that are critical to our profitability are volatile 
this volatility can have a significant impact on our profitability 
in our engineered materials segment  for example  profits could be adversely affected by unanticipated increases in resin and fiberglass material costs and by the inability on the part of the businesses to maintain their position in product cost and functionality against competing materials 
the costs in our fluid handling and merchandising systems segments similarly are affected by fluctuations in the price of metals such as steel 
while we have taken initiatives aimed at securing an adequate supply of raw materials at prices which are favorable to us  if the prices of critical raw materials increase  our operating costs could be negatively affected 
our ability to obtain parts and raw materials from our suppliers is uncertain  and any disruptions or delays in our supply chain could negatively affect our results of operations 
our operations require significant amounts of important parts and raw materials 
we are engaged in a continuous  company wide effort to concentrate our purchases of parts and raw materials on fewer suppliers  and to obtain parts from suppliers in low cost countries where possible 
as this effort progresses  we are exposed to an increased risk of disruptions to our supply chain  which could have a significant effect on our operating results 
in addition  if we are unable to procure these parts or raw materials  our operations may be disrupted  or we could experience a delay or halt in certain of our manufacturing operations 
we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risk and the costs of alternative practices 
nonetheless  supplier capacity constraints  supplier production disruptions  supplier financial condition  price vola tility or the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 
we may be unable to identify or to complete acquisitions  or to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire 
we have evaluated  and expect to continue to evaluate  a wide array of potential acquisition transactions 
our acquisition program attempts to address the potential risks inherent in assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  contingent or other liabilities  systems of internal controls and potential profitability of acquisition candidates  as well as other challenges such as retaining the employees and integrating the operations of the businesses we acquire 
integrating acquired operations involves significant risks and uncertainties  including maintenance of uniform standards  controls  policies and procedures  distraction of management s attention from normal business operations during the integration process  expenses associated with the integration efforts  and unidentified issues not discovered in the due diligence process  including legal contingencies 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition opportunities will be available in the future  that we will continue to acquire businesses or that any business acquired will be integrated successfully or prove profitable  which could adversely impact our growth rate 
our ability to achieve our growth goals depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate companies and businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated cost savings 
in addition  changes in accounting or regulatory requirements could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions 
we face significant competition which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial position in the future 
while we are a principal competitor in most of our markets  all of our markets are highly competitive 
our competitors in many of our business segments can be expected in the future to improve technologies  reduce costs and develop and introduce new products  and the ability of our business segments to achieve similar advances will be important to our competitive positions 
competitive pressures  including those discussed above  could cause one or more of our business segments to lose market share or could result in significant price erosion  either of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the united states and face risks inherent in non domestic operations 
net sales and assets related to our operations outside the united states were and in  and and in  respectively  of our consolidated amounts 
these operations and transactions are subject to the risks associated with conducting business internationally  including the risks of currency fluctuations  slower payment of invoices  adverse trade regulations and possible social  economic and political instability in the countries and regions in which we operate 
we are dependent on key personnel  and we may not be able to retain our key personnel or hire and retain additional personnel needed for us to sustain and grow our business as planned 
certain of our business segments and corporate offices are dependent upon highly qualified personnel  and we generally are depend 
table of contents part i item a ent upon the continued efforts of key management employees 
we may have difficulty retaining such personnel or locating and hiring additional qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  many of whom are not party to employment agreements with us  or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms could impair our ability to successfully sustain and grow our business  which could impact our results of operations in a materially adverse manner 
if our internal controls are found to be ineffective  our financial results or our stock price may be adversely affected 
our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december   in compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  our internal control over financial reporting was effective 
we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place for future periods  however  increased risk of internal control breakdowns generally exists in a business environment that is decentralized 
if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective  investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which may adversely affect our financial results or our stock price 
specific risks relating to our business segments the macroeconomic climate represents one of the most significant risks for and could cause our customers across our business segments to delay  forego or reduce the amount of their investments in our products or delay payments of amounts due to us 
in addition  declines in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  the british pound or the canadian dollar  could adversely affect our reported results  primarily in our fluid handling and merchandising systems segments  as amounts earned in other countries are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes 
aerospace electronics volatile fuel prices and a generally weaker economy continue to adversely impact the commercial aerospace industry as some larger domestic airline carriers have implemented plans to reduce service and capacity  including retiring their older and less fuel efficient aircraft  and cutting payroll costs  while several smaller carriers have either declared bankruptcy or shut down altogether 
lower levels of air travel or a decline in airline profitability generally could result in reduced aircraft orders and could also cause the airlines to scale back on more of their purchases of higher margin repair parts from our businesses 
our businesses could also be impacted to the extent that major aircraft manufacturers  such as boeing which represented and of the segment s revenue in and  respectively  encounter production problems  or if pricing pressure from aircraft customers causes the manufacturers to press their suppliers to lower prices 
our sales and profits could also face erosion if pricing pressure from competitors increased  if finding new aerospace qualified suppliers grew more difficult  if required technical personnel became harder to hire and retain  or if we are unable to achieve targeted cost savings in connection with the restructuring program and other cost reduction initiatives 
in addition  if planned new products were delayed  notably the boeing dreamliner  for which we continue to incur substantial engineering expenses for the development of the aircraft s brake control systems  our results of operations and cash flows would be negatively affected 
in this regard  during the second quarter of  we expect to complete development of the brake control system for the boeing that meets the originally specified requirements although engineering efforts at reduced levels will be needed to support test flights 
however  boeing has communicated certain changed aircraft requirements that affect the brake control system  and we have recently entered into discussions with our customer  ge aviation systems  regarding development of a new version of the brake control system  including whether this additional development work will be funded by the customer 
although it is our position that we are not required to undertake this additional development work without customer funding  if such customer funding is not obtained and we are required to develop a new version of the brake control system  it would have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
a portion of this segment s business is conducted under us government contracts and subcontracts 
these contracts are either competitively bid or sole source contracts 
competitively bid contracts are awarded after a formal bid and proposal competition among suppliers 
sole source contracts are awarded when a single contractor is deemed to have an expertise or technology that is superior to that of competing contractors 
a reduction in congressional appropriations that affect defense spending or the ability of the us government to terminate our contracts could impact the performance of this business 
in addition  we are required to comply with various export control laws  which may affect our transactions with certain customers 
in certain circumstances  export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products  services and technologies  and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item 
a failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting 
failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal  monetary and non monetary penalties  fines  disruptions to our business  limitations on our ability export products and services  and damage to our reputation 
engineered materials in our engineered materials segment  sales and profits could continue to fall if there are further declines in demand for truck trailers  recreational vehicles and building products for which our businesses produce fiberglass reinforced panels 
we experienced continued declines in rv orders through as the rv industry continued to sharply curtail production in response to a fall off in demand from their customers 
the industry attributes this downturn to the lack of credit available to consumers  generally weak consumer confidence and  to a lesser extent  higher gas prices and inventory reductions on dealer lots 
while the short term is uncertain  in the longer term the demographic fundamentals continue to be positive for the growth of rv sales 
profits could also be adversely affected by unanticipated increases in resin and fiberglass material costs  by the loss of a principal supplier or by any inability on the part of the businesses to maintain their product cost and functionality advantages when compared to competing materials  as well as by our failure to achieve targeted cost savings in connection with the restructuring program and other cost reduction initiatives  furthermore  any unanticipated operational inefficiencies resulting from consolidation activities pursuant to 
table of contents part i item b the restructuring program would also adversely affect our profitability 
we have been defending two separate lawsuits brought by customers alleging failure of our fiberglass reinforced plastic material in recreational vehicle sidewalls manufactured by such customers 
the first lawsuit went to trial in january  resulting in an award of million in compensatory damages on two out of seven claims 
the court denied the plaintiff s claim for additional post trial equitable relief  and entered a final judgment  which included prejudgment interest of approximately million 
the total award of million was paid in mid  and the plaintiff has waived its right to an appeal 
the other lawsuit went to trial in mid january of solely on the issue of liability  and on january the jury returned a verdict of liability against the company 
the next phase of the trial  to be scheduled in the fall of  will determine damages 
the aggregate damages sought in this lawsuit include approximately million in repair costs allegedly incurred by the plaintiffs  as well as approximately million in other consequential losses such as discounts and other incentives paid to induce sales  lost market share  and lost profits 
the company will actively explore its appellate options with a view toward overturning this verdict and will vigorously defend itself against the damages sought 
the company is in discussions with its insurers regarding coverage for this liability 
we are also defending a series of five separate lawsuits  which have now been consolidated  revolving around a fire that occurred in may at a chicken processing plant located near atlanta  georgia that destroyed the plant 
the aggregate damages demanded by the plaintiff are in excess of million 
these lawsuits contend that certain fiberglass reinforced plastic material manufactured by us that was installed inside the plant was unsafe in that it acted as an accelerant  causing the fire to spread rapidly  resulting in the total loss of the plant and property 
the suits are in the early stages of pre trial discovery and we believe that we have valid defenses to the underlying claims raised in these lawsuits 
we have given notice of these lawsuits to our insurance carriers  and will seek coverage for any resulting losses 
based on our review of coverage  however  we have determined that we are facing a potential million gap in insurance coverage  for the layer of insurance which would have provided protection for losses above million but below million 
we have initiated certain actions aimed at closing the gap in insurance coverage 
if the plaintiffs in these lawsuits were to prevail at trial and be awarded the full extent of their claimed damages  and the gap in coverage was not closed  the resulting liability could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows in the periods affected 
merchandising systems results at our businesses could be reduced by continued unfavorable economic conditions  including lower demand for our products and services  inflation and continued increases in fuel costs 
in addition  delays in launching or supplying new products or an inability to achieve new product sales objectives  unfavorable changes in gaming regulations affecting certain of our payment solutions customers  as well as by our failure to achieve targeted cost savings in connection with the restructuring program and other cost reduction initiatives would adversely affect our profitability  furthermore  any unanticipated operational inefficiencies resulting from consolidation activities pursuant to the restructuring program would also adversely affect our profitability 
results at our foreign locations have been and will continue to be affected by fluctuations in the value of the euro  the british pound and the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
fluid handling our businesses could face increased price competition from larger competitors 
slowing of the economy or major markets could reduce sales and profits  particularly if projects for which these businesses are suppliers or bidders are cancelled or delayed 
during the second half of we experienced slowing orders from short cycle north american businesses as well as delays of several large valve projects into continued weakness in short cycle north american businesses and or further delays in large valve projects may put further pressure on operating margins in the fluid handling segment 
in addition  to the extent we do not achieve targeted cost savings in connection with the restructuring program and other cost reduction initiatives  our operating results would be adversely affected 
at our foreign operations  reported results in us dollar terms could be eroded by a weakening of currency of the respective businesses  particularly where we operate using the euro and british pound 
the company made two acquisitions in its fluid handling segment in a manufacturer of specialty valve flow solutions for the power  oil and gas  and chemical markets  and a manufacturer of regulators and fire safe valves for the gas industry  and safety valves and air vent valves for the building services market 
the results of this segment could be adversely affected if unexpected problems are experienced in the integration of these businesses 
controls a number of factors could affect our controls segment s results 
lower sales and earnings could result if our businesses cannot maintain their cost competitiveness  encounter delays in introducing new products or fail to achieve their new product sales objectives 
results could decline because of an unanticipated decline in demand for the businesses products from the industrial machinery  oil and gas or heavy equipment industries  or from unforeseen product obsolescence 
a portion of this segment s business is subject to government rules and regulations 
failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting 
failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal  monetary and non monetary penalties  disruptions to our business  limitations on our ability export products and services  and damage to our reputation

table of contents part ii item item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we are a diversified manufacturer of highly engineered industrial products 
our business consists of five segments aerospace electronics  engineered materials  merchandising systems  fluid handling and controls 
our primary markets are aerospace  defense electronics  recreational vehicle  transportation  automated merchandising  chemical  pharmaceutical  oil gas  power  nuclear  building services and utilities 
during  we completed two acquisitions at a total cost of million in cash and the assumption of million in debt 
specifically  in december  we acquired friedrich krombach gmbh company kg armaturenwerke and krombach international gmbh  krombach  a leading manufacturer of specialty valve flow solutions for the power  oil and gas  and chemical markets for million in cash and the assumption of million of net debt  and in september  we acquired delta fluid products limited delta  a leading designer and manufacturer of regulators and fire safe valves for the gas industry  and safety valves and air vent valves for the building services market  for million in cash 
items affecting comparability of reported results the comparability of our operating results for the years ended december   and is affected by the following significant items restructuring and related costs actions 
during the fourth quarter of  we initiated broad based restructuring actions to align our cost base to current market conditions which include facility consolidations  headcount reductions and other related costs  the restructuring program 
at december   we recorded pre tax restructuring and related charges in the business segments totaling million as follows aerospace electronics million  engineered materials million  merchandising systems million  fluid handling million and controls million 
the charges include workforce reduction expenses and facility exit costs of million and million related to asset write downs 
we expect the actions to result in net workforce reductions of approximately employees  the exiting of five facilities and the disposal of assets associated with the exited facilities 
we are targeting the majority of all workforce and all facility related cost reduction actions for completion during approximately of the total pre tax charge will require cash payments  which we will fund with cash generated from operations 
we expect to incur additional restructuring and related charges of million during to complete these actions as follows aerospace electronics million  engineered materials million and merchandising systems million we expect recurring pre tax savings subsequent to completing all actions to approximate million annually 
actions 
during the fourth quarter of  our fluid handling segment commenced implementation of a restructuring program designed to further enhance operating margins through ceasing the manufacture of malleable iron and bronze fittings at foundry operating facilities in the uk and canada  respectively  and exiting both facilities and transferring production to china the foundry restructuring 
the program primarily includes work force reduction expenses and facility exit costs  all of which are expected to be cash costs 
in december  we recognized workforce reduction charges of million and  also in december  pursuant to this program  we sold our foundry facility in the uk  generating a pre tax gain of million 
we expect to incur total pre tax charges  upon program completion  of approximately million 
the foundry restructuring is expected to be substantially completed by the middle of we expect pre tax savings to approximate million annually 
environmental charge for environmental matters  we record a liability for estimated remediation costs when it is probable that we will be responsible for such costs and they can be reasonably estimated 
generally  third party specialists assist in the estimation of remediation costs 
the environmental remediation liability at december  and is substantially all for the former manufacturing site in goodyear  arizona the site discussed below 
the site was operated by unidynamics phoenix  inc upi  which became an indirect subsidiary of ours in when we acquired upi s parent company  unidynamics corporation 
upi manufactured explosive and pyrotechnic compounds  including components for critical military programs  for the us government at the site from to  under contracts with the department of defense and other government agencies and certain of their prime contractors 
no manufacturing operations have been conducted at the site since the site was placed on the national priorities list in  and is now part of the phoenix goodyear airport north superfund site 
in  the us environmental protection agency epa issued administrative orders requiring upi to design and carry out certain remedial actions  which upi has done 
groundwater extraction and treatment systems have been in operation at the site since a soil vapor extraction system was in operation from to  was restarted in  and is currently in operation 
on july   we entered into a consent decree with the epa with respect to the site providing for  among other things  a work plan for further investigation and remediation activities at the site 
we recorded a liability in for estimated costs through after reaching substantial agreement on the scope of work with the epa 
at the end of september  the liability totaled million 
during the fourth quarter of  we and our technical advisors determined that changing groundwater flow rates and contaminant plume direction at the site required additional extraction systems as well as modifications and upgrades of the existing systems 
in consultation with our technical advisors  we prepared a forecast of the expenditures required for these new and upgraded systems as well as the costs of operation over the forecast period through taking these additional costs into consideration  we estimated our liability for the costs of such activities through to be million as of december  during the fourth quarter of  based on further consultation with our advisors and the epa and in response to groundwater monitoring results that reflected a continuing migration in contaminant plume direction during the year  we revised our forecast of remedial activities to reflect an increase in the number of extraction systems and monitoring wells in and around the site  among other things 
our revised liability estimate of million  which is included in accrued liabilities and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  resulted in an additional charge of million in december 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
on july   we entered into a consent decree with the us department of justice doj on behalf of the department of defense and the department of energy pursuant to which  among other things  the us government reimburses us for percent of qualifying costs of investigation and remediation activities at the site 
as of december   we have recorded a receivable of million for the expected reimbursements from the us government in respect of the aggregate liability as at that date 
asbestos charge with the assistance of outside experts  during the third quarter of  we updated and extended our estimate of our asbestos liability  including the costs of settlement or indemnity payments and defense costs relating to currently pending claims and future claims projected to be filed against us through our previous estimate was for asbestos claims filed through as a result of this updated estimate  we recorded an additional pre tax provision of million during the third quarter of this amount includes a corresponding insurance receivable 
our decision to take this action was based on several factors  including the number of asbestos claims being filed against us has moderated substantially over the past several years  and in our opinion  the outlook for asbestos claims expected to be filed and resolved in the forecast period should be reasonably stable  the stable outlook for future claims is particularly true for mesothelioma claims  which although constituting only of our asbestos claims account for approximately of our aggregate settlement and defense costs over the past five years  federal legislation that would significantly change the nature of asbestos litigation failed to pass in  and in our opinion  the prospects for such legislation at the federal level are remote  there have been significant actions taken by certain state legislatures and courts over the past several years that have reduced the number and types of claims that can proceed to trial  which has been a significant factor in stabilizing the asbestos claim activity  and we have now entered into coverage in place agreements with a majority of our excess insurers  which enables us to project a more stable relationship between settlement and defense costs paid by us and reimbursements from our insurers 
taking all of these factors into account  we believe that we can reasonably estimate the asbestos liability for pending claims and future claims to be filed through while it is probable that we will incur additional charges for asbestos liabilities and defense costs in excess of the amounts currently provided  we do not believe that any such amount can be reasonably estimated beyond accordingly  no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be incurred for claims made subsequent to the liability was million and  million as of december  and  respectively 
civil false claims settlement during the third quarter of  we recorded a million charge related to a civil false claims proceeding by the us government  arising out of allegations that certain valves sold by our crane valves north america unit cvna to private customers that ultimately were delivered to us military agencies did not conform to contractual specifications relating to the place of manufacture and the origin of component parts 
the allegations originated with a qui tam complaint filed under seal by a former cvna employee 
the civil division of the department of justice doj ultimately intervened in that case  and on march   filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the southern district of texas seeking unspecified damages for violations of the false claims act  and other common law claims 
the complaint alleged that cvna failed to notify the correct us military agency when our manufacturing location for mil spec valves listed on the qualified products list was moved from long beach  california to conroe  texas in as a result  the complaint alleged that the valves manufactured in texas were not properly listed on the qualified product list as required by the contract specifications 
we received a letter from the department of the navy on february   conveying the navy s concerns about the qualified products list allegations raised by the doj 
the department of the navy advised us that  if true  these allegations could potentially result in us and our subsidiaries and affiliates being suspended and or debarred from doing business with the us government 
we cooperated with the government s investigation of these matters and executed a settlement agreement with the doj providing for  among other things  the payment of million to the united states and  to pay the legal fees of the former employee who filed the qui tam complaint 
in addition  we negotiated an administrative agreement with the department of the navy for a term of three years pursuant to which we have implemented certain changes to our compliance programs and report to the navy on a quarterly basis 
these agreements were executed and became effective on july  we acknowledged the failure to notify the navy and update the qualified products list but we denied that this omission violated the false claims act 
the failure to notify the navy was unintentional and there was no misconduct by our personnel 
we decided to settle this matter to avoid the risks of costly and protracted legal proceedings

the restructuring program  together with an anticipated million reduction in aerospace engineering spending and other ongoing cost reduction efforts will result in a pre tax  year over year savings approaching million in aerospace electronics 
our aerospace electronics segment has experienced a significant decline in operating profit in when compared to the same period last year 
this decline was driven by substantially higher engineering expense in the aerospace group related to the development of new products for the boeing and airbus am programs 
spending will remain at high levels until the second quarter of  which is when the company expects to complete development of the brake control system for the boeing that meets the originally specified requirements although engineering efforts at reduced levels will be needed to support test flights 
this is expected to reduce engineering expense by million when compared to however  boeing has communicated certain changed aircraft requirements that affect the brake control system  and we have recently entered into discussions with our customer  ge aviation systems  regarding development of a new version of the brake control system  including whether this additional development work will be funded by the customer 
it is the company s position that it is not required to undertake this additional development work without customer funding  and the costs of such work  which could be material  are not included in our outlook 
partially offsetting the expected benefit of lower engineering expense  continued deterioration in airline industry market conditions is expected to have an unfavorable impact on aerospace group sales of higher margin aftermarket products 
as a result  in  we expect a decline in aerospace group sales  but a modest improvement in operating profit 
in the electronics group  sales are expected to be up slightly in with modest improvement in operating margin resulting from productivity improvements and higher margins on customer contracts

continued declines in many of our markets are anticipated in and  accordingly  both sales and operating profit will be adversely impacted 
compared to  however  we expect operating profit to be higher  reflecting the absence of million of restructuring charges recorded in the fourth quarter of the impact of the volume declines are expected to be somewhat offset by continued focus on gaining rv market share through targeted product placements as well as savings expected from facility consolidation and other cost reduction initiatives 
longer term  business fundamentals continue to be positive for these markets due to continued displacement of traditional materials by fiberglass reinforced plastic 
merchandising systems 
declining vending machine demand resulting from depressed conditions in the north american vending market and  to a lesser extent  in our payment solutions end markets  has put pressure on our operating margins within our merchandising systems segment 
in response to these unfavorable market conditions  we have taken significant steps to reduce costs including reducing headcount by during in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we initiated facility consolidation plans and further headcount reductions that will occur in compared to  we anticipate a decline in sales driven largely by the aforementioned weak economic conditions and unfavorable foreign exchange  somewhat offset by share gains through targeted customer initiatives and leveraging new product introductions across the business 
we expect operating profit to be generally flat when compared to  which reflects the unfavorable impact of lower sales  offset by lower restructuring charges  continued emphasis on lean manufacturing and savings expected from consolidation activities and other cost reduction initiatives 
fluid handling 
in our fluid handling segment  while demand from the global chemical  pharmaceutical and energy industries remained firm during the first half of  sales were adversely impacted beginning in the third quarter by slowing orders from short cycle north american businesses and delays of several large valve projects 
with our new regional sales office in dubai  we have increased our customer focus in the middle east  and deployed additional sales personnel in asia as well as russia and other cis countries 
our presence in eastern europe was enhanced by the december acquisition of krombach  providing our expanded global sales force with additional products 
in  we expect to partially offset the impact of further core business declines and unfavorable foreign exchange with the continuation of disciplined pricing  operational excellence and expanded low cost sourcing at all of the fluid handling businesses  such as those expected from the foundry restructuring  as well as savings expected from the restructuring program and other cost reduction initiatives 
considering all of the foregoing  in particular our concerns regarding global economic growth  we expect a modest decline in sales and operating profit in controls 
we expect a modest decline in sales for due largely to continued softness in the oil and gas and transportation markets 
we expect to offset the impact of this decline with savings associated with restructuring activities and other cost reduction initiatives 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased million to at december  compared with million at december  our operating philosophy is to use cash provided from operating activities to provide value to shareholders by paying dividends and or repurchasing shares  by reinvesting in existing businesses and by making acquisitions that will complement our portfolio of businesses 
we believe that cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our existing committed million revolving credit facility  which expires in september  will be sufficient to finance short and long term capital requirements  as well as fund cash payments associated with our asbestos and environmental exposures and restructuring program initiatives 
we have no significant debt maturities coming due until the third quarter of  when senior  unsecured notes having an aggregate principal amount of million mature 
we updated and extended the estimate of our net asbestos liability and recorded an additional provision of million during the third quarter of this provision was based on the total liability to cover the estimated cost of asbestos claims currently pending and to be subsequently asserted through similarly  during the fourth quarter of and  we updated our estimate of environmental remediation costs projected through related to our superfund site in goodyear  arizona  and recorded an additional provision of million and million  respectively 
although these increases did not have an immediate impact on our liquidity  they represent the incremental estimate of future cash payments associated with such exposures 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in the million decrease was due primarily to a net asbestos payment of million during in  compared to a million net asbestos payment in the net asbestos payment in includes a million insurance settlement receipt from equitas limited and a million settlement receipt from employers reinsurance company 
this unfavorable year over year comparison was partially offset by lower tax payments in versus cash payments related to asbestos settlement and defense costs  net of related insurance recoveries  are expected to be million in recent disruptions in the credit markets and concerns about global economic growth for industrial businesses have had a significant adverse impact on financial markets and  to an extent  our operating results in for example  our engineered materials business segment experienced significant declines in operating profit when compared to this decline reflected substantially lower sales to our traditional recreational vehicle customers  driven largely by the inability of consumers to obtain financing for rv

purchases 
similarly  declining vending machine demand resulting from depressed conditions in the north american vending market has put pressure on our operating margins within our merchandising systems segment 
in our fluid handling segment  sales were adversely impacted during the second half of by slowing orders from short cycle north american businesses and delays of several large valve projects into in order to align our cost base to current market conditions  during the fourth quarter of  we initiated the restructuring program  resulting in a pre tax charge of million 
we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately million during in connection with this program total pre tax charges  upon program completion  of approximately million 
approximately of the total expected charges  or million  will be cash costs 
of this amount  approximately million is expected to be paid in and which we will fund with cash provided by operations  however  we currently expect to achieve million in savings in from this program 
we have various other cost reduction initiatives which  together with targeted savings from the restructuring program and an expected million reduction in engineering expense associated with our development of the brake control system for the boeing  will result in year over year savings approaching million 
although we believe our cost reduction programs will have a meaningful impact and are designed to align our cost structure to lower levels of demand expected in  to the extent global demand for industrial products and services declines further  and or if we are required to provide further unfunded engineering resources for the development of brake control systems for the boeing  we will have lower operating profit than we currently expect  and we may need to implement additional restructuring initiatives  both of which would have an adverse impact on our operating cash flow 
in addition  during the year ended december  and continuing through the date of this report  actual returns for our pension plans were below the expected long term rates of return due to the current adverse conditions in the global securities markets 
continued actual returns below expected returns may increase the amount and timing of future contributions to these plans 
we currently expect to make pension contributions of million in  compared to million in in addition  we expect that  based on current information  pension contributions in will exceed the planned contributions 
investing activities cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures and cash flows from divestitures of businesses or assets 
cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million used in the comparable period of in  we made payments of million for acquisitions  which compares to million in capital expenditures of million in were generally consistent with those in capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity  replacing equipment  supporting new product development and improving information systems

financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of debt and common stock  and financing uses of cash consist primarily of repayments of indebtedness  repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends to shareholders 
cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million used in the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher dividends paid and an increase in common shares acquired on the open market 
financing arrangements at december   we had total debt of million as compared to million at december  net debt increased by million to million at december   primarily reflecting lower cash balances 
the net debt to net capitalization was at december   up from at december  in september  we entered into a five year  million amended and restated credit agreement the facility

credit ratings as of december   our senior unsecured debt was rated bbb by standard poor s and baa by moody s investors service 
although prevailing market conditions are somewhat unsettled  we believe that  nonetheless  these ratings should afford us adequate access to the public and private markets for debt

application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  nature of operations and significant accounting policies to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
the accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and  therefore  are critical to understanding our results of operations 
we have discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition sales revenue is recorded when a product is shipped  title risk of loss passes to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue on long term  fixed price contracts is recorded on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the measurement basis for progress toward completion 
sales under cost reimbursement type contracts are recorded as costs are incurred 
accounts receivable we continually monitor collections from customers  and in addition to providing an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon a customer s financial condition  we record a provision for estimated credit losses when customer accounts exceed days past due 
we aggressively pursue collection efforts on these overdue accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and was million and million  respectively 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or market and regularly review inventory values on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory primarily based on historical performance and our forecast of product demand over the next two years 
as actual future demand or market conditions vary from those projected by us  adjustments will be required 
valuation of long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets as circumstances warrant 
these reviews are based upon projections of anticipated future undiscounted cash flows 
no impairment charges were necessary for the three years ended december  while we believe these estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect valuations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires an asset and liability approach for the financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected 
table of contents part ii item future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
these balances are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year s in which these temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
accordingly  we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
goodwill and other intangible assets as of december   we had million of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we perform an annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives  as required 
if the carrying value of goodwill or an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the fair value for purposes of testing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
no impairment charges have been required during  or contingencies the categories of claims for which we have estimated our liability  the amount of our liability accruals  and the estimates of our related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings and other contingencies 
please refer to note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
pension plans in the us  we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that covers approximately of all us employees 
the benefits are based on years of service and compensation on a final average pay basis  except for certain hourly employees where benefits are fixed per year of service 
this plan is funded with a trustee in respect to past and current service 
charges to expense are based upon costs computed by an independent actuary 
our funding policy is to contribute  annually  amounts that are allowable for federal or other income tax purposes 
these contributions are intended to provide for future benefits earned to date and those expected to be earned in the future 
a number of our non us subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover approximately of all non us employees 
the benefits are typically based upon years of service and compensation 
these plans are generally funded with trustees in respect to past and current service 
charges to expense are based upon costs computed by independent actuaries 
our funding policy is to contribute  annually  amounts that are allowable for tax purposes or mandated by local statutory requirements 
these contributions are intended to provide for future benefits earned to date and those expected to be earned in the future 
the net periodic pension cost was in  million in and million in employer cash contributions were million in  million in and million in we expect  based on current actuarial calculations  to contribute cash of approximately million to our pension plans in cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of plan assets  however  we expect pension contributions in will exceed the planned contributions 
for the pension plan  holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the expected long term rate of return of plan assets by percentage points would have decreased increased us pension expense by million for us pension plans and million for non us pension plans 
also  holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by percentage points would have decreased increased pension expense by million for us pension plans and million for non us pension plans 
see note  pension and postretirement benefits  to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care trend rates on the postretirement health care benefit expense and obligation 
the following key assumptions were used to calculate the benefit obligation and net periodic cost for the periods indicated pension benefits december  benefit obligations us plans discount rate rate of compensation increase non us plans discount rate rate of compensation increase net periodic benefit cost us plans discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increase non us plans discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increase in developing the long term rate of return assumption  we evaluated input from actuaries and investment consultants as well as long term inflation assumptions 
projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices 
the discount rate we used for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations 
postretirement benefits other than pensions we and certain of our subsidiaries provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to current and former employees hired before january   who meet minimum age and years of service requirements 
we do not pre fund these benefits and retain the right to modify or terminate the plans 
we expect  based on current actuarial calculations  to contribute cash of million to our postretirement benefit plans in the weighted average discount rates assumed to determine postretirement benefit obligations were  and for  and  respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage our exposures to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of interest rate swap agreements and forward exchange contracts

the following is an analysis of the potential changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates based upon sensitivity analysis that models effects of shifts in rates 
these are not forecasts 
our year end portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed rate debt  therefore  the effect of a market change in interest rates would not be significant
