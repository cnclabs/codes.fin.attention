item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
unless otherwise noted  all dollar amounts in tables are in millions and those relating to our results of operations are presented before taxes 
we operate two of the most recognized brands in the global vehicle rental industry through avis rent a car system  llc and budget rent a car system  inc we provide car and truck rentals and ancillary services to businesses and consumers in the united states and internationally 
we operate in the following business segments domestic car rental provides car rentals and ancillary products and services in the united states 
international car rental provides vehicle rentals and ancillary products and services primarily in argentina  australia  canada  new zealand  puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
truck rental provides truck rentals and related services to consumers and light commercial users in the united states 
our revenues are derived principally from car and truck rentals in our company owned operations and include i time and mileage t m fees charged to our customers for vehicle rentals  ii reimbursement from our customers for certain operating expenses we incur  including gasoline and vehicle licensing fees  as well as airport concession fees  which we pay in exchange for the right to operate at airports and other locations  and iii sales of loss damage waivers and insurance and rentals of navigation units and other items in conjunction with vehicle rentals 
we also earn royalty revenue from our franchisees in conjunction with their vehicle rental transactions 
car rental volumes are closely associated with the travel industry  particularly airline passenger volumes  or enplanements 
because we operate primarily in the united states and generate a significant portion of our revenue from our on airport operations  we expect that our ability to generate revenue growth will be somewhat dependent on increases in domestic enplanements 
we have also experienced significant per unit fleet cost increases over the last four years  which have negatively impacted our margins 
accordingly  our ability to achieve profit margins consistent with prior periods remains dependent on our ability to successfully manage our fleet costs and to implement corresponding changes in our pricing programs 
our vehicle rental operations are seasonal 
historically  the third quarter of the year has been our strongest quarter due to the increased level of leisure travel and household moving activity 
any circumstance or occurrence that disrupts rental activity during the third quarter could have a disproportionate adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have a partially variable cost structure and routinely adjust the size and  therefore  the cost of our rental fleet in response to fluctuations in demand 
however  certain expenses  such as rent  are fixed and cannot be reduced in response to seasonal fluctuations in our operations 
we believe that the following trends  among others  may affect and or have impacted our financial condition and results of operations domestic enplanements  which declined in compared to and  based on airlines announced projected capacity reductions  are expected to decline again in  rising per unit car fleet cost and changes in conditions in the used vehicle marketplace  changes in the financial condition of vehicle manufacturers  difficulty in achieving sustained pricing increases  our expansion in off airport or local vehicle rentals  including insurance replacement rentals  increases in borrowing costs for corporate and vehicle related debt  and demand for truck rentals  which has been impacted by a decline in household moving activity 
many of these trends are the result of the current downturn in the us and worldwide economies and have caused ebitda for our domestic car rental and truck rental segments for the year ended december  to be significantly lower than for the year ended december  due to reduced demand for travel services  rising borrowing costs and other factors  there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy the minimum ebitda requirement and other covenants contained in our senior credit facilities  and our asset backed car rental conduit facilities 
failure to comply with such covenants could significantly impact our liquidity if we were unable to obtain an amendment or waiver or were unable to refinance or obtain a replacement for such facilities 
there can also be no assurance that results will be indicative of results we will achieve in we have also been impacted by  and may be further impacted by  the current financial market disruptions as we rely heavily on financing for our operations  particularly asset backed financing 
the amendments we obtained to our senior credit facilities and asset backed car rental conduit facilities in october and december amended the pricing  financial covenants and other terms in those facilities 
as a result  our borrowing costs under such facilities will increase in compared to and the letter of credit availability and borrowing capacity under our senior credit facilities were reduced 
these asset backed car rental conduit facilities mature from september through december of to the extent we were to require any further amendment or waiver under our senior credit facilities or asset backed car rental conduit facilities  our borrowing costs would likely increase even further 
see risk factors risks related to our indebtedness 
results of operations discussed below are our consolidated results of operations and the results of operations for each of our reportable segments 
generally accepted accounting principles require us to segregate and report as discontinued operations  for all periods presented  the account balances and activities of realogy  wyndham and travelport 
we measure performance using the following key operating statistics i rental days  which represents the total number of days or portion thereof a vehicle was rented  and ii t m revenue per rental day  which represents the average daily revenue we earned from rental and mileage fees charged to our customers 
our car rental operating statistics rental days and t m revenue per rental day are all calculated based on the actual usage of the vehicle during a hour period 
we believe that this methodology  while conservative  provides our management with the most relevant statistics in order to manage the business 
our calculation may not be comparable to other companies calculation of similarly titled statistics 
the reportable segments presented below represent our operating segments for which separate financial information is available and is utilized on a regular basis by our chief operating decision maker to assess performance and to allocate resources 
in identifying our reportable segments  we also consider the nature of services provided by our operating segments 
management evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon revenue and ebitda  which we define as income from continuing operations before non vehicle related depreciation and amortization  any impairment of goodwill  other intangible asset or equity investment  non vehicle related interest and income taxes 
our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  our consolidated results of operations comprised the following change net revenues total expenses loss before income taxes benefit from income taxes loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of tax gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax net loss during  our net revenues decreased million principally due to a million decrease in t m revenue  reflecting a decrease in domestic and international car rental t m revenue per day and a decrease in our truck rental t m revenue per day  offset by a million increase in ancillary revenues  such as counter sales of insurance products  gps navigation unit rentals  gasoline sales and fees charged to customers 
in addition  the total revenue decrease includes a million favorable effect related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our international operations results into us dollars 
the total expense increase of million was principally due to i a million increase in vehicle depreciation and lease charges resulting from an increase in per unit fleet costs  ii a million increase in operating expenses  representing higher gasoline costs which increased million  vehicle licensing expenses and other items  iii a million increase in impairment charges recorded for the impairment of goodwill  our tradenames asset and our equity investment in carey holdings  inc carey  iv million in restructuring costs primarily associated with severance related expenses and costs incurred for closing facilities and v the absence of million in net separation related expenses primarily resulting from tax related items 
the increase in total expenses includes an adverse impact from foreign currency exchange rates of million  offset by a gain on foreign currency earnings hedges of million 
as a result of these items  offset by a million increase in our benefit from income taxes  our loss from continuing operations increased million 
our effective tax rate for continuing operations was a benefit of and for and  respectively

during  we recorded a charge of  million for the impairment of goodwill 
domestic car rental recorded million of the goodwill impairment  international car rental recorded million and truck rental recorded million 
domestic car rental revenues increased million less than while ebitda decreased million in compared with revenue increased due to growth in ancillary revenues offset by lower car rental pricing 
ebitda margins were negatively impacted year over year by lower car rental pricing  increased fleet costs and severance costs 
the revenue increase of million was comprised of a million increase in ancillary revenues  offset by a million decrease in t m revenue 
the million increase in ancillary revenues was primarily due to i a million increase in rentals of gps navigation units  our implementation of an energy recovery fee  sales of insurance products and other items  ii a million increase in gasoline sales  which was more than offset in ebitda by million of higher gasoline expense including an unfavorable impact of million from gasoline hedges  and iii a million increase in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenues  million of which was offset in ebitda by higher airport concession and vehicle licensing expenses remitted to airport and other regulatory authorities 
the decrease in t m revenue was principally driven by a decrease in t m revenue per day  while rental days remained essentially unchanged year over year 
the favorable effect of increased revenues was offset in ebitda by million of increased fleet depreciation and lease charges resulting from an increase in per unit fleet costs  while the average size of our domestic rental fleet decreased 
ebitda also reflected a million increase in operating and selling  general and administrative and other expenses including i million of restructuring charges recorded in primarily due to expenses related to severance and the closure of rental facilities  ii million of incremental operating expenses primarily representing inflationary increases in wages and salaries  off airport rental expense and other costs offset by expense savings from our process improvement and cost reduction initiatives  and iii a million increase in selling  general and administration expense primarily related to higher travel agency commissions  travel incentive programs and other marketing costs 
international car rental revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with revenue and ebitda increased primarily due to growth in ancillary revenues and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
the revenue increase of million was comprised of a million increase in ancillary revenues and a million increase in car rental t m revenue 
the total growth in revenue includes a million increase related to foreign currency exchange rates  impacting t m revenue by million and ancillary revenues by million  and was largely offset in ebitda by the opposite impact of foreign exchange on expenses of million 
the million increase in ancillary revenues was primarily due to i a million increase in counter sales of insurance  rentals of gps navigation units and other items  ii a million increase in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenues  million of which was offset in ebitda by higher airport concession and vehicle licensing expense remitted to airport and other regulatory authorities  and iii a million increase in gasoline sales  which was more than offset in ebitda by higher gasoline costs 
the increase in t m revenue was principally driven by a increase in rental days  while t m revenue per day remained essentially unchanged year over year 
the favorable effect of incremental t m revenues was offset in ebitda by million of increased fleet depreciation and lease charges  reflecting a increase in the average size of our international rental fleet and a increase in per unit fleet costs 
ebitda also reflects a million increase in incremental operating expenses including i a million increase in salaries and wages  rents and other costs  ii a million increase in selling  general and administrative expense related primarily to increased agency operator commissions  marketing and other expenses  and iii million of restructuring charges recorded in for severance related expenses and costs for facility closures 
these cost increases were offset by a million reduction in insurance costs due to favorable claims experience and a million gain on our foreign exchange earnings hedges 
truck rental revenues and ebitda declined million and million  respectively  in compared with the revenue decrease was due to a decline of million in t m revenue  which reflected a decrease in t m revenue per day and a decrease in rental days in compared with the unfavorable effect of decreased revenue on ebitda was partially offset by million less fleet depreciation  lease charges and interest primarily reflecting an increase in the planned service lives of our truck fleet 
ebitda also reflected a decrease of million in operating commission expense primarily as a result of the decrease in t m revenue  and million of restructuring charges recorded in for severance related expenses 
corporate and other revenue and ebitda declined million and million  respectively  in compared with the revenue decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenues earned for information technology and other service contracts with realogy  wyndham and travelport as the contracts expire and various services are no longer required 
ebitda decreased primarily due to the absence of a million credit related to tax related receivables from realogy and wyndham  recognized in connection with the adoption of fasb interpretation no

the growth in our car rental operations was partially offset by a reduction in truck rental days and an reduction in truck t m revenue per day 
ancillary revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenues  rentals of gps navigation units  and sales of loss damage waivers and insurance products 
in addition  the total revenue increase includes million related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our international operations results into us dollars 
total expenses increased million due to i a  million charge recorded for the impairment of goodwill at each of our reporting units to reflect the decline in their fair value as evidenced by a decline in the market value of our common stock  ii a million increase in operating expense largely due to the increase in car rental days  iii an increase in vehicle depreciation and lease charges of million resulting from higher per unit vehicle costs and growth in our average car rental fleet and iv the adverse impact from foreign exchange currency rates of million 
the increase in expenses was offset by decreases principally due to the million charge for early extinguishment of debt incurred during and a million decrease in separation related costs 
the separation costs related primarily to severance  retention and legal  accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with the cendant separation 
we also experienced i a million reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses resulting mainly from unallocated corporate expense in related to the discontinued operations treatment of our former subsidiaries and ii million lower interest expense related to corporate debt  resulting from the repayment of approximately billion of such debt in third quarter as a result of these items and a million reduction in our benefit from income taxes  our loss from continuing operations increased million 
our effective tax rate for continuing operations were benefits of and for and  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rate for was primarily due to the non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge 
income loss from discontinued operations decreased million  which principally reflects the absence of net income generated by realogy  wyndham and travelport prior to the cendant separation  which was completed in the billion increase in gain loss on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax primarily represents the loss on disposal of discontinued operations in  partially offset by a tax benefit realized as a result of certain elections made in connection with the travelport disposition on the income tax returns filed during absent in were the non cash charges recorded in of million million  after tax to reflect the cumulative effect of accounting changes as a result of our adoption of i statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

in addition  ebitda for reflects unallocated corporate expenses related to discontinued operations 
following the completion of the cendant separation  we do not incur the majority of such costs 
c the amount in includes a million charge related to the early extinguishment of corporate debt

domestic car rental revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with we experienced increased demand for car rentals and significantly increased our ancillary revenues 
the revenue increase of million was comprised of a million increase in t m revenue and a million increase in ancillary revenues 
the increase in t m revenue was principally driven by a increase in rental days 
the million increase in ancillary revenues was due primarily to i a million increase in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenues  million of which was offset in ebitda by higher airport concession and vehicle licensing expenses remitted to airport and other regulatory authorities  ii a million increase in rentals of gps navigation units  sales of loss damage waivers and insurance products and other items  and iii an million increase in gasoline sales 
the favorable effect of incremental revenues was offset in ebitda by million of increased fleet depreciation and lease charges primarily resulting from increased per unit fleet costs in and a increase in average fleet 
ebitda also reflected a million increase in operating expenses including i million of additional expenses associated with increased car rental volume and fleet size  primarily related to credit card fees and agency operator commissions and ii million of incremental expenses  primarily representing inflationary increases in salaries and wages and off airport rental expense 
we incurred million more vehicle related interest expense during compared to  primarily due to the loss of intercompany interest income recorded in prior to the cendant separation 
ebitda also benefited from a million decrease in separation related costs  primarily related to accelerated vesting of stock based compensation awards incurred in international car rental revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with  primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  increased car rental pricing and higher demand for car rentals 
the revenue increase of million was comprised of a million increase in car rental t m revenue and a million increase in ancillary revenues 
the increase in t m revenue was principally driven by a increase in t m revenue per day and a increase in the number of days a car was rented 
the total growth in revenue includes a million increase related to the translation of foreign currency exchange rates  which increased t m revenue per day by and was largely offset in ebitda by the opposite impact on expenses and provided a net benefit of million year over year 
the million increase in ancillary revenues was due primarily to i a million increase in counter sales of insurance and other items  and ii a million increase in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenues  which was more than offset in ebitda by higher airport concession and vehicle licensing expenses remitted to airport and other regulatory authorities 
the favorable effect of incremental t m revenues was partially offset in ebitda by million of increased fleet depreciation and lease charges principally resulting from an increase of in the average size of our international rental fleet and increased per unit fleet costs including the effects of foreign exchange movements 
ebitda also reflects million of incremental operating expenses including i million in inflationary increases in salaries and wages  rents and other costs  ii million in additional expenses associated with increased car rental volume  primarily related to license and registration fees and other vehicle costs  and iii million in increased gasoline expenses 
we incurred million more interest expense during than in due to increased borrowings for international operations and higher interest rates 
truck rental revenues and ebitda declined million and million  respectively  in compared with  primarily reflecting decreases in rental day volume and t m revenue per day 
ebitda was also impacted by increased fleet costs 
substantially all of the revenue decrease was due to a decline in t m revenue  which reflected a reduction in rental days and an decrease in t m revenue per day 
the reduction in rental days resulted primarily from declines in one way consumer and commercial volumes  and a reduction in the average size or our rental fleet 
we believe these decreases reflect a soft housing market and heightened competition for commercial rentals 
despite the reduction in the average size of our truck rental fleet  we incurred million of incremental fleet depreciation  interest and lease charges primarily due to higher per unit fleet costs  including a reduction in expense of million due to a change in projected vehicle hold periods 
these items were offset by million in reduced operating expenses  including i a decrease of million in operating commission expense primarily reflecting the decrease in t m revenue  ii a million decrease in maintenance and damage costs  and iii an million reduction in insurance expense as a result of favorable claims experience and the reduction in rental days 
ebitda also reflected a million reduction in restructuring charges compared to and a year over year reduction of million in costs related to the cendant separation 
corporate and other revenues decreased million and ebitda increased from a loss of million in to an income of million in revenues were lower in due to i the absence of million in revenue associated with a credit card marketing program under which we earned fees based on a percentage of credit card spending through the date of the cendant separation  ii a million decrease in revenues earned for information technology service contracts with realogy  wyndham and travelport as the contracts expire and services are no longer being provided and iii a million reduction primarily related to dividend income and gains on the sale of marketable securities in ebitda increased primarily due to i a million reduction in selling and general expenses resulting from the spin offs of realogy and wyndham and the sale of travelport in third quarter  ii a million reduction in separation related expenses  including unallocated corporate costs  iii a million reduction in legal fees for litigation related to the former cuc business units and iv a million decrease in intercompany interest expense prior to the cendant separation 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we present separately the financial data of our vehicle programs 
these programs are distinct from our other activities as the assets under vehicle programs are generally funded through the issuance of debt that is collateralized by such assets 
the income generated by these assets is used  in part  to repay the principal and interest associated with the debt 
cash inflows and outflows relating to the generation or acquisition of such assets and the principal debt repayment or financing of such assets are classified as activities of our vehicle programs 
we believe it is appropriate to segregate the financial data of our vehicle programs because  ultimately  the source of repayment of such debt is the realization of such assets 
financial condition december  december  change total assets exclusive of assets under vehicle programs total liabilities exclusive of liabilities under vehicle programs assets under vehicle programs liabilities under vehicle programs stockholders equity total assets exclusive of assets under vehicle programs decreased approximately billion primarily due to i a charge of  million recorded in for the impairment to our goodwill  our tradenames asset within our other intangible assets  net and our equity investment in carey  ii a million decrease within other current assets for receivables due from realogy and wyndham  iii a million decrease in income taxes receivable  iv a million decrease in derivatives related to our vehicle debt driven by fluctuations in interest rates  and v a million decrease in accounts receivable

these decreases were partially offset by a net million increase in other non current liabilities  primarily related to a million increase in tax liabilities for which we are entitled to indemnification from realogy and wyndham and a million increase in long term income taxes payable 
assets under vehicle programs decreased million primarily due to i a million decrease in our net vehicles primarily due to the effect of foreign currency translations and ii a million decrease in our investment in avis budget rental car funding aesop llc primarily due to mark to market losses on derivatives 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in receivables for vehicles sold 
liabilities under vehicle programs increased million  reflecting million in additional borrowings  offset by an million decrease in invoices from manufacturers for vehicles received 
see liquidity and capital resources debt and financing arrangements for a detailed account of the change in our debt related to vehicle programs 
stockholders equity decreased approximately billion primarily due to i a net loss of  million  ii a million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income primarily as a result of currency translation adjustments  unrealized losses on interest rate hedges and the decrease in the fair value of our pension plan assets and iii the repurchase of approximately million of our common stock 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and our ability to generate cash through operations and financing activities  as well as available funding arrangements and committed credit facilities  each of which is discussed below

we used million more cash in investing activities during compared with this change primarily reflects the activities of our vehicle programs  which used approximately million more cash primarily due to the reduction in proceeds received on disposition of vehicles resulting from a reduction in vehicle dispositions 
additionally  there was million of incremental spending for acquisitions of vehicle rental franchises during  offset by the cash used in for our equity investment in carey 
during  we expect to utilize at least billion of cash to purchase rental vehicles  which will primarily be funded with proceeds received on the sale of rental vehicles to manufacturers under repurchase and guaranteed depreciation agreements or in the used vehicle market and our borrowings under our vehicle backed debt programs 
we anticipate aggregate capital expenditures will approximate million in we generated million more cash from financing activities during compared to this change primarily reflects i a million net increase in cash provided under our vehicle programs financing activities primarily due to reduced principal payments required on our vehicle backed debt and ii a million decrease in debt principal payments related to our corporate borrowings in these reductions in cash outflows were partially offset by an million net increase in cash utilized for the repurchases of common stock during versus cash received in for common stock issuances

liquidity risk our primary liquidity needs include the payment of operating expenses  servicing of corporate and vehicle related debt and procurement of rental vehicles to be used in our operations 
our primary sources of funding are operating revenue  cash received upon sale of vehicles  borrowings under our vehicle backed borrowing arrangements and our revolving credit facility 
our liquidity position has been and may be further negatively affected by the current financial market disruptions and the current downturn in the us and worldwide economies  which have resulted in and may result in further unfavorable conditions in the vehicle rental industry  in the asset backed financing market  and in the credit markets generally 
these factors have contributed to and could further contribute to changes in the debt ratings assigned to us by credit rating agencies and the cost of our borrowings 
additionally  the downturn in the us economy and the disruption in the credit markets could further impact our liquidity due to i decreased demand and pricing for vehicles in the used vehicle market  ii increased costs associated with  and or reduced capacity or increased collateral needs under  our financings  such as the increased costs  including additional collateral requirements  incurred in connection with recent amendments to our asset backed conduit facilities and increased costs and decreased capacity that resulted from recent amendments to our senior credit facilities  iii the adverse impact of any of the vehicle manufacturers  including general motors corporation  ford motor company  hyundai motor america  kia motors america or chrysler llc being unable or unwilling to honor its obligations to repurchase or guarantee the depreciation on the related program vehicles  iv any potential disruption to our ability to obtain financing due to negative credit events specific to us or affecting the overall debt market  including our ability to renew or replace our asset backed car rental conduit facilities as they mature in  v the impact of an actual or potential default by any of the financial guaranty firms that have insured a portion of our outstanding vehicle backed debt and vi the effect of any of realogy  wyndham or travelport being unable or unwilling to honor its obligations under the separation agreement 
our liquidity position also may be negatively affected if we are unable to remain in compliance with the financial and other covenants associated with our senior credit facilities and other borrowings 
the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes prohibits us from incurring additional debt  subject to certain exceptions 
we are currently unable to rely on the exception which requires compliance with an interest coverage ratio

accounting policies critical accounting policies in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events and or events that are outside of our control 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results 
however  our businesses operate in environments where we are paid a fee for a service performed  and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective  nor complex

a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause the fair value to be less than the respective carrying amount 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge  which would impact earnings 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are allocated among three reporting units 
during  a  million  million  net of tax charge was recorded to reflect i the impairment of goodwill  ii the impairment of our tradenames assets and iii the impairment of our investment in carey 
these charges reflect the decline in their fair value below their carrying value  primarily as a result of reduced market valuations for vehicle services and other companies  as well as reduced profit forecasts due to soft economic conditions and increased financing costs 
domestic car rental operations recorded million and international car rental recorded million  for goodwill and tradename impairment  truck rental recorded million for goodwill impairment and corporate and other recorded million for the charge related to our investment in carey 
the aggregate carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets was approximately million and million  respectively  at december  vehicles 
we present vehicles at cost  net of accumulated depreciation on the consolidated balance sheets 
we record the initial cost of the vehicle net of incentives and allowances from manufactures 
we acquire our rental vehicles either through repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs with certain automobile manufacturers or outside of such programs 
for rental vehicles purchased under such programs  we depreciate the vehicles such that the net book value on the date of sale or return to the manufacturers is intended to equal the contractual guaranteed residual values 
for vehicles acquired outside of manufacturer repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs  we depreciate based on the vehicles estimated residual market values and their expected dates of disposition 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent results of operations 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
currently the company does not record valuation allowances on the majority of its tax loss carryforwards as there are adequate deferred tax liabilities that could be realized within the carryforward period 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding income taxes 
financial instruments 
we estimate fair values for each of our financial instruments  including derivative instruments 
most of these financial instruments are not publicly traded on an organized exchange 
in the absence of quoted market prices  we must develop an estimate of fair value using dealer quotes  present value cash flow models  option pricing models or other conventional valuation methods  as appropriate 
the use of these fair value techniques involves significant judgments and assumptions  including estimates of future interest rate levels based on interest rate yield curves  credit spreads of the company and counterparties  volatility factors  and an estimation of the timing of future cash flows 
the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts recorded in the financial statements  which are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  hedge accounting requires that at the beginning of each hedge period  we justify an expectation that the relationship between the changes in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges compared to changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged items will be highly effective 
this effectiveness assessment  which is performed at least quarterly  involves an estimation of changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates  as well as the probability of the occurrence of transactions for cash flow hedges 
the use of different assumptions and changing market conditions may impact the results of the effectiveness assessment and ultimately the timing of when changes in derivative fair values and the underlying hedged items are recorded in earnings 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of the effect of hypothetical changes to these assumptions 
public liability  property damage and other insurance liabilities  net 
insurance liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets include additional liability insurance  personal effects protection insurance  public liability  property damage and personal accident insurance claims for which we are self insured 
we estimate the required liability of such claims on an undiscounted basis utilizing an actuarial method that is based upon various assumptions which include  but are not limited to  our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors 
the required liability is also subject to adjustment in the future based upon changes in claims experience  including changes in the number of incidents and changes in the ultimate cost per incident

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use various financial instruments  particularly swap contracts  futures and options contracts  to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related specifically to our debt 
foreign currency forwards are also used to manage and reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated receivables and forecasted royalties  forecasted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and other transactions 
we also use derivative commodity instruments to manage and reduce the risk of changing unleaded gasoline prices 
we are exclusively an end user of these instruments  which are commonly referred to as derivatives 
we do not engage in trading  market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
more detailed information about these financial instruments is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our principal market exposures are interest and foreign currency rate risks 
our primary interest rate exposure at december  was to interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically libor and commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we anticipate that libor and commercial paper rates will remain a primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we have foreign currency rate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations worldwide and particularly with respect to the australian dollar  british pound  canadian dollar and the new zealand dollar 
we anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we have commodity price exposure related to fluctuations in the price of unleaded gasoline 
we anticipate that such commodity risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact in earnings  fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates 
we use a duration based model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts on our debt portfolio and interest rate derivative portfolios 
the primary assumption used in this model is that a increase or decrease in the benchmark interest rate produces a parallel shift in the yield curve across all maturities 
our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented 
while probably the most meaningful analysis  these shock tests are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
we used december   and market rates on outstanding financial instruments to perform the sensitivity analyses separately for each of our market risk exposures 
the estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates 
we have determined that the impact of a change in interest rates exposure would not have a material impact on our operating income  fair values and cash flows 
we have determined that the impact of a change in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices on our earnings  fair values and cash flows would not be material 
while these results may be used as benchmarks  they should not be viewed as forecasts
