all financial information is presented in us dollars 
some of the statements set forth in this section are forward looking statements relating to our future results of operations 
our actual results may vary from the results anticipated by these statements 
please see information concerning forward looking statements on page 
table of contents overview our mission is to make the internet easier and more effective for users 
we accomplish this by reducing the complexity our customers experience as they acquire  deliver or use internet services such as domain name registration  hosted email and other internet services 
our primary distribution channel is a global distribution network of more than  resellers  in more than countries who offer our services to their own customers 
this distribution channel is comprised primarily of web hosting companies  isps  and other providers of internet services who typically provide their customers  the end users of the internet  with a critical component for establishing and maintaining an online presence 
we also offer internet services to consumers and small businesses through our retail web sites at hover 
com 
in addition  we hold a domain name portfolio that is available for sale or lease  the generation of revenue as part of our pay per click advertising program and support our personalized email programs through our portfolio of surname based domain names 
tucows 
com remains one of the most popular software download sites on the internet 
our business model has been characterized by non refundable  up front payments  which lead to recurring revenue and positive operating cash flow 
we are an accredited registrar with icann and manage over nine million domains 
net revenues we generate net revenues primarily through the provision of domain registration and other internet services 
additional revenue is generated from the sale of domain names and advertising and other services 
to assist us in forecasting growth and to help us monitor the effectiveness of our operational strategies we categorize our revenue as follows traditional domain registration services historically traditional domain registration has been the largest portion of our business and encompasses all of our services as an accredited registrar related to the registration  renewal  transfer and management of domain names through our global reseller distribution network 
we also provide resellers with the ability to sell personal names 
this service allows resellers the opportunity to sell email addresses based on our domain portfolio of surname domain names 
in addition  traditional domain registration fuels other revenue categories as it often is the initial service for which a customer will engage us  enabling us to follow on with other services  and it allows us to add to our domain portfolio by purchasing names registered through us  once they expire 
on august   in advance of the announced october registry fee increases  we modified our pricing structure for traditional domain names to provide greater visibility into the various fees that make up the cost of a domain name  by breaking out the cost of the registry and icann fees separately from our management fee 
the management fee provides our resellers with access to our provisioning and management tools to enable them to register and administer domain names and access to additional services like whois privacy and managed dns services  enhanced domain name suggestion tools and access to our premium domain name services 
as of december   we offer registration services for the gtlds

with respect to the sale of domain registrations  we earn fees in connection with each new  renewed and transferred in registration and from providing provisioning services to resellers and registrars on a monthly basis 
domain registrations are generally purchased for terms of one to ten 
table of contents years  with a majority having a one year term 
except for certain large customers with whom we have negotiated alternative arrangements  payments for the full term of service  or billed revenue  is received at the time of activation of service 
all fees received in connection with domain name registration are non refundable and where appropriate are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as earned ratably over the term of provision of service 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the quarters and the year 
domain portfolio services we derive revenue from our domain name portfolio of tens of thousands of domain names by making them available as part of our pay per click advertising or parked pages program and by making them available for sale or lease 
parked pages are domain names registered with us that do not yet contain an active website 
when a user types one of these domain names into the command line of the browser direct navigation  they are presented with dynamically generated links which are pay per click advertising 
every time a user clicks on one of the links listed on a web page  it generates revenue for us through our partnership with third parties who provide syndicated pay per click results 
portfolio names are sold through our premium domain name service  auctions or in negotiated sales 
the size of our domain name portfolio varies over time  as we acquire and sell domains on a regular basis to maximize the overall value and revenue generation potential of our portfolio 
in evaluating these names for sale  we consider the potential foregone revenue from pay per click advertising as well as other factors 
the name will be offered for sale if  based on our evaluation  the name is deemed non essential to our business  and management believes that deriving proceeds from this sale is strategically more beneficial to the company 
portfolio names that have been acquired from third parties or through acquisition are included as intangible assets with indefinite lives on our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  we also offer the same services to our customers allowing them to make available names registered by them for monetization on a similar basis 
for customer names  in the case of premium names or names sold or leased  we earn a referral fee while for names offered through our pay per click advertising program we participate on a revenue share basis 
we recognize revenue from these services  net of any fees payable to resellers or customers  immediately upon completion of the service or in the case of advertising from direct navigation  on a monthly basis once the advertising has been served 
email services we derive revenue from our hosted email service through our global distribution network 
our email service is offered on a per account per month basis  and provides resellers with a reliable  scalable white label email hosting solution that can be customized to their branding and business model requirements 
the email service also includes spam and virus filtering on all accounts 
end users can access the email service via a full featured multi language ajax enabled web interface  a wap mobile interface  or through traditional desktop email clients  such as microsoft outlook or apple mail  using imap or pop smtp and gb of mail storage 
we earn fees for email services when they are activated 
email services are generally purchased monthly and at month end  are either deducted  on a pre authorized basis  from reseller s deposit account or are invoiced 
retail services we generate revenues from the provisioning and management of internet services  on a retail basis  to consumers and small businesses through our hover 
com website 
these services include domain registration and other internet services such as email and personalized email through our portfolio of surname based domain names as well as an easy to use interface that allows users to connect domain 
table of contents names to websites and email addresses through a unique dns forwarding system that allows users to create short  easy to share links from a domain name to any web page on the internet 
depending on the service offered  we typically receive standard fees for our services  for which fees are published on the website 
our customers generally purchase services for terms of one to ten years  with a majority having a one year term and some services being offered on a monthly basis 
payments for the full term of all services  or billed revenue  are received at the time of activation of service and  where appropriate  are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as earned ratably over the term of provision of service 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the quarters and the year 
other services other internet services currently consist of digital certificates  billing  provisioning and customer care software solutions  blogware and website building tools which are used by our resellers to create bundles of internet services for their end users 
we earn fees when a service is activated 
other internet services are generally purchased for terms of one month to three years 
payments for other internet services are for the full term of all services at the time of activation of service and  where appropriate  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as earned ratably over the term of the provision of service 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the quarters and the year 
we also generate advertising and other revenue  or content revenue  through our online libraries of shareware  freeware and online services presented at our websites  tucows 
com and butterscotch 
com 
our software libraries advertising revenue is generated from third party advertisers and from software developers who rely on us as a primary source of distribution 
software developers use our author resource center  or arc  to submit their products for inclusion in our software libraries and to purchase promotional placement of their software in the library categories 
software developers may also use our arc to purchase other promotional services on a cost per click through or flat rate basis 
software developers are able to promote their software through advertising services including keyword search placements  banners  promotional placements  expedited reviews and premium data services 
revenue is also generated from companies that contract with us to provide them with co branded content 
advertising and other revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which it is presented 
butterscotch 
com derives revenue from banner and text advertising on the site as well as video advertising and product placement within the videos that make up the bulk of the site 
additionally  revenue is earned through custom video production for technology manufacturers and internet services 
advertising and other revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which it is presented 
to the extent that the minimum number of impressions we guarantee to customers is not met  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenues until the guaranteed impressions are achieved 
custom video production revenue is recognized on acceptance of the completed video by the customer 
critical accounting policies the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and methods 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties made by management that may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   or fiscal  includes 
table of contents further information on the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the application of these estimates  including those related to the recoverability of investments  useful lives and valuation of intangible assets  valuation of goodwill  fair value measurement of assets and liabilities  product development costs  revenue recognition and deferred revenue and accounting for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition policy we earn revenues from the following services  traditional domain registration services  domain portfolio services  email services  retail services  and other services 
with respect to the sale of domain registrations and other internet services  we earn registration fees in connection with each new  renewed and transferred in registration and from providing provisioning services to resellers and registrars on a monthly basis 
we also enter into revenue arrangements in which a reseller may purchase a combination of services multiple element arrangements 
when fair value exists for all elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements 
fair value is established by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
for arrangements where fair value exists only for the undelivered elements  we defer the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue  related to the delivered items  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
payments for the full term of all services  or billed revenue  are received at the time of activation of service and where appropriate are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as earned ratably over the term of provision of service 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the quarters and the year 
revenue from the sale of domain names consists primarily of amounts earned for the transfer of rights to domain names that are currently under the company s control 
collectability of revenues generated is subject to a high level of uncertainty  accordingly revenues are recognized only as received 
we also generate advertising and other revenue through our online libraries of shareware  freeware and online services presented at our website  tucows 
com 
advertising and other revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which it is presented 
to the extent that the minimum number of impressions we guarantee to customers is not met  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenues until the guaranteed impressions are achieved 
custom video production revenue is recognized on acceptance of the completed video by the customer 

table of contents changes to contractual relationships in the future could impact the amounts and timing of revenue recognition 
in those cases where payment is not received at the time of sale  additional conditions for recognition of revenue apply 
the conditions are i that the collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and ii that we have no further performance obligations 
we record expected refunds  rebates and credit card charge backs as a reduction of revenues at the time of the sale based on historical experiences and current expectations 
should these expectations not be met  adjustments will be required in future periods 
we establish reserves for possible uncollectible accounts receivable and other contingent liabilities which may arise in the normal course of business 
historically  credit losses have been within our expectations and the reserves we have established have been appropriate 
however  we have  on occasion  experienced issues which have led to accounts receivable not being fully collected 
should these issues occur more frequently  additional reserves may be required 
valuation of intangible assets  goodwill and long lived assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair values assigned to the net assets acquired in business combinations 
intangible assets consist of acquired technology  brand  customer relationships  non competition agreements  surname domain names and direct navigation domain names 
intangible assets  comprising technology  brand value  customer relationships and non competition arrangements related to the acquisition of boardtown corporation in april  the acquisition of the hosted messaging business of critical path  inc in january  the acquisition of mailbank 
com inc in june and the acquisition of innerwise  inc 
in june  are being amortized on a straight line basis over periods of two to seven years 
we account for goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which provides that goodwill and indefinite life intangibles should not be amortized  but shall be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount 
sfas requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually at the same time every year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
we review goodwill at least annually for possible impairment in the fourth quarter of each year 
we have other finite life intangible assets consisting of patented and non patented technologies 
these intangible assets are amortized over their expected economic lives 
the lives are determined based upon the expected use of the asset  the estimated average life of the replacement parts of the reporting units products  the stability of the industry  expected changes in and replacement value of distribution networks and other factors deemed appropriate 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its definite life intangible assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable 
there was no impairment recorded on definite life intangible assets and other long lived assets during and determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions  and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
the long term financial forecast 
table of contents represents the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable 
however  actual performance in the near term and longer term could be materially different from these forecasts  which could impact future estimates of fair value of our reporting units and may result in a charge to earnings in future periods due to the potential for a write down of goodwill in connection with such tests 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
effective january   we adopted financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin requires a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit to assess if the amount is more than likely to be realized upon settlement 
as we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas  we recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the anticipated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  historical and future levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies are considered 
in the event that it is determined that the deferred tax assets to be realized in the future would be in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded 
this adjustment would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should it be determined that all or part of a recorded net deferred tax asset would not be realized in the future  an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination would be made 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate the probability that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered to assess its realizability 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we will increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future taxable income 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  impacting net income or net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
accounting for stock based employee compensation on january   we adopted the fair value based method for measurement and cost recognition of employee stock based compensation arrangements under the provisions of sfas r  
table of contents share based payment  using the modified prospective application transitional approach 
previously  we had elected to account for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method based upon accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees or apb and related interpretations 
the intrinsic value method generally did not result in any compensation cost being recorded for employee stock options since the exercise price was equal to the market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
under the modified prospective application transitional approach  stock based compensation is recognized for awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled subsequent to the date of adoption of sfas r 
in addition  stock based compensation is recognized  subsequent to the date of adoption of sfas r  for the remaining portion of unvested outstanding awards granted prior to the date of adoption 
prior periods have not been adjusted and we continue to provide pro forma disclosure as if it had accounted for employee share based payments in all periods prior to the adoption of sfas r in accordance with the fair value provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  which is presented below 
we measure stock based compensation costs on the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award 
we have elected to treat awards with graded vesting as a single award when estimating fair value 
compensation cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the employee requisite service period  which in our circumstance is the stated vesting period of the award  provided that total compensation cost recognized at least equals the pro rata value of the award that has vested 
compensation cost is initially based on the estimated number of options for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 
this estimate is adjusted to the vesting date once actual forfeitures are known 
refer to note stock option plans in these consolidated financial statements for details of stock options and stock based compensation cost recorded during fiscal results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  net revenues the following table presents our net revenues  by revenue source year ended december  traditional domain registration services domain portfolio services email services retail services other services increase over prior period increase percentage 
table of contents the following table presents our revenues  by revenue source  as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  traditional domain registration services domain portfolio services email services retail services other services total net revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  or fiscal deferred revenue from domain name registrations and other internet services at december  increased to million from million at december  no customer accounted for more than of revenue during fiscal and at december   two customers accounted for of accounts receivable 
significant management judgment is required at the time of recording of revenue to assess whether the collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
on an ongoing basis  we assess the ability of our customers to make required payments 
based on this assessment  we expect the carrying amount of our outstanding receivables  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  to be fully collected 
traditional domain registration services net revenues from traditional domain registration services for fiscal compared to fiscal increased by million  or  to million 
this increase was primarily as a result of increased volumes from new and existing customers 
the market for domain name and other internet services remains intensely competitive and rapidly evolving 
effective august  as part of our ongoing initiatives to improve our competitive position and to provide wholesale domain resellers a transparent cost breakdown  we invested in a new cost plus domain pricing structure and a reduction in our domain name pricing 
these steps have contributed to our average selling price declining and are likely to adversely impact our revenue and profitability in the short term 
they also may or may not result in increased volumes  which would adversely impact our revenues and profitability in the longer term 
during fiscal  the number of domain names that we processed increased by million to million new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations  compared to fiscal this increase resulted primarily from our continuing to compete aggressively to attract new clients and retain existing customers and from the incremental registrations we generated as a result of our acquisition of its your domain  or iyd  in july while we anticipate that the number of new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations will continue to incrementally increase  the volatility in the market could affect the growth of domain names under our management 
at december   the total number of domain names under our management increased by million to million  compared to the total number of domain names under our management as at december   partly as a result of the names we acquired in our acquisition of iyd in july as of december   we provided provisioning services on a monthly basis to accredited registrars who use our technical systems to process domain registrations with their own accreditation 
as of december   we managed an incremental million domain names on behalf of other accredited registrars  compared to million for accredited registrars at december  
table of contents domain portfolio services net revenues from our domain portfolio services for fiscal compared to fiscal decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease resulted primarily from sales of names from our portfolio of domain names amounting to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal these fiscal sales included  during the fiscal quarter ended june   an atypically large sale of million representing approximately  domain names 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase of million in the revenue we earned from the delivery of third party advertisements on parked pages during fiscal compared to fiscal the market for monetization of domain names is rapidly evolving and there is no guarantee that we will be able to grow revenue  nor that we will be able to continue to acquire the same caliber of names for our portfolio from future expiring domains or that names we acquire in future will provide the same revenue impact as in past acquisitions 
email services net revenues from email services for fiscal compared to fiscal decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease resulted primarily from our elimination of certain enterprise customers that were acquired as part of the hosted messaging business of critical path in january that were not part of our strategic focus and who were receiving pricing that was not competitive in the marketplace 
since our primary interest is in the reseller customers in the critical path  inc customer base  we felt the proper course of action would be for us to continue to support enterprise customers for as long as they choose to utilize our service and to assist any enterprise customer who wished to migrate either in house or to another supplier 
in addition  during fiscal  we began investing in the re architecture of our email service due to the inefficiencies in the older platform we had purchased from critical path  inc these inefficiencies were undermining our customers experience  were increasing our customer support incidents and were limiting our ability to close new business 
as a result of the above factors  during fiscal  we had four significant customers  who contributed approximately to our current monthly email service revenue  leave 
three of these customers are media portal companies who have become more focused on controlling costs 
email is a small component of their service offerings and for competitive and cost control reasons they are choosing to allow their email services to be included in larger supply contracts 
this resulted in one of these customers migrating off of our hosted email platform during the three months ended september  and two of the other customers notifying us of their intention to leave our platform in the near future 
while the loss of our customer in september did not materially impact our results for fiscal  if our efforts to actively market our email service to new customers are not successful in offsetting these customer losses  we expect that the loss of these customers may have a material impact on our results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  or fiscal retail services net revenues from retail services for fiscal compared to fiscal increased by million  or  to million 
the primary contributors to this increase were the recognition of million of deferred revenue as a result of the sale of our remaining retail hosting customers  an increase of million from our provisioning of personalized email through our portfolio of surname based domain names through the netidentity website and an increase of million from retail domain registration and other internet services as a result of the iyd acquisition 

table of contents other services other services currently include revenue from digital certificates  billing  provisioning and customer care software solutions  blogware and website building tools  and other internet services  which are used by our resellers to create bundles of internet services for their end users and content 
other revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease was primarily the result of a decline in content revenue of million being offset by increases in other internet services 
the decrease in content revenue primarily reflects the contraction in the yields from our syndicated google feeds  and to a lesser extent  slower advertising through our website 
cost of revenues cost of revenues includes the costs associated with providing domain registration and for providing our portfolio  email  retail and other services as well as network costs 
cost of revenues for traditional domain registrations represents the amortization of registry fees on a basis consistent with the recognition of revenues from our customers  namely ratably over the term of provision of the service 
registry fees  the primary component of cost of revenues  are paid in full when the domain is registered and are initially recorded as prepaid domain registry fees 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the fiscal quarters and the fiscal year 
costs of revenues for domain portfolio services represent the amortization of registry fees for domains added to our portfolio over the renewal period which is generally one year  the value ascribed under intangible assets to any domain name sold and any impairment charges that may arise from our assessment of the domain name intangible assets 
payments for domain registrations are payable for the full term of service at the time of activation of the service and are recorded as prepaid cost of goods sold and are expensed ratably over the term of provision of the service 
cost of revenues for email services are payable to third party providers for licensing and royalty costs payable on certain components of our email service offering they provide 
fees payable for these components are included in the cost of revenues in the month they are incurred 
costs of revenues for retail services include the amortization of registry fees on a basis consistent with the recognition of revenues from our customers  namely ratably over the term of provision of the service  and includes the amortization of registry fees payable to renew the domains in our surname portfolio 
registry fees  the primary component of cost of revenues  are paid in full when the domain is registered and are recorded as prepaid domain registry fees 
cost of revenues for retail services also includes monthly license fees payable for hosting services 
costs of revenues for other services include the fees paid to third party service providers  primarily for digital certificates and printing services in connection with our billing  provisioning and customer care software solutions 
fees payable for digital certificates are amortized on a basis consistent with the provision of service  generally one year 
monthly printing fees are included in the cost of revenues in the month they are incurred 
network costs include personnel and related expenses  depreciation and amortization  communication costs  equipment maintenance  stock based compensation and employee and related costs directly associated with the management and maintenance of our network 
communication costs include bandwidth  co location and provisioning costs we incur to support the supply of all our services 

table of contents the following table presents our cost of revenues  by revenue source  for the periods presented year ended december  traditional domain registration services domain portfolio services email services retail services other services network  other costs network  depreciation and amortization costs increase over prior period increase percentage the following table presents our cost of revenues  as a percentage of total cost of revenues for the periods presented year ended december  traditional domain registration services domain portfolio services email services retail services other services network  other costs network  depreciation and amortization costs cost of revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal costs for traditional domain registration services increased by million as a result of higher volumes of domain registrations and our responding to the continuing competitive nature of the domain name market 
costs for domain portfolio services increased by million  primarily as a result of the amortization of renewal costs of domain names in our portfolio of generic domain names  which are recognized ratably over the term of the renewal 
retail and other services costs increased by million essentially as a result of increased volumes and a decrease in network costs of million 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million in costs for email services  which reflect lower licensing and royalty costs payable to third party service providers 
network costs for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease resulted from the lower support contract and people costs of million that we incurred during fiscal that were primarily attributable to the closure and relocation of certain of our co location facilities during september and a decrease in depreciation and amortization costs for fiscal of million  to million  primarily as a result of our retiring certain of our older computer hardware that was replaced with cheaper and more efficient hardware 
these decreases were offset by the effect of a reversal of a contingency of million that was accrued in march for a planned network operation initiative that we did not pursue 
amortization of intangible assets consists of amounts arising in connection with the acquisition of technology from each of the boardtown corporation in april  the hosted messaging business of critical path  inc in january  mailbank 
com inc 
in june and innerwise inc in july 
table of contents the technology purchased in connection with the acquisition of boardtown corporation is amortized on a straight line basis over seven years  and for innerwise inc over three years  while the technology acquired in connection with each of the acquisitions of the hosted messaging assets of critical path  inc and the in house software of mailbank 
com inc is amortized on a straight line basis over two years 
prepaid domain registration and other internet services fees at december  increased by million  or  to million 
while we expect cost of sales to increase as a result of transactional volumes and the competitive and general business environment during fiscal  network costs are expected to decrease as we realize the full year benefits of our reduced overall footprint in our relocated data centers 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs 
these costs include commissions and related expenses of our sales  product management  public relations  call center  support and marketing personnel 
other sales and marketing expenses include customer acquisition costs  advertising and other promotional costs 
year ended december  sales and marketing increase over prior period increase percentage percentage of net revenues sales and marketing expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million  compared to million during fiscal the increase during fiscal was primarily attributable to a reversal in fiscal of a contingency of million that was accrued for certain marketing initiatives that we did not pursue and an increase in people costs of million  predominantly in customer service  as we continue to invest in customer service improvements to support our domain portfolio services 
we believe that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we adjust our marketing programs and sales and customer support strategies to meet future opportunities in the marketplace 
technical operations and development technical operations and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and related expenses required to support the development of new or enhanced service offerings and the maintenance and upgrading of existing infrastructure 
this includes expenses incurred in the research  design and development of technology that we use to register domain names  email  retail  domain portfolio and other internet services  as well as to distribute our digital content services 
editorial costs relating to the rating and review of the software content libraries are included in the costs of product development 
in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and primarily include personnel 
table of contents costs for employees directly related to the development project 
all other costs are expensed as incurred 
year ended december  technical operations and development decrease over prior period decrease percentage percentage of net revenues technical operations and development expenses for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million compared to million during fiscal this decrease during fiscal resulted primarily from a decrease of million in people related costs  including contract and outside service costs  principally as a result of the lower investment we need to make in the multiple systems that we are in the process of consolidating 
in addition  during fiscal  we incurred million in transitional costs relating to the acquisition of innerwise  inc we expect technical operations and development expenses to decrease slightly  in absolute dollars  going forward as a result of a corporate reorganization undertaken during fiscal general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for managerial and administrative personnel  fees for professional services  public listing expenses  rent and other general corporate expenses 
year ended december  general and administrative increase over prior period increase percentage percentage of net revenues general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million compared to million during fiscal the increase during fiscal resulted primarily from our recording a foreign exchange loss of million compared to a gain of million during fiscal this increase arose primarily as a result of the impact of translating our non us dollars to our functional currency of us dollars 
the significant weakness that the canadian dollar experienced during fiscal relative to the us dollar was the main contributor to this variance 
in addition to these translation losses  we have reclassified and separately disclosed the loss in the fair value of our unrealized forward exchange contracts 
in addition  during fiscal  we incurred incremental costs of million in expenses  such as legal and accounting fees  credit card processing fees and other miscellaneous expenses  when compared to fiscal these incremental costs were offset by a decrease in people and insurance costs of million during fiscal  when compared to fiscal we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease  in absolute dollars  as a result of an initiative we introduced in early fiscal to recover payment processing fees 
this will be partly offset by the foreign exchange impact that we expect to incur on the translation of our canadian dollar designated expenses and net assets

our goal with regard to foreign currency exposure is  to the extent possible  to achieve operational cost certainty and to manage financial exposure to certain foreign exchange fluctuations to neutralize some of the impact of foreign currency exchange movements 
accordingly  we enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the exchange rate risk on portions of our canadian dollar exposure 
as we do not comply with the documentation requirements for hedge accounting  we account for the fair value of the derivative instruments within the consolidated balance sheet as a derivative financial asset or liability and the corresponding change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
we have entered into forward exchange contracts during fiscal to meet our canadian dollar requirements for fiscal the impact of the fair value adjustment on unrealized foreign exchange on these contracts for fiscal was a net loss of million  and for fiscal  the impact was a net gain of million 
the fiscal net loss will fluctuate during fiscal in line with movements in the canadian vs 
us dollar pair 
as all of our fiscal contracts will have matured during the course of fiscal  the million reflected on our balance sheet as a derivative instrument liability at december  will reverse in full during fiscal and will result in our recognizing a non cash gain of million 
this gain will  however  be impacted by any additional contracts  with maturity dates after december   that we may enter into 
other income and expenses year ended december  other income  net increase over prior period increase percentage percentage of net revenues other income increased by million  to million compared to fiscal interest income decreased to  during fiscal compared to  during fiscal and reflects our lower cash balance 
the principal reasons for our lower cash balance resulted from our repayment of the promissory notes issued in association with the acquisition of mailbank 
com inc in june of million  as well as our making an annual cash sweep payment of million in may pursuant to the terms of our bank of montreal credit facility 
in connection with the promissory notes and the bank of montreal credit facility we also incurred an interest expense of million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal as part of our goal of divesting certain non strategic assets  during fiscal  we sold our retail shared hosting assets

in  we assigned to an unrelated third party various patents which were acquired by us in our merger with infonautics corporation in in connection with the assignment of these patents  we retained the right to share in certain revenue relating to any cash flow received by such third party relating to the commercialization of these patents 
as a result of this assignment  in june  we recognized million in other revenue 
this amount was fully paid to us during the quarter 
we do not expect to receive any additional revenue from this arrangement in the future 
during june and september  afilias limited  or afilias  a company in which we hold an investment  declared and paid two dividends of million each

income taxes the following table presents our provision for income taxes  and effective tax rate for the periods presented year ended december  provision for recovery of income taxes increase in provision over prior period increase percentage percentage of net revenues our provision for income taxes primarily relates to our estimate for federal alternative minimum tax obligations for fiscal and pennsylvania state franchise tax related to prior years 
no provision for income taxes other than for alternative minimum tax and pennsylvania franchise tax has been recorded during the year because we had net operating losses to offset against our operating income in our major operating jurisdictions 
we operate in various tax jurisdictions  and accordingly  our income is subject to varying rates of tax 
losses incurred in one jurisdiction cannot be used to offset income taxes payable in another 
our ability to use income tax loss carryforwards and future income tax deductions is dependant upon our operations in the tax jurisdictions in which such losses or deductions arise

the unrecognized tax benefit for for the research and development claim is not expected to be significant 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to taxes in tax expense 
we did not have any interest and penalties accrued as of december  and december  we believe it is reasonably possible that  of the unrecognized tax benefit will decrease in the next twelve months as it is anticipated that the canadian tax authorities will conclude their review of the company s and research and development claim for the credits and the us tax authorities will finalize their review of prior taxes owing in pennsylvania within the period

significant management judgment is required at the time of recording of revenue to assess whether the collection of the resulting 
table of contents receivables is reasonably assured 
on an ongoing basis we assess the ability of our customers to make required payments 
based on this assessment  we expect the carrying amount of our outstanding receivables  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  to be fully collected 
traditional domain registration services net revenues from traditional domain registration services for fiscal compared to fiscal increased by million  or  to million 
this increase was primarily as a result of increased volumes from new and existing customers 
the market for domain name and other internet services remains intensely competitive and rapidly evolving 
effective august  as part of our ongoing initiatives to improve our competitive position and to provide wholesale domain resellers a transparent cost breakdown  we invested in a new cost plus domain pricing structure and a reduction in our domain name pricing 
these steps have contributed to our average selling price declining and are likely to adversely impact our revenue and profitability in the short term 
they also may or may not result in increased volumes  which would adversely impact our revenues and profitability in the longer term 
during fiscal  the number of domain names that we processed increased by  to million new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations  compared to fiscal this increase resulted primarily from our continuing to compete aggressively to attract new clients and retain existing customers and by the incremental registrations we generated as a result of our acquisition of its your domain  or iyd  in july while we anticipate that the number of new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations will incrementally increase  the volatility in the market could affect the growth of domain names under our management 
at december   the total number of domain names under our management increased by million to million  compared to the total number of domain names under our management as at december  partly as a result of the names we acquired in our acquisition of iyd in july as of december   we provided provisioning services on a monthly basis to accredited registrars who use our technical systems to process domain registrations with their own accreditation 
as a result of the insolvency of one of our accredited registrars during fiscal   of the names we had under management for this registrar have now transferred to another registrar 
as of december   we managed an incremental million domain names on behalf of other accredited registrars  compared to million inclusive of the  names from the insolvent registrar for accredited registrars at december  domain portfolio services net revenues from our domain portfolio services for fiscal compared to fiscal increased by million  or  to million 
this increase resulted primarily from sales of names from our portfolio of domain names amounting to million during fiscal these sales included a million sale of approximately  domain names during the fiscal quarter ended june  in addition  the revenue we earned from the delivery of third party advertisements on parked pages during fiscal increased by million  or  to million 
the market for monetization of domain names is rapidly evolving and there is no guarantee that we will be able to grow revenue at the rate achieved in fiscal  nor that we will be able to continue to acquire the same caliber of names for our portfolio from future expiring domains or that names we acquire in future will provide the same revenue impact as past acquisitions 
email services net revenues from email services for fiscal compared to fiscal decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease resulted primarily from our losing enterprise customers that were acquired as part of hosted messaging business of critical path  inc in january that were not part of our strategic focus and who were receiving pricing that was not competitive 
table of contents in the marketplace 
since our primary interest is in the reseller customers in the critical path  inc customer base  we felt the proper course of action would be for us to continue to support enterprise customers for as long as they choose to utilize our service and to assist any enterprise customer who wished to migrate either in house or to another supplier to do so 
retail services net revenues from retail services for fiscal compared to fiscal increased by million  or  to million 
the primary contributor to this increase was an increase of million from our provisioning personalized email through our portfolio of surname based domain names through the netidentity website 
as this website was acquired as part of the mailbank 
com inc acquisition in june  fiscal was the first full year of our offering this service 
we also saw increased revenue from retail domain registration and other internet services of million  the result of a combination of acquisitions and organic growth 
other services other services currently include revenue from digital certificates  billing  provisioning and customer care software solutions  blogware and website building tools  or other internet services  which are used by our resellers to create bundles of internet services for their end users and content 
other revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease was primarily the result of a decline in content of million being offset by increases in other internet services  mainly in digital certificates  blogware and billing  provisioning and customer care software solutions 
the decrease in content revenue primarily reflects the contraction in the yields from our syndicated google feeds and to a lesser extent slower advertising through our website 
cost of revenues cost of revenues includes the costs associated with providing domain registration  other internet services  the costs of domain name sales  advertising and other revenue and network costs 
cost of revenues for traditional domain registrations represents the amortization of registry fees on a basis consistent with the recognition of revenues from our customers  namely ratably over the term of provision of the service 
registry fees  the primary component of cost of revenues  are paid in full when the domain is registered  and are initially recorded as prepaid domain registry fees 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the quarters and the year 
costs of revenues for domain portfolio services represent the amortization of registry fees for domains added to our portfolio over the renewal period which is generally one year  the value ascribed under intangible assets to any domain name sold and any impairment charges that may arise from our assessment of the domain name intangible assets 
as the total names in our portfolio continue to grow this will become a more significant component of our cost of revenues 
payments for domain registrations are payable for the full term of service at the time of activation of service and are recorded as prepaid cost of goods sold and are expensed ratably over the term of provision of service 
costs of revenues for retail services include the amortization of registry fees on a basis consistent with the recognition of revenues from our customers  namely ratably over the term of provision of the service and includes the amortization of registry fees payable to renew the domains in our surname portfolio

costs for domain portfolio services increased by million  primarily the result of the amortization of renewal costs of domain names in our portfolio of generic domain names  which are recognized ratably over the term of the renewal 
retail and other services costs increased by million essentially as a result of increased volumes and network costs increased by million 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million in costs for email services  which reflect lower licensing and royalty costs payable to third party service providers 
network costs for fiscal increased by million  or  to million 
this increase was primarily the result of the additional labor  bandwidth and co location costs of million that we incurred as we continue to carry multiple systems at our data centers and includes the  of transitional costs relating to the transfer of operational knowledge from critical path inc employees  in 
table of contents connection with the acquisition of the hosted messaging assets of critical path  inc that we incurred in fiscal these increases were offset in part by a reversal in march of a contingency of million that was accrued for a planned network operation initiative that the company did not pursue 
additional depreciation of million relating to information technology assets and increased amortization of million relating to our acquisitions  also contributed to the increased cost of revenues 
the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenue was primarily the result of the proportionately greater network costs incurred to support and manage our expanded internet service offerings  most notably our hosted email platform 
amortization of intangible assets consists of amounts arising in connection with the acquisition of technology from each of the boardtown corporation in april  the hosted messaging business of critical path  inc in january  mailbank

com inc is amortized on a straight line basis over two years 
prepaid domain registration and other internet services fees at december  increased by million  or  to million 
we expect network costs to increase as our network expands geographically and network activity increases 
these increases will be partially offset during fiscal as we begin the process of rationalizing some of the multiple systems we support and thereby reducing our overall footprint at our data centers

year ended december  sales and marketing increase over prior period increase percentage percentage of net revenues sales and marketing expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million  compared to million during fiscal the increase during fiscal was primarily the result of additional people costs of million  predominantly in customer service and marketing as we continue to invest in customer service improvements 
these increases were partially offset by our incurring lower traveling costs of million as our united kingdom office becomes more effective 
we believe that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we adjust our marketing programs and sales and customer support strategies to meet future opportunities in the marketplace 
technical operations and development technical operations and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and related expenses required to support the development of new or enhanced service offerings and the

in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and primarily include personnel costs for employees directly related to the development project 
all other costs are expensed as incurred 
year ended december  technical operations and development decrease over prior period decrease percentage percentage of net revenues technical operations and development expenses for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million compared to million during fiscal this decrease during fiscal primarily resulted from people related costs  including contract and outside service costs  decreasing by million  principally as a result of the steps we took to streamline our operations in flint  michigan and the lower investment we need to make in the multiple systems that we are in the process of consolidating 
in addition  during fiscal we did not incur any transitional costs relating to the acquisition of the hosted messaging assets of critical path  inc compared to million during fiscal these decreases were partially offset by our incurring million in transitional costs relating to the acquisition of innerwise  inc during fiscal and to a lesser extent by capitalized personnel costs for employees directly related to the application development stage of development projects decreasing by million during fiscal when compared to fiscal we expect technical operations and development expenses to increase slightly  in absolute dollars  going forward as our business continues to grow and as we further develop our applications and services

based on the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material interest rate risk exposure at december  although we have a functional currency of us dollars  a major portion of our fixed expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
our policy with respect to foreign currency exposure is to manage financial exposure to certain foreign exchange fluctuations with the objective of neutralizing some of the impact of foreign currency exchange movements 
accordingly  we have entered into foreign exchange forward plus contracts to mitigate the exchange rate risk on portions of our canadian dollar 
table of contents exposure 
these contracts  entered into in september and october  will be utilized over the period ending december  on september   we entered into a series of forward contracts with a notional value of million  whereby  is converted into canadian dollars on a semi monthly basis through september these forward contracts are designed to hedge our expected canadian dollar requirements over the period 
on each expiry date  provided that the limit rate us cdn has not been reached during the one month window before the expiration date of each contract  we will sell us  and buy canadian dollars at the then current exchange rate or at the base rate of us cdn whichever is more beneficial to us 
should the limit rate be reached during the one month window before the expiration date of each contract  then that contracts will be fixed at the base rate of us cdn for delivery on its value dates 
on october   in order to manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  we entered into a series of forward foreign exchange contracts  whereby amounts of  are converted into canadian dollars on a semi monthly basis from january to december at foreign exchange rates varying from to 
as we do not comply with the documentation requirements for hedge accounting  we account for the fair value of the derivative instruments within the consolidated balance sheet as a derivative financial asset or liability and the corresponding change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
we have no other freestanding or embedded derivative instruments 
the impact of the fair value adjustment on unrealized foreign exchange forward contracts for fiscal was a net loss of approximately million  and for fiscal  the impact was a net gain of approximately  which is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts amounting to million 
as of december   we had no outstanding foreign currency forward contracts 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis model for foreign exchange exposure over fiscal the analysis used a modeling technique that compares the us dollar equivalent of all expenses incurred in canadian dollars  at the actual exchange rate  to a hypothetical adverse movement in the foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  with all other variables held constant 
foreign currency exchange rates used were based on the market rates in effect during fiscal the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a decrease in net income for fiscal of approximately million 
there can be no assurances that the above projected exchange rate decrease will materialize 
fluctuations of exchange rates are beyond the actions to hedge or mitigate these risks 
credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents  marketable securities  foreign exchange contracts and accounts receivable 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions whom we have evaluated as highly creditworthy and commercial paper 
with respect to accounts receivable  we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers  generally granting uncollateralized credit terms to our customers  and maintaining an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and our expectation of future losses
