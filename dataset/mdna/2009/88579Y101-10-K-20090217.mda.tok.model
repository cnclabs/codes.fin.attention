item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
results are impacted by the effects of  and changes in  worldwide economic and capital markets conditions 
the company operates in more than countries and derives approximately percent of its revenues from outside the united states 
the company s business may be adversely affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control  such as disruptions in financial markets or downturns in economic activity in specific countries or regions  or in the various industries in which the company operates  social  political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions  or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital  interest rates  tax rates  or regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the company s credit ratings are important to m s cost of capital 
the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company s credit profile and have assigned debt ratings to m that are near the top of the ratings spectrum 
this evaluation is based on a number of factors  which include financial strength  business and financial risk  as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting 
the company has an aa credit rating  with a stable outlook  from standard poor s and an aa credit rating  with a negative outlook  from moody s investors service 
the company s strong ratings serve to lower m s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders 
failure to maintain the current ratings level could adversely affect the company s cost of funds  liquidity and access to capital markets 
the company s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences 
demand for the company s products  which impacts revenue and profit margins  is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products  ii the company s response to downward pricing to stay competitive  iii changes in customer order patterns  such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes  changes in the company s incentive programs  or the customer s ability to achieve incentive goals  and iv changes in customers preferences for our products  including the success of products offered by our competitors  and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company s products 
foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings 
because the company s financial statements are denominated in us dollars and approximately percent of the company s revenues are derived from outside the united states  the company s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 
the company s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings  including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market 
this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development  such as the inability to identify viable new products  obtain adequate intellectual property protection  or gain market acceptance of new products 
there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful 
the company s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components  compounds  raw materials and energy  including oil and natural gas and their derivatives  due to shortages  increased demand  supply interruptions  currency exchange risks  natural disasters and other factors 
the company depends on various components  compounds  raw materials  and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products 
it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events  or be terminated in the future 
any sustained interruption in the company s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
acquisitions  strategic alliances  divestitures  and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies  and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results 
the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions  strategic alliances  divestitures and changes to its organizational structure 
with respect to acquisitions  future results will be affected by the company s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies 
the company s future results may be affected if the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated 
the company utilizes various tools  such as lean six sigma  to improve operational efficiency and productivity 
there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized 
the company s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings  including those involving product liability  antitrust  environmental or other matters 
the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company s expectations because the outcomes of litigation  including regulatory matters  are often difficult to reliably predict 
various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable  or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable 
table of contents estimates  such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment  a significant settlement  significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law 
a future adverse ruling  settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period

  and r  which was issued in september and effective as of december  sfas no 
requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes 
table of contents in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income  which is a component of stockholders equity 
pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant s years of service  compensation  and age at retirement or termination 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and liability measurement 
the assumed health care trend rate is the most significant postretirement health care assumption 
see note for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 
the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december measurement date for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality  fixed income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits 
using this methodology  the company determined a discount rate of to be appropriate as of december   which is an increase from the rate used as of december  a significant element in determining the company s pension expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets  which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes 
for the us pension plan  refer to note for information on how the expected long term rate of return on an annualized basis for is determined 
for the year ended december   the company recognized total consolidated pre tax pension expense after settlements  curtailments and special termination benefits of million  down from million in pension expense before settlements  curtailments and special termination benefits is anticipated to increase to approximately million in for the pension plans  holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of of a percentage point would decrease increase pension expense by approximately million for us pension plans and approximately million for international pension plans 
also  holding all other factors constant  an increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities of of a percentage point would decrease pension expense by approximately million for us pension plans and approximately million for international pension plans 
a decrease in the discount rate of of a percentage point would increase pension expense by approximately million for us pension and plans and approximately million for international pension plans 
see note for details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care trend rates on the postretirement health care benefit expense and obligation 
asset impairments m net property  plant and equipment totaled billion as of december  management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time 
this includes the recoverability of long lived assets employed in the business  including assets of acquired businesses 
these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant 
for instance  expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group 
impairments recorded in  and related to restructuring actions and other exit activities are discussed in note m goodwill totaled approximately billion as of december   which  based on impairment testing  is not impaired 
impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level  with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit 
reporting units are one level below the business segment level m has six business segments at december   but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics 
as of december   m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing 
an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price earnings ratio for comparable industry groups  or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 
m typically uses the price earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows 
m uses the discounted cash flow approach for start up  loss position and declining businesses  but also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions 
m completes its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year 
as of december   m had primary reporting units  with eight reporting units accounting for nearly percent of the goodwill 
at m  reporting units generally correspond to a division 
these eight reporting units were comprised of the following divisions occupational health and environmental safety  cuno  optical systems  espe  communication markets  security systems  industrial adhesives and tapes  and health information systems 
these 
table of contents eight reporting units all generated operating income for total year as part of its annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter  m used discounted cash flow models for its cuno  optical systems and security systems divisions 
a weighted average discounted cash flow analysis was performed for the cuno and optical systems divisions  using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions  among other factors 
the weighting was based on managements estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring 
the discounted cash flows for the cuno  optical systems and security systems divisions were all in excess of their respective net book values  with no impairment indicated 
in  in addition to using discounted cash flows for certain reporting units  m used an adjusted industry price earnings ratio approach for the remaining reporting units 
m adjusted the stated applicable industry price earnings ratio downward for its annual test in the fourth quarter  unlike prior years when no adjustment was required 
without this adjustment  the addition of each reporting unit s estimated market values would have been significantly in excess of m s total company market value  which would have resulted in an unusually high implied control premium 
the control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to m s total company market value  with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the value for the total company 
for example  at year end  m s market value was approximately billion  but if each reporting unit was sold individually  m s value would be approximately billion using a percent control premium 
m factored down its price earnings ratio significantly for the respective reporting units to approximate what the price earnings ratio would be at a more normal historical control premium of approximately percent for the total company 
even after including this adjustment to the price earnings ratio  no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units 
in addition  m s market value at december  of approximately billion is significantly in excess of its book value of approximately billion 
m will continue to monitor its reporting units in for any triggering events or other signs of impairment 
income taxes the extent of m s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors  including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal  state  and international tax audits 
the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
as of january   the company follows fin guidance to record these liabilities refer to note for additional information 
the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company s current estimate of the tax liabilities 
if the company s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary 
new accounting pronouncements information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition and liquidity the strength of m s capital structure and consistency of its cash flows provide m stable access to capital markets in these uncertain times

various assets and liabilities  including cash and short term debt  can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short term liquidity needs 
working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities totaled billion at december   compared with billion at december  working capital decreases were attributable to declines in cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and accounts receivable  while increases in short term debt and other current liabilities also decreased working capital 
this was partially offset by working capital increases attributable to decreases in accounts payable and accrued income taxes  combined with increases in inventory

the category other net in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts  including outstanding liabilities at december  related to m s restructuring actions note 
in  cash flows provided by operating activities increased million  including an increase in net income of million 
since the gain from sale of businesses is included in and increases net income  the pre tax gain from the sale of the businesses must be subtracted  as shown above  to properly reflect operating cash flows 
the cash proceeds from the sale of the pharmaceuticals business are shown as part of cash from investing activities  however  when the related taxes are paid they are required to be shown as part of cash provided by operating activities 
thus  operating cash flows for were penalized due to cash income tax payments of approximately million in that related to the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business

unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company 
included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts  capital commitments  service agreements and utilities 
these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year 
many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts  in which m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers 
the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations 
contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table  but these commitments represent a small part of the company s expected capital spending in and beyond 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated 
the majority of m s products and services are purchased as needed  with no unconditional commitment 
for this reason  these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the company s expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis 
other obligations  included in the preceding table within the caption entitled unconditional purchase obligations and other  include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under fin the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore  the long term portion of the net tax liability of million is excluded from the preceding table

a monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the company s exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss or benefit in after tax earnings of financial instruments  derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december  the model third party bank dataset used a percent confidence level over a month time horizon 
the model used analyzed currencies  interest rates related to three currencies  and five commodities  but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company 
this model does not include certain hedge transactions  because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results 
foreign exchange rate risk of loss or benefit increased substantially in primarily due to increases in volatility during  which is one of the key drivers in the valuation model 
the decline in interest rate risk of loss or benefit during was primarily due to decreases in interest rates 
the following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after tax earnings related to these exposures 
adverse impact on positive impact on after tax earnings after tax earnings millions foreign exchange rates interest rates commodity rates the global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a percent price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately million per year 
the global energy exposure is such that a percent price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately million per year 
derivative instruments are used to hedge approximately percent of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately percent of this energy exposure
