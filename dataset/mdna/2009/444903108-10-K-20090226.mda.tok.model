item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview human genome sciences  inc hgs is a commercially focused biopharmaceutical company advancing toward the market with three products in late stage clinical development albuferon for chronic hepatitis c  lymphostat b for systemic lupus erythematosus sle  and abthrax tm for inhalation anthrax 
in january  we achieved our first product sales when we began delivery of abthrax to the us strategic national stockpile 
albuferon and lymphostat b are also progressing toward commercialization 
in december  we reported that albuferon successfully met its primary endpoint in the first of two phase clinical trials in chronic hepatitis c  we expect to report results of the second phase trial in march if results in the second phase trial are also successful  we expect the filing of global marketing applications for albuferon in fall we completed enrollment in both phase trials of lymphostat b in sle in  and we expect to report the results of these studies in july and november  respectively 
assuming success in phase  we plan to file global marketing applications for lymphostat b in the first half of we also have substantial financial rights to two novel drugs that glaxosmithkline gsk has advanced to late stage development 
in december  gsk initiated the first phase clinical trial of darapladib  which was discovered by gsk based on hgs technology  in more than  men and women with chronic coronary heart disease 
gsk plans to initiate a second large phase trial of darapladib in late in february  gsk initiated a phase clinical trial program for syncria albiglutide in the long term treatment of type diabetes mellitus 
syncria was created by hgs using our proprietary albumin fusion technology  and we licensed syncria to gsk in hgs also has several novel drugs in earlier stages of clinical development for the treatment of cancer  led by our trail receptor antibody hgs etr and a small molecule antagonist of iap inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 
our strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies allow us to leverage our strengths and gain access to sales and marketing infrastructure  as well as complementary technologies 
some of these partnerships provide us with licensing or other fees  clinical development cost sharing  milestone payments and rights to royalty payments as products are developed and commercialized 
in some cases  we are entitled to certain commercialization  co promotion  revenue sharing and other product rights 
we have not received any significant product sales revenue or royalties from product sales through and any significant revenue from product sales or from royalties on product sales in the next several years is uncertain  other than with respect to abthrax 
to date  substantially all of our revenue relates to payments received under our collaboration and license agreements 
during  we entered into a collaboration agreement with novartis international pharmaceutical  ltd 
novartis 
under this agreement  novartis will co develop and co commercialize albuferon and share development costs  sales and marketing expenses and profits of any product that is commercialized in the us novartis will be responsible for commercialization outside the us and will pay hgs a royalty on these sales 
we received a million up front fee from novartis upon the execution of the agreement and are recognizing this payment as revenue ratably over the estimated development period ending in including this up front fee  we are entitled to payments aggregating million upon the successful attainment of certain milestones 
as of december   we have contractually earned and received payments aggregating million 
we are recognizing these milestones as revenue ratably over the estimated remaining development period 
in  gsk exercised its option to co develop and co commercialize two of our products  lymphostat b and hgs etr in accordance with a co development and co commercialization agreement signed during related to lymphostat b  we and gsk will share phase and development costs  and will share equally in sales and marketing expenses and profits of any product that is commercialized 
we received a million payment during as partial consideration for entering into this agreement with respect to lymphostat b and are recognizing this payment as revenue ratably over the estimated development period ending in during  we reacquired gsk s rights to trail receptor antibodies including rights to hgs etr and hgs etr from overview continued gsk  in exchange for a reduction in potential future royalties due to us for a product currently being developed by gsk 
in  we entered into a two phase contract to supply abthrax  a human monoclonal antibody developed for use in the treatment of anthrax disease  with the us government 
under the first phase of the contract  we supplied ten grams of abthrax to the us department of health and human services hhs for comparative in vitro and in vivo testing 
during  under the second phase of the contract  the us government exercised its option to purchase  treatment courses of abthrax for the strategic national stockpile 
in january we began delivery of abthrax to the us strategic national stockpile and in february the product was accepted and we recorded revenue for the product as well as certain costs incurred to develop abthrax 
we expect that any significant revenue or income for at least the next two years may be limited to abthrax revenue  payments under collaboration agreements to the extent milestones are met  cost reimbursements from gsk and novartis  payments from the sale of product rights  payments under manufacturing agreements  such as our agreement with hospira  inc  investment income and other payments from other collaborators and licensees under existing or future arrangements  to the extent that we enter into any future arrangements 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts 
as a result  we expect to incur continued and significant losses over the next several years unless we are able to realize additional revenues under existing or any future agreements 
the timing and amounts of such revenues  if any  cannot be predicted with certainty and will likely fluctuate sharply 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to the results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
such judgments are often the result of a need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
see note b  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we currently believe the following accounting policies to be critical investments 
we account for investments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
we carry our investments at their respective fair values  except for our investment in aegera pharmaceuticals  inc aegera  which is carried at historical cost because it is a privately held company for which no quoted market price is available 
we periodically evaluate the fair values of our investments to determine whether any declines in the fair value of investments represent an other than temporary impairment 
this evaluation consists of a review of several factors  including but not limited to the length of time and extent that a security has been in an unrealized loss position  the existence of an event that would impair the issuer s future repayment potential  the near term prospects for recovery of the market value of a security and our intent and ability to hold the security until the market values recover  which may be maturity 
if management determines that such an impairment exists we would recognize an impairment charge 
because we may determine that market or business conditions may lead us to sell a short term investment or marketable security prior to maturity  we classify our short term investments and marketable securities as available for sale 
investments in securities that are classified as available for sale and have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair market value in the balance sheets  and unrealized holding gains and losses for these investments are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized  or an other than temporary impairment is recorded 
we classify those marketable securities that may be used in operations within one year as short term investments 
those marketable securities in which we have both the ability to hold until maturity and critical accounting policies and the use of estimates continued have a maturity date beyond one year from our most recent consolidated balance sheet date are classified as non current marketable securities 
we review the carrying value of the aegera investment on a periodic basis for indicators of impairment  and adjust the value accordingly 
for investments carried at fair value  we disclose the level within the fair value hierarchy as prescribed by sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

we evaluate the types of securities in our investment portfolios to determine the proper classification in the fair value hierarchy based on trading activity and the observability of market inputs 
we generally obtain a single quote or price per instrument from independent third parties to help us determine the fair value of securities in level and level of the fair value hierarchy 
leases 
we lease various real properties under operating leases that generally require us to pay taxes  insurance and maintenance 
during  we terminated one lease agreement the traville lease with wachovia development corporation wdc  which had been structured as a synthetic lease and had been accounted for as an operating lease 
in place of the traville synthetic lease  we entered into a year lease agreement with biomed realty trust  inc biomed  which acquired the traville facility from wdc 
we account for the traville lease with biomed as an operating lease 
during and as described further in note i  long term debt  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we sold our lsm facility and headquarters land to biomed  and simultaneously agreed to lease such assets back over a period of years 
we accounted for this transaction in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases sale leaseback transactions involving real estate 
because we have continuing involvement with the properties and an option to repurchase such assets  we recorded the sale and leaseback of these assets as a financing transaction and accordingly recorded the allocated sale proceeds as outstanding debt on our balance sheet 
we account for lease payments under the related lease agreements as principal and interest payments on this debt 
we retained ownership of approximately million in equipment located at the lsm  which is required to be kept in place during the lease term or upon any expiration  termination or default 
impairments of long lived assets 
long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
long lived assets to be sold are carried at fair value less costs to sell 
during  we recorded exit and impairment charges of approximately million and million relating to certain space in our traville headquarters and certain laboratory space  respectively 
during  we sold the laboratory space and reversed the remaining exit and impairment charges related to that space 
revenue 
our revenue recognition policies for all non refundable up front license fees and milestone arrangements are in accordance with the guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition sab no 

in addition  we follow the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  for multiple element revenue arrangements entered into or materially amended after june  eitf provides guidance on when an arrangement that involves multiple revenue generating activities or deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if this division is required  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
if the deliverables in a revenue arrangement constitute separate units of accounting according to the eitf s separation criteria  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for each identified unit 
if the arrangement is a single unit of accounting  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for the entire arrangement 
under arrangements where the license fees and research and development activities cannot be accounted for as separate units of accounting  non refundable up front license fees are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the expected critical accounting policies and the use of estimates continued term of our continued involvement in the research and development process 
revenues from the achievement of research and development milestones  if deemed substantive  are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved  and the milestone payments are due and collectible 
if not deemed substantive  we would recognize such milestone as revenue on a straight line basis over the remaining expected term of continued involvement in the research and development process 
milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met the milestone is non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved to achieve the milestone  and  the amount of the milestone appears reasonable in relation to the effort expended  the other milestones in the arrangement and the related risk associated with the achievement of the milestone and any ongoing research and development or other services are priced at fair value 
payments received in advance of work performed are recorded as deferred revenue 
the up front license fee received in from novartis in connection with our albuferon product is being recognized ratably over an estimated four year clinical development period ending in to the extent we achieve the clinical development milestones set forth in the novartis agreement  these will be recognized ratably over the remaining estimated clinical development period from the date of attainment 
our initial payment from gsk in connection with lymphostat b is being recognized ratably over the estimated four year clinical development period ending in our up front license fee with gsk in connection with syncria is being recognized ratably over the estimated seven year clinical development period 
our revenues from teva biopharmaceuticals usa  inc teva bio  formerly cogenesys  as they relate to the intellectual property license  are being recognized on a straight line basis over the three year period covered by the manufacturing services agreement  as amended 
our other revenues in  and have been recognized in full upon receipt  as we have no continuing obligation 
during  we entered into an agreement whereby we began providing contract manufacturing services 
revenue in  which was not significant  was recorded as milestones were met 
research and development 
research and development expenses primarily include related salaries  outside services  materials and supplies and allocated facility costs 
such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
our drug development expenses include accruals for clinical site and clinical research organization cro costs 
estimates of the incurred to date but not yet received invoices must be made for clinical site and cro costs in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
reimbursement of research and development expenses received in connection with collaborative cost sharing agreements is recorded as a reduction of such expenses 
stock compensation 
we have a stock incentive plan the incentive plan under which options to purchase shares of our common stock may be granted to employees  consultants and directors at a price no less than the quoted market value on the date of grant 
the incentive plan also provides for awards in the form of stock appreciation rights  restricted non vested or unrestricted stock awards  stock equivalent units or performance based stock awards 
we account for share based awards to employees and non employee directors pursuant to sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
the amount of compensation expense recognized using the fair value method requires us to exercise judgment and make assumptions relating to the factors that determine the fair value of our stock option grants 
we use the black scholes merton model to estimate the fair value of our option grants 
the fair value calculated by this model is a function of several factors  including grant price  the risk free interest rate  the estimated term of the option and the estimated future volatility of the option 
the estimated term and estimated future volatility of the options require our judgment 
exit accruals 
in  we exited certain facilities  which required us to make significant estimates in several areas including the realizable values of assets deemed redundant or excess and the ability to generate sublease income 
we recorded an initial liability of approximately million in lease related costs with respect to our exit activities 
during  we sold one of the facilities that we exited in and reversed the remaining exit and impairment accrual of million related to that space 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
we had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues for the year ended december  consisted primarily of revenue recognized from novartis of million for the straight line recognition of up front license fees and milestones reached for albuferon and million from gsk related to straight line recognition of up front license fees for lymphostat b 
the revenues consisted primarily of million in revenue recognized from novartis for the straight line recognition of up front license fees and milestones reached for albuferon and million from gsk related to straight line recognition of up front license fees for lymphostat b 
expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  research and development expenses for include million paid to aegera in connection with a collaboration and license agreement 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  are net of million and million of costs reimbursed by novartis and gsk  respectively 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  are net of million and million of costs reimbursed by novartis and gsk respectively 
we track our research and development expenditures by type of cost incurred research  pharmaceutical sciences  manufacturing and clinical development costs 
our research costs amounted to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is due to the million paid to aegera in in connection with our licensing and collaboration agreement and purchase price premium as compared to a million milestone paid to aegera in  partially offset by an increase in activities supporting new target development 
our research costs for the years ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our pharmaceutical sciences costs  where we focus on improving formulation  process development and production methods  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to less cost reimbursement under the albuferon program and greater activity in other projects for which we have no cost sharing provisions 
pharmaceutical sciences costs for the years ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our manufacturing costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to increased production activities for abthrax and lymphostat b  partially offset by decreased activities for hgs etr and albuferon 
our manufacturing costs for the years ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our clinical development costs decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to reduced phase albuferon clinical trial costs as the trials near completion  partially offset by increased phase trial costs related to lymphostat b 
our clinical development costs for the years ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
the research and development expenditures noted above are categorized by functional area 
we evaluate and prioritize our activities according to functional area  rather than on a per project basis 
for this reason  we do not maintain a formal accounting system that captures or allocates all costs  both direct and indirect  on a per project basis 
therefore  we do not believe that our available project by project information would form a reasonable basis for disclosure to investors 
results of operations continued years ended december  and continued general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to increased preparatory activities for commercialization 
general and administrative expenses include approximately million related to the settlement of certain patent proceedings  which were offset by a decrease in other legal expenses 
during  we did not incur any lease termination or restructuring charges 
lease termination and restructuring credits in related to the reversal of a liability and the recording of a gain aggregating million in connection with the purchase and sale of a small laboratory and office building 
see note n  facility related exit costs  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
investment income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to lower average investment balances in as compared to investment income also includes realized net gains on our short term investments  marketable securities and restricted investments of million for the year ended december  as compared to net gains of million for the year ended december  the yield on our investments was approximately for the year ended december   as compared to approximately for the year ended december  we believe investment income will be lower in as a result of lower interest rates and lower average cash balances 
a general decline in interest rates may adversely affect the interest earned from our portfolio as securities mature and may be replaced with securities having a lower interest rate 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  we expect interest expense to increase in as a result of the adoption of financial accounting standards board staff position no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb 
see note b  significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
the charge for impaired investments of million during the year ended december  was due to an other than temporary impairment of our investment in debt securities issued by lehman brothers holdings  inc lbhi 
during  lbhi experienced a significant deterioration in its credit worthiness and filed a petition under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
as a result  we determined that our investment in lbhi debt securities had incurred an other than temporary impairment 
see note c  investments  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
our gain on sale of long term equity investments during the year ended december  of million relates to the sale of our investment in cogenesys 
in  we completed the sale of assets of our cogenesys division and held a equity interest in the newly formed company cogenesys 
in  cogenesys was acquired by teva pharmaceuticals industries  ltd 
teva 
we received initial proceeds of million 
our cost basis in this investment was million 
we received additional proceeds of approximately million in february related to this transaction 
see note d  collaboration agreements and us government agreement  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
net income loss 
we recorded a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the decreased loss for compared to is primarily due to the gain on sale of our cogenesys investment of million  or per share  and increase revenues  partially offset by a decrease in investment income and a charge for impaired investments of million  or per share 
years ended december  and revenues 
we had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues for the year ended december  consisted primarily of revenue recognized from novartis of million for the straight line recognition of up front license fees and milestones reached for albuferon and million from gsk related to straight line recognition of up front license fees for lymphostat b 
results of operations continued years ended december  and continued the revenues consisted primarily of million in revenue recognized from gsk  consisting of million related to syncria  including a million milestone received and recognized  million related to straight line recognition of up front license fees for lymphostat b  and million related to milestones met for two other products under gsk development  revenue recognized from novartis of million for the straight line recognized of up front license fees and a milestone reached in for albuferon  revenue recognized from transgene of million and revenue recognized from cogenesys of million 
expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  research and development expenses for include million paid to aegera in connection with our licensing and collaboration agreement and purchase price premium 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  are net of million and million of costs reimbursed or to be reimbursed by novartis and gsk respectively 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  are net of million and million of costs reimbursed by novartis and gsk respectively  and million of cost reimbursement from cogenesys 
our research costs amounted to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is due to the million paid to aegera in connection with our licensing and collaboration agreement and purchase price premium 
our research costs for the years ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under costs sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our pharmaceutical sciences costs decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to cost reimbursement under our collaboration agreements and reduced activity in this area for our abthrax program 
pharmaceutical sciences costs for the years ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our manufacturing costs decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to cost reimbursement under our collaboration agreements and reduced non project activities  partially offset by increased production activities for hgs etr and hgs etr our manufacturing costs for the years ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our clinical development costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to cost associated with the complete enrollment of phase trials for albuferon and ongoing enrollment of phase trials for lymphostat b 
these phase trials were just starting at the end of  therefore minimal expenses were incurred in compared to our clinical development costs for the year ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements  which began in mid general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to increased legal expenses associated with patent proceedings for certain of our products  partially offset by lower stock based compensation expense 
lease termination and restructuring credits in related to the reversal of a liability and the recording of a gain aggregating million in connection with the purchase and sale of a small laboratory and office building 
the lease termination and restructuring charges of million for the year ended december  consist of a lease termination charge of million related to the biomed financing and exit and impairment charges of approximately million related to space no longer in use at our headquarters location and a small laboratory results of operations continued years ended december  and continued building 
see note n  facility related exit costs of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
investment income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to higher interest rates in our portfolio in  partially offset by lower average balances of cash  short term investments and marketable securities 
investment income also includes realized net gains on our short term investments  marketable securities and restricted investments of million for the year ended december  as compared to net losses of million for the year ended december  the yield on our investments was approximately for the year ended december   as compared to approximately for the year ended december  interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to interest expense on the debt associated with the sale and leaseback of the lsm facility to biomed 
interest expense for the year ended december  is net of interest capitalized of million in connection with the construction of our lsm facility 
no interest expense was capitalized in the third quarter of or subsequently as we placed the lsm facility in service and ceased capitalization of interest at the end of the second quarter 
interest expense  before capitalized interest  was million for the year ended december  during  we had no gains on sale of equity investments 
during we recognized a gain sale of investment of million related to the sale of our remaining equity interest in cambridge antibody technology ltd 
cat  a long term investment  for net proceeds of million compared to a cost basis of million 
net income loss 
we recorded a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the increased loss for compared to is primarily due to increased clinical development costs related to our phase programs  increased research costs related to our license agreement with aegera and increased interest expense  partially offset by increased revenue and a decrease in lease termination and restructuring charges 
liquidity and capital resources we had a working capital shortfall of million at december  as compared to working capital of million at december  the decrease in our working capital in is primarily due to the use of working capital to fund our operations  partially offset by receipt of million related to the sale of our investment in cogenesys see note p  teva biopharmaceuticals usa  inc formerly cogenesys  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
although current liabilities exceed current assets as of december   current liabilities include million of deferred revenue which will be relieved through non cash amortization 
the delivery of abthrax to the us strategic national stockpile will generate over million during which will improve our working capital position  net of million used in february to extinguish approximately million of our subordinated convertible notes 
we may also receive payments under collaboration agreements  to the extent milestones are met  which would improve our working capital position 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  which may increase relative to historical levels as we focus on clinical trials and manufacturing required for the development of our active product candidates 
we will also incur costs related to our pre commercial launch activities 
in the event our working capital needs for exceed our available working capital  we can utilize our non current marketable securities  which are classified as available for sale 
we may improve our working capital position during through the sale of additional abthrax product  receipt of collaboration fees or financing activities 
we will be evaluating our working capital position on a continuing basis 
to minimize our exposure to credit risk  we invest in securities with strong credit ratings and have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturity with the objectives of maintaining safety of principal and liquidity and capital resources continued liquidity 
we do not invest in derivative financial instruments or auction rate securities  and we generally hold our investments in debt securities until maturity 
however  the deterioration of the credit markets during had a detrimental effect on our investment portfolio 
during  we recorded a charge for impairment of debt securities issued by lbhi of million 
at december   we have gross unrealized losses on our available for sale investments of approximately million 
our unrealized losses substantially relate to corporate debt securities 
our other non current marketable securities  consisting primarily of government sponsored enterprise securities  have not experienced any significant unrealized losses at december  the amortized cost and fair value of these other non current marketable securities are approximately million and million  respectively  at december  if needed  we could liquidate some or all of these securities in order to meet our working capital needs 
the amounts of expenditures that will be needed to carry out our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
we are conducting multiple phase trials and have several ongoing phase and phase trials and expect to initiate additional trials in the future 
completion of these trials may extend several years or more  but the length of time generally varies considerably according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the drug candidate 
we estimated that the completion periods for our phase  phase  and phase trials could span one year  one to two years and two to four years  respectively 
some trials may take considerably longer to complete 
the duration and cost of our clinical trials are a function of numerous factors such as the number of patients to be enrolled in the trial  the amount of time it takes to enroll them  the length of time they must be treated and observed  and the number of clinical sites and countries for the trial 
our clinical development expenses are impacted by the clinical phase of our drug candidates 
our expenses increase as our drug candidates move to later phases of clinical development 
the status of our clinical projects is as follows clinical trial status as of december  product candidate indication albuferon hepatitis c phase phase phase lymphostat b systemic lupus erythematosus phase phase phase lymphostat b rheumatoid arthritis phase phase phase hgs etr cancer phase phase phase hgs etr cancer phase phase phase abthrax anthrax hgs cancer phase includes only those candidates for which an investigational new drug ind application has been filed with the fda 
clinical trial status defined as when patients are being dosed 
patient dosing completed during in  some patients in follow up as of december  initial phase trial completed and phase enrollment initiated in  patient dosing began in initial phase trial completed  extension safety study ongoing and further development under review 
we have begun delivery of abthrax to the us strategic national stockpile 
we anticipate filing a biologics license application bla in ind filed in december with respect to hgs formerly aeg 
we identify our drug candidates by conducting numerous preclinical studies 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each drug candidate 
based upon the results from our trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain indications or certain drugs in order to concentrate our resources on more promising drug candidates 
liquidity and capital resources continued we are advancing a number of drug candidates  including antibodies  an albumin fusion protein and a small molecule  in part to diversify the risks associated with our research and development spending 
in addition  our manufacturing plants have been designed to enable multi product manufacturing capability 
accordingly  we believe our future financial commitments  including those for preclinical  clinical or manufacturing activities  are not substantially dependent on any single drug candidate 
should we be unable to sustain a multi product drug pipeline  our dependence on the success of a single drug candidate would increase 
we must receive regulatory clearance to advance each of our products into and through each phase of clinical testing 
moreover  we must receive regulatory approval to launch any of our products commercially 
in order to receive such approval  the appropriate regulatory agency must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy and that our products and the manufacturing facilities meet all applicable regulatory requirements 
we cannot be certain that we will establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to receive regulatory approval for any of our drugs or that our drugs and the manufacturing facilities will meet all applicable regulatory requirements 
part of our business plan includes collaborating with others 
for example  we entered into a collaboration agreement in with novartis to co develop and co commercialize albuferon 
under this agreement  we will co commercialize albuferon in the united states  and will share us commercialization costs and us profits equally 
novartis will be responsible for commercialization outside the us and will pay us a royalty on those sales 
we and novartis share clinical development costs 
including a non refundable up front license fee  we are entitled to payments aggregating approximately million upon successful attainment of certain milestones 
as of december   we have contractually earned and received milestones aggregating million  including the up front fee 
in  we entered into a collaboration agreement with gsk with respect to lymphostat b and received a payment of million 
we and gsk share phase and development costs  and will share equally in sales and marketing expenses and profits of any product that is commercialized 
during  we recorded approximately million of reimbursable expenses from novartis and gsk with respect to our cost sharing agreements as a reduction of research and development expenses 
we are recognizing the up front fees and milestones received from novartis and gsk as revenue ratably over the estimated remaining development periods 
we have other collaborators who have sole responsibility for product development 
for example  gsk is developing other products under separate agreements as part of our overall relationship with them 
we have no control over the progress of gsk s development plans 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of our current or future collaborations will affect our drug development 
because of the uncertainties discussed above  the costs to advance our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and may vary significantly 
we expect that our existing funds  payments received under the abthrax contract and other agreements and investment income will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  primarily including the scope and costs of our clinical development programs  the scope and costs of our manufacturing and process development activities  the magnitude of our discovery and preclinical development programs and the level of our pre commercial launch activities 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing required in the future will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
depending upon market and interest rate conditions  we are exploring  and  from time to time  may take actions to strengthen further our financial position 
we may undertake financings and may repurchase or restructure some or all of our outstanding convertible debt instruments in the future depending upon market and other conditions 
in february we repurchased approximately million of our convertible subordinated debt due in and at a cost of approximately million plus accrued interest 
we have certain contractual obligations which may have a future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
our operating leases  along with our unconditional purchase obligations  are not recorded on our balance sheets 
debt associated with the sale and accompanying leaseback of our lsm facility to biomed in is recorded on our balance sheet as of december  and under the lsm lease  we have an option to liquidity and capital resources continued purchase the property between and at prices ranging between approximately million and million  depending upon when we exercise this option 
we have an option to purchase the traville facility in for million 
our contractual obligations as of december  are summarized as follows payments due by period one year two to four to after total or less three years five years five years dollars in millions contractual obligations long term debt convertible notes long term lease commitment biomed operating leases unconditional purchase obligations abthrax milestones and royalties other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheets total contractual cash obligations contractual interest obligations related to our convertible subordinated notes included above total million as of december  contractual interest obligations of million  million and million are due in one year or less  two to three years and four to five years  respectively 
in february  we repurchased a portion of our convertible subordinated notes 
this repurchase reduces the principal due in two to three years and four to five years by million and million  respectively 
contractual interest obligations due in one year or less  two to three years and four to five years are reduced by million  million and million  respectively  as a result of the repurchase 
contractual interest obligations related to biomed are included above and aggregate million as of december  contractual interest obligations of million  million  million and million are due in one year or less  two to three years  four to five years and after five years  respectively 
includes traville headquarters operating lease with biomed with aggregate payments of million 
lease payments of million  million  million and million are due in one year or less  two to three years  four to five years and after five years  respectively 
the operating lease obligations shown above are the gross amounts  not considering sublease income 
contractual sublease income of million and million is due in one year or less and two to three years  respectively 
certain of our operating leases contain financial covenants with respect to minimum levels of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and minimum levels of net worth 
during  we amended certain of these leases to eliminate the minimum net worth covenant and adjust the minimum levels of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities required under the leases 
we also pledged additional collateral of approximately million to certain lessors to satisfy the minimum net worth covenant associated with certain other leases 
during  approximately million of this additional collateral was released  as the lease terms of the related leases expired 
our unconditional purchase obligations relate to commitments for capital expenditures 
includes milestone payments and royalties associated with the delivery of abthrax to the us strategic national stockpile 
in the event we reach certain development milestones for albuferon and lymphostat b such as successful completion of phase trials or regulatory approval  we would be obligated to make payments of up to million over the next five years 
in the event we reach certain development milestones related to liquidity and capital resources continued hgs  we would be obligated to pay up to million 
our other products are in either phase or phase and would also obligate us to make certain milestone payments should they reach phase or regulatory approval 
these other payments could result in aggregate milestone payments of million 
because we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of these products will reach these milestones  we have excluded these amounts and any royalty payments from the above table 
for additional discussion of our debt obligations and lease commitments  see note i  long term debt and note j  commitments and other matters  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately billion  which expire  if unused  through december  we also have available research and development tax credit and other tax credit carry forwards of approximately million  the majority of which will expire  if unused  through december  our unrestricted and restricted funds may be invested in us treasury securities  government agency obligations  high grade corporate debt securities and various money market instruments rated a or better 
such investments reflect our policy regarding the investment of liquid assets  which is to seek a reasonable rate of return consistent with an emphasis on safety  liquidity and preservation of capital 
off balance sheet arrangements during and  we entered into two long term leases with the maryland economic development corporation medco expiring january  for a process development and small scale manufacturing facility aggregating  square feet and built to our specifications 
we have accounted for these leases as operating leases 
the facility was financed primarily through a combination of bonds issued by medco medco bonds and loans issued to medco by certain state of maryland agencies 
we have no equity interest in medco 
rent is based upon medco s debt service obligations and annual base rent under the leases currently is approximately million 
the medco bonds are secured by letters of credit issued for the account of medco which expire in december medco s debt service obligations may be affected by prevailing interest rate conditions in  which could in turn affect our rent and the level of our restricted investments 
we have restricted investments of approximately million and million as of december  and december   respectively  and are required to maintain restricted investments of million which serve as additional security for the medco letters of credit reimbursement obligation 
upon default or early lease termination or in the event the letters of credit will not be renewed  the medco bond indenture trustee can draw upon the letters of credit to pay the medco bonds as they are tendered 
in such an event  we could lose part or all of our restricted investments and could record a charge to earnings for a corresponding amount 
alternatively  we have an option during or at the end of the lease term to purchase this facility for an aggregate amount that declines from approximately million in to approximately million in the lease agreements contain covenants with respect to tangible net worth  cash and cash equivalents and investment securities  restrictions on dividends  as well as other covenants

the forward looking statements are based on our current intent  belief and expectations 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict

in addition  while we have begun shipment of abthrax to the us strategic national stockpile  we continue to face risks related to acceptance of future shipments and fda s approval of our biologics license application for abthrax  if and when it is submitted 
if we are unable to meet requirements associated with the abthrax contract  future revenues from the sale of abthrax to the us government will not occur

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have operations of a material nature that are subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations 
we do  however  have certain aspects of our global clinical studies that are subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio may be comprised of low risk us treasuries  government sponsored enterprise securities  high grade debt having at least an a rating at time of purchase and various money market instruments 
the short term nature of these securities  which currently have an average term of approximately months  decreases the risk of a material loss caused by a market change related to interest rates 
we believe that a hypothetical basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would adversely affect the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and restricted investments by approximately million  or approximately of the aggregate fair value of million  at december  for these reasons  and because these securities are generally held to maturity  we believe we do not have significant exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to our debt securities held as of december  we believe that any interest rate change related to our investment securities held as of december  is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the yield on comparable one year investments was approximately  as compared to our current portfolio yield of approximately 
however  given the short term nature of these securities  a general decline in interest rates may adversely affect the interest earned from our portfolio as securities mature and may be replaced with securities having a lower interest rate 
to minimize our exposure to credit risk  we invest in securities with strong credit ratings and have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturity with the objectives of maintaining safety of principal and liquidity 
we do not invest in derivative financial instruments or auction rate securities  and we generally hold our investments in debt securities until maturity 
however  adverse changes in the credit markets relating to credit risks would adversely affect the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted investments 
the deterioration of the credit markets during the year ended december  had a detrimental effect on our investment portfolio 
during  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our investment in debt securities issued by lbhi 
during the year ended december   the gross unrealized losses in our portfolio increased from million to million 
the majority of these unrealized losses related to our holdings of corporate debt securities 
at december   the fair value of our corporate debt securities was approximately million  or of our total investment portfolio of million 
the remaining securities in our portfolio are either us treasury and agency securities or government sponsored enterprise securities  which we believe are subject to less credit risk 
in the event there is further deterioration in the credit market  the fair value of our corporate debt securities could further decline 
we have an equity investment in aegera  which is a privately held entity 
we are unable to obtain a quoted market price with respect to the fair value of this investment 
we paid million for the aegera investment in december but recorded the investment at million based on the value per share obtained by aegera through external financing earlier in our investment in aegera is denominated in canadian dollars and is subject to foreign currency risk 
the carrying value is adjusted at each reporting date based on current exchange rates  and was million at december  we review the carrying value of the agera investment on a periodic basis for indicators of impairment  and adjust the value accordingly 
the facility leases we entered into during require us to maintain minimum level of restricted investments of approximately million  or million if in the form of cash  as collateral for these facilities 
together with the requirement to maintain up to approximately million in restricted investments with respect to our process development and manufacturing facility leases  and our additional collateral for one of our operating leases  our overall level of restricted investments is currently required to be approximately million 
although the market value for these investments may rise or fall as a result of changes in interest rates  we will be required to maintain this level of restricted investments in either a rising or declining interest rate environment 
our convertible subordinated notes bear interest at fixed rates 
as a result  our interest expense on these notes is not affected by changes in interest rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued during  we established a wholly owned subsidiary  human genome sciences europe gmbh hgs europe that is assisting in our clinical trials and clinical research collaborations in european countries 
although hgs europe s activities are denominated primarily in euros  we believe the foreign currency fluctuation risks to be immaterial to our operations as a whole 
during  we established a wholly owned subsidiary  human genome sciences pacific pty ltd 
hgs pacific that is sponsoring some of our clinical trials in the asia pacific region 
we currently do not anticipate hgs pacific to have any operational activity and therefore we do not believe we will have any foreign currency fluctuation risks with respect to hgs pacific
