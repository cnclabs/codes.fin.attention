table of contents usse conducts business primarily in europe and ussc conducts business primarily in canada 
we are subject to market conditions in those areas which are influenced by many of the same factors that affect us markets  as well as matters specific to international markets such as quotas and tariffs 
like our domestic operations  usse and ussc are affected by worldwide overcapacity in the steel industry  the cyclical nature of demand for steel products and the sensitivity of that demand to worldwide general economic conditions 
usse and ussc are subject to different environmental regulations and other factors in europe and canada  respectively  that could negatively affect results of operations and cash flow 
these environmental regulations and other factors include  but are not limited to  taxation  nationalization  inflation  currency fluctuations  increased regulation  limits on emissions see environmental matters for discussions regarding carbon dioxide emissions limits which are applicable to european union member countries  and carbon dioxide emissions limitations which are expected to come into effect in canada  limits on production  and quotas  tariffs and other protectionist measures 
usse and ussc are affected by volatile raw materials prices  and usse has been affected by curtailments of natural gas available to europe from russia through ukraine 
usss experienced natural gas curtailments during periods of peak demand in eastern europe and russia in  and both ussk and usss experienced a curtailment for more than ten days in january related to russia s suspension of gas shipments to europe

steel  is a consulting company providing engineering services in the mining and mineral processing sectors 
raw materials and energy historically  supplies of raw materials and energy used to produce steel have been more than sufficient and costs were relatively stable 
in the past several years  there has been a tightening of raw material availability and a substantial increase in purchase prices 
the recent significant reduction in global steel production has resulted in decreases in many of these purchase prices 
we expect that such prices will increase when global steel production returns to more customary levels 
as an integrated producer  u 
s 
steel s primary raw materials are iron units in the form of iron ore or taconite  carbon units in the form of coal and coke which is produced from coal and steel scrap 
the amounts of such raw materials needed to produce a ton of steel will fluctuate based upon the specifications of the final steel products  the quality of raw materials and  to a lesser extent  differences among steel producing equipment 
in broad terms  u 
s 
steel estimates that it consumes about tons of coal to produce one ton of coke and that it consumes a little less than tons of coke and over tons of iron ore pellets to produce one ton of raw steel 
we also consume approximately  mmbtu s of natural gas per ton shipped 
while we believe that these estimates are useful for planning purposes  substantial variations occur 
they are presented in order to give a general sense of raw material and energy consumption related to steel production 
iron ore logo the iron ore facilities at minntac and keetac contain an estimated million short tons of recoverable reserves 
our proportionate share of recoverable reserves at the wabush  hibbing and tilden joint ventures is million short tons 
recoverable tons means the tons of product that can be used internally or delivered to a customer after considering mining and beneficiation or preparation losses 
at high levels of steelmaking production  we could be one to two million tons short of our flat rolled segment s annual requirements 
any shortfalls would be purchased from outside sources  although we expect to be self sufficient in we previously announced a capital investment program at keetac to increase production by modernizing and improving a pellet indurating line that has been idle since this expansion would return us to a position of being able to fully satisfy our north american pellet requirements at all operating levels

steel operates cokemaking facilities at the clairton plant of mon valley works  at gary works and at granite city works 
we routinely sell or swap a portion of the coke production from our clairton facility 
in canada  we operate cokemaking facilities at hamilton works and lake erie works  which serve the steelmaking operations at ussc 
depending on production levels  we may purchase additional coke on the open market 
to the extent that it is necessary or appropriate considering existing needs and or applicable transportation costs  coke is purchased from or swapped with north american and international suppliers or other end users 
the increase in coke production in was mainly due to the inclusion of production at lake erie works and hamilton works for the entire year 
production had been decreasing over the last several years due mainly to the declining condition of the coke batteries at our clairton plant and the idling of one of the coke batteries at gary works in october we are planning a significant capital investment over a period of years for new coke oven batteries at our clairton plant  replacing existing batteries that are nearing the end of their useful lives and rehabilitating several other existing batteries 
we are currently in the first phase of this investment  which includes construction of a technologically and environmentally advanced coke battery that will replace the current capacity of three older units  and rehabilitation of several existing coke batteries 
also  gateway is in the process of constructing a coke plant to supply granite city works  while we are constructing a cogeneration facility that will utilize by products and that we will own and operate 
usse operates cokemaking facilities that primarily serve the steelmaking operations at ussk and may occasionally supply a portion of usss s needs

about percent of our canadian gas purchases are based on solicited bids  on a monthly basis  from various vendors  and the remainder are made daily or with physical forward positions 
we have executed physical forward positions consistent with anticipated business needs for natural gas because of the volatility of natural gas markets 
we believe that supplies adequate to meet usse s needs are normally available at competitive market prices 
natural gas prices in slovakia and serbia have been less volatile than in the united states  however  prices have increased over the last several years 
usse is dependent upon availability of natural gas from russia through ukraine 
usss experienced natural gas curtailments during periods of peak demand in eastern europe and russia in  and both ussk and usss experienced a curtailment of more than ten days in january related to russia s suspension of gas shipments to europe 
both flat rolled and usse use self generated coke oven and blast furnace gas to reduce consumption of natural gas 
commercial sales of product u

steel  is charged with reviewing our overall performance with various environmental compliance programs 
also  u 
s 
steel  largely through the american iron and steel institute  the canadian steel producers association  the world steel association and eurofer  is involved in the promotion of cost effective environmental strategies through the development of appropriate air  water  waste and climate change laws and regulations at the local  state  national and international levels 
u 
s 
steel s businesses in the united states are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act caa with respect to air emissions  the clean water act cwa with respect to water discharges  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances 
in addition  all states where u 
s 
steel operates have similar laws dealing with the same matters 
these laws are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly stringent 
the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable due in part to the fact that certain implementing regulations for these environmental laws have not yet been promulgated and in certain instances are undergoing revision 
these environmental laws and regulations  particularly the caa  could result in substantially increased capital  operating and compliance costs 
ussc is subject to the environmental laws of canada  which are comparable to environmental standards in the united states 
environmental regulation in canada is an area of shared responsibility between the federal government and the provincial governments  which in turn delegate certain matters to municipal governments 
federal environmental statutes include the federal canadian environmental protection act  and the fisheries act 
various provincial statutes regulate environmental matters such as the release and remediation of hazardous substances  waste storage  treatment and disposal  and air emissions 
as in the united states  canadian environmental laws federal  provincial and local are undergoing revisions and becoming more stringent 
ussk is subject to the environmental laws of slovakia and the eu 
a related law of the eu commonly known as reach registration  evaluation  authorisation and restriction of chemicals  regulation requires the registration of certain substances that are produced in the eu or imported into the eu 
ussk pre registered various substances during the six month pre registration period that ended november   both on its own behalf and on behalf of u 
s 
steel and certain of its subsidiaries that may be shipping products into the eu 
ussk is compliant with reach and intends to register its substances by the applicable deadlines to remain in compliance and be able to continue its businesses without material change 
usss is subject to the environmental laws of serbia 
under the terms of the acquisition in  usss is responsible for only those costs and liabilities associated with environmental events occurring subsequent to the completion of an environmental baseline study in june  which was submitted to the government of serbia 
in january  usss entered into an agreement with the serbian government that commits us to spend approximately million before the end of to improve the environmental performance of our facilities 
spending for this commitment in was million 
the spending is focused on projects aimed at reducing air particulate emissions 
many nations  including the united states  are considering regulation of carbon dioxide co emissions 
international negotiations to supplement or replace the kyoto protocol are ongoing 
the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create co emissions 
this distinguishes integrated steel producers from mini mills and many other industries where co generation is generally linked to energy usage 
the eu has established greenhouse gas regulations  canada has published details of a regulatory framework for greenhouse gas emissions as discussed below  and the united states may establish regulations in the future 
such regulations may entail substantial capital expenditures  restrict production  and raise the price of coal and other carbon based energy sources 
to comply with the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change  the european commission ec created an emissions trading system ets 
under the ets  the ec establishes co emissions limits for every eu member state and approves grants of co emission allowances to individual emitting facilities pursuant to national allocation plans that are proposed by each of the member states 
emission allowances can be bought and sold by emitting facilities to cover the quantities of co they emit in their 
table of contents operations 
in  the ec approved slovakia s national allocation plan for the period through nap i  which granted ussk fewer emissions allowances than were ultimately required 
ussk purchased allowances to cover its shortfall for the nap l allocation period 
based on the actual value of allowances purchased  a short term other liability of million was recognized on the balance sheet as of december  this amount was settled in in july  following approval by the ec of slovakia s national allocation plan for the to trading period nap ii  slovakia granted ussk more co

based on actual carbon emissions in  we believe that ussk will have sufficient emissions allowances for the nap ii period without purchasing additional allowances 
on april   canada s federal government announced an action plan to reduce greenhouse gases and air pollution the plan 
the federal government plans to set mandatory reduction targets on all major greenhouse gas producing industries to achieve an absolute reduction of megatonnes in greenhouse gas emissions from levels by on march   canada s federal government published details of its regulatory framework for industrial greenhouse gas emissions the framework 
the plan and the framework provide that facilities existing in will be required to cut their greenhouse gas emissions intensity by percent by  with a further two percent reduction in each following year 
companies will be able to choose the most cost effective way to meet their targets from a range of options 
the framework effectively exempts fixed process emissions of co  which could exclude certain iron and steel producing co emissions from mandatory reductions 
certain provinces have enacted climate change rules and ontario may also do so 
the impact on ussc cannot be estimated at this time 
in the united states  the new administration has announced its commitment to implement a national cap and trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by percent by the parameters and timetable of this proposed program have not been announced so it is impossible to estimate its impact on u 
s 
steel  although it could be significant 
u 
s 
steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations 
in recent years  these expenditures have been mainly for process changes in order to meet caa obligations and similar obligations in europe and canada  although ongoing compliance costs have also been significant 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of u 
s 
steel s products and services  operating results will be reduced 
u 
s 
steel believes that our major north american and many european integrated steel competitors are confronted by substantially similar conditions and thus does not believe that its relative position with regard to such competitors is materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations 
however  the costs and operating restrictions necessary for compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our competitive position with regard to domestic mini mills  some foreign steel producers particularly in developing economies such as china and producers of materials which compete with steel  all of which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 
in addition  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods 
u 
s 
steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to our prior disposal of environmentally sensitive materials 
many of our competitors have fewer historical liabilities

air the caa imposes stringent limits on air emissions with a federally mandated operating permit program and civil and criminal enforcement sanctions 
the caa requires  among other things  the regulation of hazardous air pollutants through the development and promulgation of maximum achievable control technology mact standards 
the us environmental protection agency epa has developed various industry specific mact standards pursuant to this requirement 
the caa requires epa to promulgate regulations establishing emission standards for each category of hazardous air pollutants 
epa must also conduct risk assessments on each source category that is already subject to mact standards and determine if additional standards are needed to reduce residual risks 

table of contents the principal impact of the mact standards on u 
s 
steel operations includes those that are specific to cokemaking  ironmaking  steelmaking and iron ore processing 
the emission limitations for ironmaking and steelmaking sources could become more stringent if epa s residual risk analysis indicates that additional controls are necessary 
epa is required to complete this residual risk analysis by the impact of this risk analysis and any subsequent changes cannot be estimated at this time 
u 
s 
steel s cokemaking facilities are subject to two categories of mact standards 
the first category applies to pushing and quenching 
epa is required to make a risk based determination for pushing and quenching emissions and determine whether additional emissions reductions are necessary from this process by epa has yet to publish or propose any residual risk standards from these operations  therefore  the impact cannot be estimated at this time 
the second category of mact standards applying to coke facilities applies to emissions from charging  coke oven battery tops  and coke oven doors 
with regard to these standards  u 
s 
steel chose to install more stringent controls than mact on some of its batteries  called lowest achievable emissions reductions laer 
such laer batteries are not required to comply with certain residual risk standards until because the scope of these anticipated changes are distant and relatively uncertain  the magnitude of the impact of these anticipated changes cannot be estimated at this time 
u 
s 
steel s iron ore processing operations are subject to the taconite iron ore processing mact standards 
these standards may change if epa revises the mact standards in response to a petition filed by an environmental advocacy group 
in addition  epa will make a risk based determination for taconite iron ore processing and determine whether additional emissions reductions are necessary from this process by epa has yet to publish or propose any residual risk standards from these operations  therefore  the impact of any changes cannot be estimated at this time 
the caa also requires epa to develop and implement national ambient air quality standards naaqs for criteria pollutants  which include  among others  particulate matter and ozone 
in  epa established hour and annual standards for fine particles that are less than micrometers in size and in  epa tightened the hour standard but retained the annual standard 
states are required to demonstrate compliance with the fine particle standard by april  with a possible extension to april on december   epa designated areas in which u 
s 
steel operates as nonattainment and unclassified attainment for the fine particle standard 
state implementation plans for the standard are expected to be due in early  with attainment demonstrations with the standard expected to be made between and it is anticipated that epa s fine particle programs could result in significant costs to u 
s 
steel  however  it is impossible to estimate the magnitude of these costs at this time as state and federal agencies are still developing regulations for the programs and implementation is not expected until later in standard and in standard 
effective may  epa lowered its ground level ozone air quality standards  which could affect sources of nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds  which include coke plants  and iron and steel facilities 
epa is required to issue final designations of attainment  nonattainment and unclassifiable areas no later than march unless there is insufficient information to make these designation decisions 
in that case  epa will issue designations no later than march states must submit state implementation plans outlining how they will reduce pollution to meet the standards by a date that is no later than three years after epa s final designations 
if epa issues designations in or  these plans would be due no later than or  respectively 
states are required to meet the standards by deadlines that may vary based on the severity of the problem in the area 
it is anticipated that the ozone naaqs revisions could result in significant costs to u 
s 
steel  however  it is impossible to estimate the magnitude of these costs at this time since the implementation dates are unknown and distant

risk factors risk factors concerning the current global recession the volatile global economic climate is having significant negative effects on our business and our forward view is limited because of low order backlogs and short lead times 
all segments of our business have been impacted and such impacts have created certain new risks and have also affected the other risks set forth below 
u 
s 
steel s end product markets have been severely affected 
our flat rolled and european segments sell to the automotive  appliance and construction related industries  all of which have reported substantially lower customer demand due to the ongoing global recession 
prices for both oil and natural gas have fallen dramatically and this has led to a substantial decrease in oil and gas drilling activity  which has resulted in lower customer demand for our tubular segment 
as a result  u 
s 
steel s operating levels have fallen and will remain at depressed levels until our customers demand increases 

table of contents in addition to slackening demand by end customers  we believe that some of our customers are experiencing difficulty in obtaining credit or maintaining their ability to qualify for trade credit insurance  resulting in a further reduction in purchases and an increase in our credit risk exposure 
the duration of the recession and the trajectory of the recovery for these industries may have a significant impact on u 
s 
steel 
u 
s 
steel may not be able to access financial markets and there may be difficulty drawing upon existing financial agreements 
given the current economic environment  it is unclear on what terms if any we could access the capital markets 
lehman brothers commercial bank lehman holds a million commitment in our million credit facility credit facility 
with the bankruptcy filing by lehman s parent  we do not know if lehman could or would fund its share of the commitment 
other lenders may be facing financial difficulties and may be unable or unwilling to honor a draw request 
accordingly  there may be a reduction of the sums normally available under our credit facilities 
this decrease in available credit may increase the risk of our customers defaulting on their payment obligations to u 
s 
steel and may cause some of our suppliers to be delayed in filling or to be unable to fill our needs 
customer defaults may trigger repurchases or reduce the availability under our accounts receivables facility 
in addition  that facility is funded by the sale of commercial paper by the purchasers so volatility in the commercial paper market may increase costs under that facility 
interest rates under the credit facility  our other variable rate credit facilities and our term loans may be set by auction among the lenders or as a margin over published rates such as the london interbank offered rate and the fed funds rate  which may result in substantially higher interest rates 
u 
s 
steel may face increased risks of customer and supplier defaults 
there is an increased risk of insolvency and other credit related issues of our customers  particularly those in hard hit industries such as automotive  construction and appliance 
also  there is the possibility that our suppliers may face similar risks 
u 
s 
steel s joint ventures and other equity investees are also being affected by the current global recession 
u 
s 
steel s joint ventures and other equity affiliates are also engaged in the production of raw materials and the production or sales of flat rolled and tubular products 
as such they face many of the same issues previously described concerning u 
s 
steel 
since these entities are smaller than u 
s 
steel they may have fewer resources available to them to respond to the current global recession 
risk factors concerning the steel industry steel consumption is cyclical and worldwide overcapacity in the steel industry and the availability of alternative products have resulted in intense competition  which may have an adverse effect on profitability and cash flow  especially during periods of economic weakness 
steel consumption is highly cyclical and generally follows economic and industrial conditions both worldwide and in regional markets 
the steel industry has historically been characterized by excess world supply  which has led to substantial price decreases during periods of economic weakness 
the current economic downturn has decreased the demand for our products and is negatively affecting our profitability and cash flow 
substitute materials are increasingly available for many steel products  which further reduces demand for steel 
rapidly growing supply in china and other developing economies  which may increase faster than increases in demand in those economies  may result in additional excess worldwide capacity and falling steel prices 
over the last several years  steel consumption in china and other developing economies has increased at a rapid pace 
steel companies have responded by developing plans to rapidly increase steel production capability in these countries 
steel production  especially in china  has expanded rapidly and appears to be well in excess of chinese demand 
because china is now the largest worldwide steel producer by a significant margin  any significant excess chinese capacity could have a major impact on world steel trade and prices if this excess and subsidized 
table of contents production is exported to other markets 
since the chinese steel industry is largely government owned  it may not be as adversely impacted by the current world financial situation and it may make production and sales decisions for non market reasons 
increased imports of steel products into north america and europe could negatively affect steel prices and demand levels and reduce our profitability 
steel imports to the united states accounted for an estimated percent of the domestic steel market in  percent in and percent in foreign competitors may have lower labor costs  and some are owned  controlled or subsidized by their governments  which allows their production and pricing decisions to be influenced by political and economic policy considerations as well as prevailing market conditions 
the expiration in of a number of antidumping and countervailing duty orders may facilitate additional imports in and beyond 
in addition  the recent strengthening of the us dollar makes imports more attractive to steel purchasers in the united states 
imports of tubular products increased significantly in oil country tubular goods octg accounted for a large share of the growth as they have more than doubled over levels 
imports of octg from china registered the most dramatic increase as they grew from  tons in to nearly million tons in the us market experienced a surge in tubular imports in the second half of that resulted in record octg inventories by the end of the year  which is expected to affect demand in imports of flat rolled steel to canada accounted for an estimated percent of the canadian market for flat rolled steel products in  percent in and percent in total imports of flat rolled carbon steel products to the eu were percent of the eu market in  percent in and percent in increases in future levels of imported steel to north america and europe could reduce future market prices and demand levels for steel products produced in those markets 
imports into the united states  canada and the european union have often violated the international trade laws of these jurisdictions 
while in some cases u 
s 
steel and others have been successful in obtaining relief under these laws  in other circumstances relief has not been received 
when received  such relief is generally subject to automatic or discretionary recision or reduction 
there can be no assurance that any such relief will be obtained or continued in the future or that such relief as obtained will be adequate 
increases in prices and limited availability of raw materials and energy may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 
steel producers require large amounts of raw materials iron ore or other iron containing material  steel scrap  coke  coal  zinc  tin and other metallic additions for integrated producers such as u 
s 
steel  and scrap  zinc and other metallic additions for mini mill producers 
both integrated and mini mill producers consume large amounts of energy 
over the last several years  prices for raw materials and energy have increased significantly 
in many cases these prices have increased by a greater percentage or have decreased more slowly than the selling prices for steel products 
u 
s 
steel and other steel producers have periodically been faced with problems in obtaining sufficient raw materials and energy in a timely manner due to shortages or transportation problems such as shortages of barges  ocean vessels  rail cars or trucks  or unavailability of rail lines or of locks on the great lakes  resulting in production curtailments 
usse is dependent upon availability of natural gas from russia through ukraine 
usse experienced natural gas curtailments during periods of peak demand in eastern europe and russia in and during russia s suspension of gas shipments to europe in january resulting production curtailments and escalated costs have reduced profit margins and any future curtailments and escalated costs may reduce profit margins 
environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 
steel producers in the united states are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these laws continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly stringent 
the 
table of contents ultimate impact of complying with such laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision 
environmental laws and regulations  particularly the clean air act  could result in substantially increased capital  operating and compliance costs 
international environmental requirements vary 
while standards in the european union  canada and japan are generally comparable to us standards  other nations  particularly china  have substantially lesser requirements that may give competitors in such nations a competitive advantage 
risk factors concerning u 
s 
steel legacy obligations our retiree employee health care and retiree life insurance plan costs  most of which are unfunded obligations  and our pension plan costs in north america are higher than those of many of our competitors 
these plans create a competitive disadvantage and negatively affect our profitability and cash flow 
we maintain defined benefit retiree health care and life insurance and defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans covering most of our north american employees and former employees upon their retirement 
as of december   approximately  current employees  retirees and beneficiaries are participating in the plans to receive pension and or medical benefits 
at december   u 
s 
steel s benefit obligations for retiree medical and life insurance exceeded trust assets by billion  an increase of million from the amount at the end of the funded status of the projected pension benefit obligation decreased from a net overfunded position of million at year end to a net underfunded position of billion at year end most of our other benefits and pension benefits are subject to collective bargaining agreements with unionized workforces and will be subject to future negotiations 
minimum contributions to domestic qualified pension plans are controlled under erisa and other government regulations 
minimum contributions to ussc pension plans are governed by an agreement entered into by stelco and the province of ontario that u 
s 
steel assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of stelco 
this agreement requires defined annual contributions until the earlier of full solvency funding for the four main plans or until december   when minimum funding requirements for the plans resume under the provincial pension legislation 
substantial cash contributions may be required to fund other benefits and pensions 
total costs for pension plans and other benefits are expected to be approximately million in  an increase of million from many domestic and international competitors do not provide defined benefit retiree health care and life insurance and pension plans  and other international competitors operate in jurisdictions with government sponsored health care plans that may offer them a cost advantage 
benefit obligations under our plans are not tied to operating rates  therefore  our costs are not expected to decline as a result of the current global recession or any other future economic downturns 
u 
s 
steel contributes to a multiemployer plan in the united states covering pensions for usw represented workers formerly employed by national steel and workers hired after may we have legal and contractual requirements for future funding of this plan  which will have a negative effect on our cash flows 
the collective bargaining agreements with the usw entered into effective september  the cbas increased our required contributions to this plan from to per hour worked 
in addition  funding requirements for participants could increase as a result of any underfunding of this plan 
the recent turmoil in financial markets has led to significant declines in the value of equity investments that are held by the trusts under our pension plans and the trust to pay for retiree health care and life insurance benefits  which has contributed to the underfunded position at december  since the pension protection act of was enacted  u 
s 
steel has not been required to make mandatory contributions to our main us pension plan 
such contributions may be required in the future 

table of contents we have higher environmental remediation costs than our competitors 
this creates a competitive disadvantage and negatively affects our profitability and cash flow 
u 
s 
steel is involved in numerous remediation projects at currently operating facilities  facilities that have been closed or sold to unrelated parties and other sites where material generated by u 
s 
steel was deposited 
in addition  there are numerous other former operating or disposal sites that could become the subject of remediation 
environmental remediation costs and related cash requirements of many of our competitors may be substantially less than ours 
many international competitors do not face similar laws in the jurisdictions where they operate 
many us competitors have substantially shorter operating histories than we do  resulting in less exposure for environmental remediation 
competitors that have obtained relief under bankruptcy laws may have been released from certain environmental obligations that existed prior to the bankruptcy filing 
other risk factors applicable to u 
s 
steel unplanned equipment outages and other unforeseen disruptions may reduce our results of operations 
our steel production depends on the operation of critical pieces of equipment  such as blast furnaces  casters and hot strip mills 
it is possible that we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to equipment failures at our facilities or those of our key suppliers 
it is also possible that operations may be disrupted due to other unforeseen circumstances such as power outages  explosions  fires  floods  accidents and severe weather conditions 
production at usse was curtailed in january due to the suspension of natural gas deliveries to europe from russia and we remain vulnerable to this risk 
availability of raw materials and delivery of products to customers could be affected by logistical disruptions such as shortages of barges  ocean vessels  rail cars or trucks  or unavailability of rail lines or of locks on the great lakes 
to the extent that lost production could not be compensated for at unaffected facilities and depending on the length of the outage  our sales and our unit production costs could be adversely affected 
we may be unable to recover cost increases as we supply customers with steel under long term fixed price sales contracts 
historically approximately percent of u 
s 
steel s flat rolled product sales in the united states have been based on sales contracts with durations of at least one year 
these contracts generally have a fixed price or a price that will fluctuate with changes in a defined index 
to the extent that raw materials  energy  labor or other costs increase over the terms of the various contracts  u 
s 
steel may not be able to recover these cost increases from customers with fixed price agreements 
while u 
s 
steel may from time to time enter into forward purchase contracts to establish future prices for a portion of our requirements  we would remain at risk for our remaining requirements and would create another risk in the event that future prices decline below the prices that the forward purchases have established 
declines in the production levels of our major customers and customer payment defaults could have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
flat rolled and usse sell to the automotive  appliance and construction related industries  all of which have reported substantially lower customer demand due to the ongoing global recession 
prices for both oil and natural gas have fallen dramatically leading to a reduction in oil and gas exploration and development  which in turn has resulted in lower customer demand for our tubular segment 
in addition to slackening demand by end customers  we believe that some of our customers are experiencing difficulty in obtaining credit  which has further reduced their purchases from us 
the duration of the recession and the trajectory of the recovery for these industries may have a significant impact on u 
s 
steel 
in some cases  these difficulties may result in bankruptcy filings or cessation of operations 
if customers experiencing financial problems default on paying amounts owed to us  we may not be able to collect these amounts 
any material payment defaults by our customers could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the decrease in available credit may increase the risk of our customers defaulting on their payment obligations to u 
s 
steel and may cause some of our suppliers to be delayed in filling 
table of contents or unable to fill our needs 
customer defaults may trigger repurchases or reduce the availability under our accounts receivables facility 
in addition  that facility is funded by the sale of commercial paper by the purchasers so volatility in the commercial paper market may increase costs under that facility 
the terms of our indebtedness contain provisions that may limit our flexibility 
in  we entered into a five year million revolving credit facility credit facility and five year and three year term loan facilities both in the amount of million term loan facilities  with million outstanding under the term loan facilities at december  these facilities include an interest coverage ratio consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to consolidated interest expense covenant of and a leverage ratio consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda covenant of we also issued billion of senior notes in that contain covenants restricting our ability to create liens and engage in sale leasebacks and requiring the repurchase of the senior notes upon a change of control under specified circumstances  as well as other customary provisions 
compliance with these covenants will depend upon future operating results and other factors that are at least partially outside of our control 
these covenants may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities 
rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings  which would make it more difficult for us to raise capital and would increase our financial costs 
any downgrade in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult  may increase the cost and affect the terms of future borrowings  may affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services  and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities 
change in control clauses in our financial and labor agreements grant the other party rights to accelerate obligations and to terminate or extend our labor agreements  upon the occurrence of change in control events specified in our senior notes  credit facility  term loan facilities and various other contracts and leases  the holders of our indebtedness may require us to immediately repurchase or repay that debt on less than favorable terms 
additionally  the cbas give the usw the right to either terminate or extend the collective bargaining agreements for an additional four years 
a change of control is generally defined to include any of the following a the acquisition by a person or group of at least percent of our common stock  b a merger in which holders of our common stock own less than a majority of the equity in the resulting entity  or c replacement of a majority of the members of our board of directors 
our operations expose us to uncertainties and risks in the countries in which we operate  which could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow 
our us operations are subject to economic conditions and political factors in the united states  which if changed could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow 
political factors include  but are not limited to  taxation  inflation  increased regulation  limitations on exports of energy and raw materials  and trade remedies 
actions taken by the new us administration could affect our results of operations and cash flow 
ussk  located in slovakia  usss  located in serbia  and ussc  located in canada  constitute percent of our total raw steel production capability 
all of them are subject to economic conditions and political factors in the countries in which they are located  and ussk is additionally subject to economic conditions and political factors associated with the european union and the euro currency 
changes in any of these economic conditions or political factors could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow 
political factors include  but are not limited to  taxation  nationalization  inflation  government instability  civil unrest  increased regulation and quotas  tariffs and other protectionist measures 
any future foreign acquisitions would expose us to similar risks 

table of contents we are subject to significant foreign currency risks  which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows 
our foreign operations accounted for approximately percent of our net sales in the financial condition and results of operations of ussk  usss and ussc are reported in various foreign currencies and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements 
the appreciation of the us dollar against these foreign currencies could have a negative impact on our consolidated profitability 
in addition  the acquisition of ussc was funded from the united states  as well as through the reinvestment of undistributed foreign earnings from usse  creating intercompany monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities involved  which can have a non cash impact on income when they are remeasured at the end of each quarter 
an million us dollar denominated intercompany loan to a european affiliate was the primary exposure at december  any future foreign acquisitions would expose us to similar risks 
greenhouse gas policies could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create carbon dioxide co this distinguishes integrated steel producers from mini mills and many other industries where co generation is generally linked to energy usage 
the european union eu has established greenhouse gas regulations and canada and the united states may also do so 
these limitations could have a negative effect on income and cash flows 
since mini mill production does not involve the same chemical reactions as integrated production  mini mills may have a competitive advantage 
also since china and many other developing nations have not instituted greenhouse gas regulations  and since past international agreements such as the kyoto protocol provided exemptions and lesser standards for developing nations  we may also be at a competitive disadvantage 
the new us administration has announced its commitment to implement a national cap and trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by percent by the parameters and timetable of this proposed program have not been announced but it could have a negative impact on production levels  income and cash flows 
furthermore  it could have negative impacts on our suppliers and customers that could result in higher costs and lower sales for us 
on april   canada s federal government announced an action plan to reduce greenhouse gases and air pollution 
the federal government plans to set mandatory reduction targets on all major greenhouse gas producing industries to achieve an absolute reduction of megatonnes in greenhouse gas emissions from levels by facilities existing in will be required to cut their greenhouse gas emissions intensity by percent by  with a further two percent reduction in each following year 
companies will be able to choose the most cost effective way to meet their targets from a range of options 
environment canada has indicated that the proposed rules will contain exemptions for fixed process gas emissions industries  including steel  for which an exemption of percent of greenhouse gas emissions is contemplated 
certain provinces have enacted climate change rules and ontario may also do so 
these limitations could have a negative effect on income and cash flows 
the european commission ec has established a co emission trading scheme for eu member countries 
under this program slovakia has received fewer co emissions allowances than it requested for both the first period through and second period through 
the slovak ministry of the environment  in turn  awarded ussk fewer allowances than ussk had requested for both periods 
ussk purchased emissions allowances to cover its shortfall for the first period and  as to future periods  we may be required to reduce ussk s production or purchase emission allowances  either of which may have a negative impact on income and cash flows 
our business requires substantial expenditures for debt service  contingent obligations  capital investment  operating leases and maintenance that we may be unable to fund 
with  million of debt outstanding as of december   we have significant debt service requirements 
our operations are capital intensive 
for the five year period ended december   total capital expenditures were billion  including million of expenditures by gateway energy coke company  llc gateway 
table of contents that are consolidated in our financial results based on financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r 
at december   our contract commitments to acquire property  plant and equipment totaled million and we were obligated to make aggregate lease payments of million under operating leases 
we are planning a significant capital investment over a period of years for new coke oven batteries at our clairton plant  replacing existing batteries that are nearing the end of their useful lives and rehabilitating several other existing batteries 
we are currently in the first phase of this investment  which includes construction of a technologically and environmentally advanced coke battery that will replace the current capacity of three older units  and rehabilitation of several existing coke batteries 
also  gateway is in the process of constructing a coke plant to supply granite city works and we are constructing a cogeneration facility that will utilize by products and that we will own and operate 
should we choose to defer capital expenditures to conserve cash  it could become more expensive to complete such deferred projects in the future 
in addition to capital expenditures and lease payments  we spend significant amounts for maintenance of raw material  raw steel and steel finishing production facilities 
as of december   we had contingent obligations consisting of indemnity obligations under active surety bonds  trusts and letters of credit totaling approximately million  operating lease obligations of approximately million that may be declared immediately due and payable in the event of the bankruptcy of marathon oil corporation  and contractual purchase commitments under purchase orders and take or pay arrangements of approximately billion 
our business may not generate sufficient operating cash flow  or external financing sources may not be available in amounts sufficient  to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
we intend indefinitely to reinvest undistributed foreign earnings outside the united states  however  if we need to repatriate funds in the future to satisfy our liquidity needs  the tax consequences would reduce income and cash flow 
we have approximately billion of revolving credit facilities and a million accounts receivable securitization facility  which provide us with available financing to meet our cash needs 
in light of the current volatile market environment  we may not be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under these facilities 
u 
s 
steel is exposed to uninsured losses 
u 
s 
steel s insurance coverage against catastrophic casualty and business interruption exposures contains certain common exclusions  substantial deductibles and self insurance retentions 
our collective bargaining agreements may limit our flexibility 
most hourly employees of u 
s 
steel s flat rolled  tubular  cokemaking and iron ore pellet facilities in the united states are covered by the cbas  which expire in september these agreements contain provisions that prohibit us from pursuing any north american transaction involving steel or steel related assets without the consent of the usw  grant the usw a right to bid on any sale of one or more facilities covered by the cbas  require us to make reasonable and necessary capital expenditures to maintain the competitive status of our domestic facilities and require mandatory pre funding of a trust for retiree health care and life insurance 
these agreements also restrict our ability to trade  sell or use foreign produced coke and iron ore in north america  and further require that the ratio of non usw employees to usw employees at our domestic facilities not exceed one to five 
while other domestic integrated unionized steel producers have similar requirements in their agreements with the usw  some foreign and non union domestic producers are not subject to such requirements 
there are risks associated with past acquisitions  as well as any acquisitions we may make in the future 
the lone star and stelco acquisitions created billion of goodwill on our balance sheet as of december   which exposes us to the risk of future impairment charges 

table of contents the lone star acquisition increased our tubular production capacity by more than percent and the stelco acquisition increased our north american steelmaking capability by percent  thereby increasing our exposure to cyclical downturns in historically cyclical industries such as oil and gas  service center  conversion  automotive  construction and appliance 
the success of any future acquisitions will depend substantially on the accuracy of our analysis concerning such businesses and our ability to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms  to finance such acquisitions and to integrate the acquired operations successfully with existing operations 
if we are unable to integrate new operations successfully  our financial results and business reputation could suffer 
our recent acquisitions involved purchase prices significantly higher than the prices we paid for our acquisitions in such prices will make it more difficult to achieve adequate financial returns 
additional risks associated with acquisitions are the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies  the possible assumption of unknown liabilities  potential disputes with the sellers  and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have limited or no prior experience 
international acquisitions may present unique challenges and increase the company s exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations and countries 
antitrust and similar laws in foreign jurisdictions may prevent us from completing acquisitions 
we may be subject to litigation  the disposition of which could negatively affect our profitability and cash flow in a particular period 
our profitability or cash flow in a particular period could be affected by an adverse ruling in any litigation currently pending in the courts or by litigation that may be filed against us in the future 
for information regarding our current significant legal proceedings  see item legal proceedings 
provisions of delaware law  our governing documents and our rights plan may make a takeover of u 
s 
steel more difficult 
certain provisions of delaware law  our certificate of incorporation and by laws and our rights plan could make more difficult or delay our acquisition by means of a tender offer  a proxy contest or otherwise and the removal of incumbent directors 
these provisions are intended to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids  even though such a transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market price 
we may suffer employment losses  which could negatively affect our future performance 
a significant number of u 
s 
steel s us based non represented employees will be eligible for retirement over the next several years 
over the last few years we have intensified our recruitment  training and retention efforts so that we may continue to optimally staff our operations 
failure to do so could negatively affect our future performance 
in response to the current economic situation  we have laid off many employees mainly at our idled facilities  have placed a temporary freeze on hiring and have offered a voluntary early retirement program verp to certain non represented employees 
we are closely monitoring the impact of these actions to ensure that long term staffing needs of our company will be met 
approximately employees accepted the verp and the majority will be retiring on february  the current cost reduction actions will increase the number of personnel and organization changes and may increase the risk of internal control failures 
we are monitoring these changes closely and expanding our training program 
we may experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource planning erp system 
we are currently implementing an erp system to help us operate more efficiently 
this is a complex project  which is expected to be implemented in several phases over the next several years 
we may not be able to successfully implement the erp program without experiencing difficulties 
in addition  the expected benefits of implementing the erp system may not be realized or the costs of implementation may outweigh the realized benefits 
we recently extended the implementation schedule to reduce near term costs 
this action will delay the realization of benefits from this project and may add to final project costs

steel is the subject of  or a party to  a number of pending or threatened legal actions  contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters  including laws and regulations relating to the environment 
certain of these matters are included below in this discussion 
the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could  individually or in the aggregate  be material to the financial statements

general litigation in march  the indiana court of appeals reversed a previous decision of the indiana utilities regulatory commission involving a rate escalation provision in u

table of contents in a series of lawsuits filed in federal court in the northern district of illinois beginning september   individual direct or indirect buyers of steel products have asserted that eight steel manufacturers  including u 
s 
steel  conspired in violation of antitrust laws to restrict the domestic production of raw steel and thereby to fix  raise  maintain or stabilize the price of steel products in the united states 
the cases are filed as class actions and claim treble damages for the period to present  but do not allege any damage amounts 
u 
s 
steel will vigorously defend these lawsuits and does not believe that it has any liability regarding these matters 
asbestos litigation as of december   u 
s 
steel was a defendant in approximately active cases involving approximately  plaintiffs claims 
at december   u 
s 
steel was a defendant in approximately active cases involving approximately  plaintiffs 
during  settlements and dismissals resulted in the disposition of approximately claims and u 
s 
steel paid approximately million in settlements 
new filings added approximately claims 
almost  or approximately percent  of these claims are currently pending in jurisdictions which permit filings with massive numbers of plaintiffs 
of these claims  about  are pending in mississippi and about  are pending in texas 
based upon u 
s 
steel s experience in such cases  it believes that the actual number of plaintiffs who ultimately assert claims against u 
s 
steel will likely be a small fraction of the total number of plaintiffs 
mississippi and texas have amended their laws to curtail mass filings 
as a consequence  most of the claims filed in and involve individual or small groups of claimants 
historically  these claims against u 
s 
steel fall into three major groups claims made by persons who allegedly were exposed to asbestos at u 
s 
steel facilities referred to as premises claims  claims made by industrial workers allegedly exposed to products formerly manufactured by u 
s 
steel  and claims made under certain federal and general maritime laws by employees of former operations of u 
s 
steel 
in general  the only insurance available to u 
s 
steel with respect to asbestos claims is excess casualty insurance  which has multi million dollar self insured retentions 
to date  u 
s 
steel has received minimal payments under these policies relating to asbestos claims 
these asbestos cases allege a variety of respiratory and other diseases based on alleged exposure to asbestos 
u 
s 
steel is currently a defendant in cases in which a total of approximately plaintiffs allege that they are suffering from mesothelioma 
the potential for damages against defendants may be greater in cases in which the plaintiffs can prove mesothelioma 
in many cases in which claims have been asserted against u 
s 
steel  the plaintiffs have been unable to establish any causal relationship to u 
s 
steel or our products or premises  however  with the decline in mass plaintiff cases the incidence of claimants actually alleging a claim against u 
s 
steel is increasing 
in addition  in many asbestos cases  the plaintiffs have been unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any identifiable injury or compensable loss at all  that any injuries that they have incurred did in fact result from alleged exposure to asbestos  or that such alleged exposure was in any way related to u 
s 
steel or our products or premises 
in every asbestos case in which u 
s 
steel is named as a party  the complaints are filed against numerous named defendants and generally do not contain allegations regarding specific monetary damages sought 
to the extent that any specific amount of damages is sought  the amount applies to claims against all named defendants and in no case is there any allegation of monetary damages against u 
s 
steel 
historically  approximately percent of the cases against u 
s 
steel did not specify any damage amount or stated that the damages sought exceeded the amount required to establish jurisdiction of the court in which the case was filed 
jurisdictional amounts generally range from  to  u 
s 
steel does not consider the amount of damages alleged  if any  in a complaint to be relevant in assessing our potential exposure to asbestos liabilities 
the ultimate outcome of any claim depends upon a myriad of legal and factual issues  including whether the plaintiff can prove actual disease  if any  actual exposure  if any  to u 
s 
steel products  or the duration of exposure to asbestos  if any  on u 
s 
steel s premises 
u 
s 
steel has noted over the years that the form of complaint including its allegations  if any  concerning damages often depends upon the form of complaint filed by particular law firms and attorneys 
often the same damage allegation will be in multiple complaints regardless of the number of plaintiffs  the number of defendants  or any specific diseases or conditions alleged 

table of contents u 
s 
steel aggressively pursues grounds for the dismissal of u 
s 
steel from pending cases and litigates cases to verdict where we believe litigation is appropriate 
u 
s 
steel also makes efforts to settle appropriate cases  especially mesothelioma cases  for reasonable  and frequently nominal  amounts 
the following table shows activity with respect to asbestos litigation year ended december  opening number of claims claims dismissed  settled and resolved new claims closing number of claims amounts paid to resolve claims in millions the amount u 
s 
steel has accrued for pending asbestos claims is not material to u 
s 
steel s financial position 
u 
s 
steel does not accrue for unasserted asbestos claims because it is not possible to determine whether any loss is probable with respect to such claims or even to estimate the amount or range of any possible losses 
the vast majority of pending claims against us allege so called premises liability based exposure on u 
s 
steel s current or former premises 
these claims are made by an indeterminable number of people such as truck drivers  railroad workers  salespersons  contractors and their employees  government inspectors  customers  visitors and even trespassers 
in most cases  the claimant also was exposed to asbestos in non u 
s 
steel settings  the relative periods of exposure between u 
s 
steel and non u 
s 
steel settings vary with each claimant  and the strength or weakness of the causal link between u 
s 
steel exposure and any injury vary widely 
it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation 
despite this uncertainty  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  although the resolution of such matters could significantly impact results of operations for a particular quarter 
among the factors considered in reaching this conclusion are that over the last several years  the total number of pending claims has declined  that it has been many years since u 
s 
steel employed maritime workers or manufactured or sold asbestos containing products  and u 
s 
steel s history of trial outcomes  settlements and dismissals 
the foregoing statements of belief are forward looking statements 
predictions as to the outcome of pending litigation are subject to substantial uncertainties with respect to among other things factual and judicial determinations  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements 
environmental proceedings the following is a summary of the proceedings of u 
s 
steel that were pending or contemplated as of december   under federal and state environmental laws 
except as described herein  it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate outcome of these matters 
cercla remediation sites claims under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and related state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites 
cercla is intended to expedite the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault 
potentially responsible parties prps for each site include present and former owners and operators of  transporters to and generators of the substances at the site 
liability is strict and can be joint and several 
because of various factors including the ambiguity of the regulations  the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site  the complexity of determining the relative liability among them  the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred  it is impossible to reasonably estimate u 
s 
steel s ultimate cost of compliance with cercla 
projections  provided in the following paragraphs  of spending for and or timing of completion of specific projects are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions including  
table of contents but not limited to  the factors provided in the preceding paragraph 
to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  future spending for  or timing of completion of  environmental projects may differ materially from what was stated in forward looking statements 
at december   u 
s 
steel had been identified as a prp at a total of cercla sites where liability is not resolved 
based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  management believes that u 
s 
steel s liability for cleanup and remediation costs will be between million and million for two of these sites  will be between  and million per site for seven of these sites  and will be under  per site for of these sites 
at the remaining two sites  management estimates u 
s 
steel s share in the future cleanup costs to be million  although it is not possible to accurately predict the amount of final allocation of such costs 
one site is known as the municipal industrial disposal co 
site in elizabeth  pennsylvania 
in october  the pennsylvania department of environmental resources placed the site on the pennsylvania state superfund list and began a remedial investigation  which was issued in u 
s 
steel and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep signed a consent order and agreement on august   under which u 
s 
steel is responsible for remediation of this site 
in the consent order and agreement became final 
u 
s 
steel has completed the remedial design for this site and it is being reviewed by padep 
the other site is the former duluth works  which was listed by the minnesota pollution control agency mpca under the minnesota environmental response and liability act on its permanent list of priorities 
the us environmental protection agency epa has included the duluth works site with the st 
louis river interlake duluth tar site on epa s national priorities list 
the duluth works cleanup has proceeded since u 
s 
steel has prepared a conceptual habitat enhancement plan hep that includes measures to address contaminated sediments in the st 
louis river estuary 
mpca on behalf of epa has completed its second five year review for the site 
as a result  additional data collection will be required to address data gaps identified in the five year review and corrective measures will be required to address the recently discovered areas of contamination on the upland property 
study  investigation and oversight costs along with implementation of corrective measures on the upland property and implementation of the hep are currently estimated at million 
in addition  there are sites related to u 
s 
steel where information requests have been received or there are other indications that u 
s 
steel may be a prp under cercla  but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability or to make any judgment as to the amount thereof 
other remediation activities there are additional sites where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes  both federal and state  or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation 
based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  management believes that liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with of these sites will be under  per site  another sites have potential costs between  and million per site  and sites may involve remediation costs between million and million per site 
as described below  costs for remediation  investigation  restoration or compensation are estimated to be in excess of million per site at two sites and in excess of million per site at two sites 
potential costs associated with remediation at the remaining three sites are not presently determinable 
gary works on january   pursuant to an action filed by epa in the united states district court for the northern district of indiana titled united states of america v

overview u 
s 
steel  the eighth largest steel producer in the world and the largest integrated steel producer headquartered in north america  has a broad and diverse mix of products and customers 
u 
s 
steel uses iron ore  coal  coke  steel scrap  zinc  tin and other metallic additions to produce a wide range of steel products  concentrating on value added steel products for customers with demanding technical applications in the automotive  appliance  container  industrial machinery  construction and oil  gas and petrochemical industries 
in addition to our facilities in the united states  u

steel has significant operations in canada through u 
s 
steel canada inc ussc and in europe through u 
s 
steel ko ice ussk  located in slovakia  and u 
s 
steel serbia usss  located in serbia 
u 
s 
steel s financial results are primarily determined by the combined effects of shipment volume  selling prices  production costs and product mix 
while the operating results of our various businesses are affected by a number of business specific factors see item business steel industry background and competition  the primary drivers for u 
s 
steel are general economic conditions in north america  europe and  to a lesser extent  other steel consuming regions  the levels of worldwide steel production and consumption  pension and other benefits costs  and raw material iron ore  coal  coke  steel scrap  zinc  tin and other metallic additions and energy natural gas and electricity costs 
the difficult global economic environment is having significant negative effects on our business 
our raw steel capability utilization  which has averaged between and percent during the years  averaged only percent in the fourth quarter of we have reduced production levels to correspond with customer order rates by temporarily idling certain facilities and cutting back production at others 
we also have significantly reduced planned capital expenditures  reduced our inventory levels  placed a temporary freeze on salaries and hiring  offered a voluntary early retirement program verp which has been accepted by approximately non represented headquarters and operations employees in the united states  suspended the company match on employee k contributions  suspended our common stock buyback program and discontinued all non essential spending for travel and entertainment and outside services in an effort to maximize liquidity and lower costs 
u 
s 
steel cannot predict the trajectory or duration of the global recession 
lead times for steel orders are shorter now than they have been in the past  making it more difficult than usual to forecast the future 
if the situation grows worse  we may be forced to further curtail production including idling additional facilities  laying off employees and further deferring capital and other projects 
published indices report that a number of our major customer groups have significantly reduced their inventory levels leading us to believe that an upturn in general economic levels will translate into increased orders for steel products 
this is a forward looking belief that may be impacted by many factors beyond our control 
an increase in orders will likely require an increased investment in working capital  the cost of which will depend upon conditions in the financial markets see liquidity 
u 
s 
steel s long term success depends on our ability to earn a competitive return on capital employed by implementing our strategy to be a world leader in safety and environmental performance  to continue to increase 
table of contents our value added product mix  to further expand our global business platform  to maintain a strong capital structure  balance sheet and liquidity position  to continue to improve our reliability and cost competitiveness  and to attract and retain a diverse and talented workforce

some of the other key issues which are impacting the global steel industry  including u 
s 
steel  are the level of unfunded pension and other benefits obligations  the degree of industry consolidation  the impact of production and consumption of steel in china and other developing countries  and the levels of steel imports into the markets we serve 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of u 
s 
steel s financial condition and results of operations is based upon u 
s 
steel s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the year 
management regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to employee benefits liabilities and assets held in trust relating to such liabilities  the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities for deferred income taxes  potential tax deficiencies  environmental obligations and potential litigation claims and settlements 
management s estimates are based on historical experience  current business and market conditions  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from current expectations under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
pensions and other benefits the recording of net periodic benefit costs for defined benefit pensions and other benefits is based on  among other things  assumptions of the expected annual return on plan assets  discount rate  escalation or other changes in retiree health care costs and plan participation levels 
changes in the assumptions or differences between actual and expected changes in the present value of liabilities or assets of u 
s 
steel s plans could cause net periodic benefit costs to increase or decrease materially from year to year as discussed below 
u 
s 
steel s investment strategy for its domestic pension and retiree medical trusts provides that at least half of plan assets are invested in common stock with the balance primarily invested in bonds and other fixed income securities 
u 
s 
steel believes that returns on common stock over the long term will be higher than returns from fixed income securities as actual historical returns from u 
s 
steel s trusts have shown 
returns on bonds and other fixed income securities tend to offset some of the shorter term volatility of common stocks 
both equity and fixed income investments are made across a broad range of industries and companies to provide protection against the impact of volatility in any single industry as well as company specific developments 
u 
s 
steel is currently using an percent assumed rate of return for purposes of the expected return on assets for the development of net periodic cost for the main defined benefit pension plan and other benefits 
this rate was chosen by taking into account the intended asset mix and the historical premiums that fixed income and equity investments have yielded above government bonds 
actual returns since the inception of the plans have exceeded this percent rate and while recent returns have not  it is u 
s 
steel s expectation that future periods will return to this level 
for ussc defined benefit pension plans  a percent rate of return is being used for the development of net periodic costs in this rate was based on an investment strategy that provides that at least half of plan assets be invested in equity securities and the historical premiums that fixed income and equity investments have yielded above government bonds 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension and other benefits liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in setting the domestic rates  we utilize several aaa and aa corporate bond indices as an indication of interest rate movements and levels  and we also look to an internally calculated rate determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of aa or higher rated zero 
table of contents coupon corporate bonds theoretically available in the marketplace 
based on this evaluation at december   u 
s 
steel increased the discount rate used to measure both domestic pension and other benefits obligations to percent 
for ussc benefit plans  a discount rate was selected through a similar review process using canadian bond rates and indices and at december   u 
s 
steel increased the discount rate to percent for its canadian based pension and other benefits 
u 
s 
steel determines the escalation trend in per capita health care costs based on historical rate experience under u 
s 
steel s insurance plans 
much of our costs for the domestic usw participants retiree health benefits other than for most surviving spouses in the company s main domestic insurance plan are subject to a cost cap that was negotiated in as a result of the collective bargaining agreements with the united steelworkers usw entered into effective september  the cbas see note to the financial statements  our costs are subject to the full impact of escalation for the surviving spouse beneficiaries since their retiree premium contributions are now a flat fixed amount 
escalation applies to most other groups within the company s insurance plans  but does not apply to most domestic non union retirees since their benefits are limited to flat dollar amounts 
for measurement of its domestic retiree medical plans  u 
s 
steel has assumed an initial escalation rate of percent for this rate is assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of percent in and remain at that level thereafter 
in our canadian retiree medical plans  liabilities decreased as a result of lower escalation impacts due to favorable claims cost rate experience and exchange rate changes 
for measurement of its canadian retiree medical plans  u 
s 
steel has assumed an initial escalation rate of percent for this rate is assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of percent in and remain at that level thereafter 
net periodic pension cost  including multiemployer plans  is expected to total approximately million in compared to million in pension expense for includes an estimated million curtailment charge 
total other benefits costs in are expected to be approximately million  compared to million in the increases are due primarily to asset performance 
a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical percentage point change in the significant assumptions used in the pension and other benefits calculations is provided in the following table hypothetical rate increase decrease in millions of dollars expected return on plan assets incremental increase decrease in net periodic pension costs for discount rate incremental increase decrease in net periodic pension other benefits costs for pension other benefits liabilities at december  health care cost escalation trend rates incremental increase decrease in service and interest cost components for changes in the assumptions for expected annual return on plan assets and the discount rate do not impact the funding calculations used to derive minimum funding requirements for the pension plans

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of acquired identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed from businesses acquired 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the third quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the change in business conditions in the fourth quarter of was considered a triggering event as defined by fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  and goodwill was subsequently re tested for impairment as of december  the evaluation of impairment involves comparing 
table of contents the fair value of the associated reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
u 
s 
steel s reporting units are generally consistent with our reportable operating segments  except for our tubular segment 
within the tubular segment we have three reporting units corresponding to our different manufacturing processes and products 
fair value for each reporting unit with goodwill was estimated using discounted future cash flows based on management s long range estimates of market conditions over a five year horizon with a percent compound annual growth rate 
u 
s 
steel s risk free interest rate is approximately two percent and our systematic risk premium is approximately nine percent 
our testing did not indicate that goodwill was impaired as of december  however  if our future cash flow projections are not realized  either because of an extended recessionary period or other unforeseen events  goodwill may be subject to impairment in future periods 
a five percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units may result in an impairment 
u 
s 
steel has determined that certain acquired intangible assets have indefinite useful lives 
these assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the impairment test performed as of december  for property  plant and equipment  as described below  also addressed intangible assets with finite lives 
none of the long lived asset groupings with intangible assets were impaired as of december  asset impairments u 
s 
steel evaluates impairment of its property  plant and equipment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the change in business conditions in the fourth quarter of was considered a triggering event as defined by financial accounting standard fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and subsequently long lived asset groupings were tested for impairment 
our asset groupings are the same as our reporting units 
asset impairments are recognized when the carrying value of an asset grouping exceeds its aggregate projected undiscounted cash flows 
undiscounted cash flows for each asset grouping were estimated using management s long range estimates of market conditions associated with each asset grouping over the estimated useful life of the principal asset within the group 
our testing did not indicate that any of our long lived asset groupings were impaired as of december  however  if our future cash flow projections are not realized  either because of an extended recessionary period or other unforeseen events  impairment charges may be required in future periods 
a percent decrease in the projected cash flows of our asset groupings would not result in an impairment

steel determines that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should u 
s 
steel determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
u 
s 
steel expects to generate future taxable income to realize the benefits of our net deferred tax assets 
u 
s 
steel makes no provision for deferred us income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings because as of december   it remained management s intention to continue indefinitely to reinvest such earnings in foreign operations 
see note to the financial statements 
undistributed foreign earnings at december  amounted to approximately  million 
if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested  a us deferred tax liability of approximately million would have been required 
u 
s 
steel records liabilities for potential tax deficiencies 
these liabilities are based on management s judgment of the risk of loss for items that have been or may be challenged by taxing authorities 
in the event that u 
s 
steel were to determine that tax related items would not be considered deficiencies or that items previously not considered to be potential deficiencies could be considered potential tax deficiencies as a result of an audit  court case  tax ruling or other authoritative tax position  an adjustment to the liability would be recorded through income in the period such determination was made 
environmental remediation u 
s 
steel provides for remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable 
remediation liabilities are 
table of contents accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures and are discounted in certain instances 
u 
s 
steel regularly monitors the progress of environmental remediation 
should studies indicate that the cost of remediation is to be more than previously estimated  an additional accrual would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made 
as of december   the total accrual for environmental remediation was million  excluding liabilities related to asset retirement obligations under fas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
due to uncertainties inherent in remediation projects  it is possible that total remediation costs for active matters may exceed the accrued liability by as much as to percent

net foreign deferred tax assets will fluctuate as the value of the us dollar changes with respect to the euro  the canadian dollar and the serbian dinar 
a full valuation allowance is provided for serbian deferred tax assets because investment tax credits projected for future years  which must be used before investment credit carryovers  are expected to be more than sufficient to offset future tax liabilities 
a full valuation allowance is recorded for canadian deferred tax assets due to the absence of positive evidence at ussc to support the realizability of the assets

steel s current report on form k filed on december  the proceeds of the offering were used to repay the one year term loan and for general corporate purposes 
we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants at december  as previously discussed  our credit facility and term loan agreements contain financial covenants and other conditions to borrowing and re borrowing 
the current global recession may affect our ability to comply with those covenants and conditions due to its impact on our earnings and cash flow  and may affect the lenders ability to make loans under the credit facility or the availability of funds under the rpa 
such circumstances could trigger a need to modify or replace those agreements on less favorable terms that could adversely affect our flexibility  cash flow and profitability 
if we would be unable to so modify or replace those agreements  our term loans  which had outstanding balances totaling million as of december   could become immediately due and we could lose access to funds available under the credit facility and the rpa 
we use surety bonds  trusts and letters of credit to provide financial assurance for certain transactions and business activities

steel accrues an annual cost for retiree medical and retiree life benefit obligations under plans covering our active and retiree populations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these obligations will require corporate cash in future years to the extent that trust assets are restricted or insufficient and to the extent that company contributions are required by law or union labor agreements 
amounts in the years through reflect our current estimate of corporate cash outflows and are net of the projected use of funds available from asset trusts 
the accuracy of this forecast of future cash flows depends on various factors such as actual asset returns  the mix of assets within the asset trusts  medical escalation and discount rates used to calculate obligations  the availability of surplus pension assets allowable for transfer to pay retiree medical claims and company decisions or restrictions related to our trusts for retiree healthcare and life insurance that impact the timing of the use of trust assets

the current recession has restricted our visibility even in the near term and has limited our ability to predict our cash needs with any degree of certainty 
our major cash requirements in are expected to be for capital expenditures  employee benefits and working capital requirements 
we finished with million of available cash and received approximately million after taxes from the completion of the sale of the majority of the operating assets of ej e on january  when business conditions begin to improve  our working capital requirements will likely increase and we may need to draw upon our credit facilities for necessary cash 
funding under the rpa is based on a pool of eligible receivables that has declined as a result of lower orders 
a sudden increase in orders could require a significant amount of investment in working capital 
should we experience a significant increase in orders or an unexpected need for funds that cannot be met with available cash and our liquidity facilities  we may need to access the capital markets 
given the current economic environment  it is unclear on what terms if any we could access the capital markets 
over the longer term  we have significant future debt maturities see note to the financial statements and other obligations 
given the uncertainty regarding the duration of the global recession and the current turmoil in the financial markets  it is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty how much cash we will be able to generate  or the availability and terms of new borrowings  to meet our long term obligations 
our opinion regarding liquidity is a forward looking statement based upon currently available information 
to the extent that operating cash flow is materially lower than recent levels or external financing sources are not available on terms competitive with those currently available  future liquidity may be adversely affected

environmental matters  litigation and contingencies u 
s 
steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations 
in recent years  these expenditures have been mainly for process changes in order to meet clean air act obligations and similar obligations in europe and canada  although ongoing compliance costs have also been significant 
to the extent that these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services  operating results will be reduced 
u 
s 
steel believes that our major north american  and many european  integrated steel competitors are confronted by substantially similar conditions and thus does not believe that our relative position with regard to 
table of contents such competitors is materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations 
however  the costs and operating restrictions necessary for compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our competitive position with regard to domestic mini mills  some foreign steel producers particularly in developing economies such as china and producers of materials which compete with steel  all of which may not be required to incur equivalent costs in their operations 
in addition  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods 
u 
s 
steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to our prior disposal of environmentally sensitive materials 
many of our competitors do not have similar historical liabilities 
our us facilities are subject to the us environmental standards  including the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as well as state and local laws and regulations 
ussc is subject to the environmental laws of canada  which are comparable to environmental standards in the united states 
environmental regulation in canada is an area of shared responsibility between the federal government and the provincial governments  which in turn delegate certain matters to municipal governments 
federal environmental statutes include the federal canadian environmental protection act  and the fisheries act 
various provincial statutes regulate environmental matters such as the release and remediation of hazardous substances  waste storage  treatment and disposal  and air emissions 
as in the united states  canadian environmental laws federal  provincial and local are undergoing revision and becoming more stringent 
an opening balance sheet liability of approximately c million approximately million has been established to cover ussc s share of a sediment remediation project in hamilton harbor known as randle reef

the federal government has committed c million approximately million and the provincial government has committed another c million 
ussk is subject to the environmental laws of slovakia and the european union eu 
a related law of the eu commonly known as reach registration  evaluation  authorisation and restriction of chemicals  regulation requires the registration of certain substances that are produced in the eu or imported into the eu 
ussk pre registered various substances during the six month pre registration period that ended november   both on its own behalf and on behalf of u 
s 
steel and certain of its subsidiaries that may be shipping products into the eu 
ussk is compliant with reach and intends to register its substances by the applicable deadlines to remain in compliance and be able to continue its businesses without material change 
usss is subject to the environmental laws of serbia 
under the terms of the acquisition in  usss is responsible for only those costs and liabilities associated with environmental events occurring subsequent to the completion of an environmental baseline study in june  which was submitted to the government of serbia 
in january  usss entered into an agreement with the serbian government that commits us to spend approximately million before the end of to improve the environmental performance of our facilities 
spending for this commitment in was million 
the spending is focused on projects aimed at reducing air particulate emissions 
many nations  including the united states  are considering regulation of carbon dioxide co emissions 
international negotiations to supplement or replace the kyoto protocol are ongoing 
the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create co emissions 
this distinguishes integrated steel producers from mini mills and many other industries where co generation is generally linked to energy usage 
the eu has established greenhouse gas regulations  canada has published details of a regulatory framework for greenhouse gas emissions  and in the united states  the new administration has announced its commitment to implement a national cap and trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by percent by such regulations may entail substantial capital expenditures  restrict production  and raise the price of coal  coke and other carbon based energy sources

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments u

steel uses commodity based and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage our market and exchange rate risk 
management has authorized the use of futures  forwards  swaps and options to manage exposure to price fluctuations related to the purchase of natural gas and nonferrous metals  and also certain business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
historically  the forward physical purchase contracts for natural gas and nonferrous metals have qualified for the normal purchases and normal sales exemption under 
table of contents fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and have therefore not required derivative accounting 
due to the idling of certain facilities in december  some of these contracts no longer meet the exemption criteria and are therefore being marked to market 
as of december   u 
s 
steel held commodity contracts for natural gas with a total notional value of approximately million that qualified as derivatives 
u 
s 
steel also held commodity contracts for natural gas that qualified for the normal purchases and normal sales exemption with a total notional value of approximately million at december  this represents approximately percent of our north american natural gas needs 
the fair value of our natural gas derivatives is determined using level inputs 
the inputs used include forward prices derived from the new york mercantile exchange 
foreign currency derivative instruments have been marked to market and the resulting gains or losses recognized in the current period in net interest and other financial costs 
for future periods  u 
s 
steel may elect to use hedge accounting for certain transactions  primarily related to forecasted natural gas purchases 
for those transactions  the impact of the effective portion of the hedging instrument will be recognized in other comprehensive income until the natural gas purchase is settled 
once the purchase is settled  the effect of the hedged item will be recognized in income 
while u 
s 
steel s risk management activities generally reduce market risk exposure due to unfavorable commodity price changes for raw material purchases and products sold  such activities can also encompass strategies that assume price risk 
management believes that the use of derivative instruments  along with risk assessment procedures and internal controls  does not expose u 
s 
steel to material risk 
the use of derivative instruments could materially affect u
