recent developments for the company overview we supply technology based products based upon portable digital video and audio recording capabilities  primarily for the law enforcement and security industries 
we have the ability to integrate electronic  radio  computer  mechanical  and multi media technologies to create unique solutions to customers requests 
since our inception in through the second quarter of  we had been considered a development stage company  with our activities focused on organizational activities  including design and development of product lines  implementing a business plan  establishing sales channels  and development of business strategies 
in late march  we sold and shipped our first completed product  thereby becoming an operating company 
we have experienced significant growth in revenues  whereby our revenues have increased from million in to million in we have active research and development projects that we anticipate will result in several new products being launched during and beyond 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have material current or future effect on financial conditions  changes in the financial conditions  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  capital resources  or significant components of revenue or expenses 
we are a party to operating leases and license agreements that represent commitments for future payments described in note to the financial statements 
in addition  we have issued purchase orders in the ordinary course of business that represent commitments to future payments for goods and services 
for the years ended december  and results of operations summarized immediately below and discussed in more detail in the subsequent sub sections is an analysis of our operating results for the years ended december  and represented as a percentage of total revenues for each respective year revenue cost of sales gross profit operating expenses operating income other income expense income before income tax provision benefit income tax provision benefit net income net income per share information basic diluted revenues we commenced delivery and sale of our digital video rear view mirror dvm product in march and have enjoyed revenue growth in every year since our initial deliveries 
we have customers in all states and our largest single order to date in the amount of million was placed by an international customer 
we believe our dvm product has achieved widespread acceptance in the marketplace 
in addition  we intend to expand our product line significantly in  which we anticipate will contribute to increasing our revenues 
these new product offerings include new products for end users other than law enforcement  as well as product upgrades and new product offerings for law enforcement uses 
sales for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  an increase of   due to increased market penetration 
we expect that the current economic downturn in the overall economy will have some effect on certain state and local tax bases that will negatively affect our business for however  we expect that any increase in federal funding to states and municipalities generated from the stimulus bill recently enacted by the federal government may partially  if not totally  offset the impact of lower state and local tax collections 
our international revenues were  or of total revenues during and  or of revenues 
we believe that our product is particularly well suited for international customers because of the ease of installation  price  and our two year warranty  the simple operation of our equipment and the universal nature of rear view mirrors 
for these reasons  we believe our international business will grow in terms of total revenue and as a percent of total revenue during  which may partially offset the weakness in our domestic revenues 
we have maintained consistent retail pricing on our digital video rear view mirror system during and do not plan any increases in the pricing during for the legacy dvm system 
our new products include an upgrade to the dvm model  which will be sold at higher retail pricing levels during due to increased features 
however  international sales are typically priced at discounted rates because we are not required to provide certain follow on technical support and we incur reduced sales commissions on such sales 
cost of sales cost of sales on units sold for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  an increase of  
the significant increase is due to the increase in units sold  as well as a  increase in the reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory during we believe these reserves are appropriate given the increased inventory levels we have at december  compared to and the new product introductions we anticipate during our new product offerings during will likely increase our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales due to costs and inefficiencies related to advancing engineering prototypes to commercial production 
we do not expect significant capital expenditures to ramp up production of the new products since our internal process is largely assembling subcomponents  testing and shipping of completed products 
we rely on our subcontractors to produce finished circuit boards that represent the primary component in our product  thereby reducing our need to purchase capital equipment 
however  we will need to acquire test and calibration equipment to ensure the completed product meets our specifications and requirements 
we primarily order finished component parts  including electronics boards  chips and camera parts  from outside suppliers 
our internal work consists of assembly  testing and burn in of the finished units 
we have added indirect production and purchasing personnel to help manage and to gain efficiencies in our production process as we continue to significantly increase our production rates and expand our product line during and beyond 
we have hired a new purchasing manager in order to concentrate on improving our raw material and component costs by managing our supply chain better through quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices 
we believe that with an increased production rate and expanded product lines in  we will be able to reduce our component and supply chain costs by ordering in larger quantities 
in addition  we believe that increased production rates in will stimulate further efficiencies in our assembly  testing and burn in process that will lead to cost of sales improvements 
however we expect these supply chain efficiencies will be less than the impact from the introduction of new products on our cost of sales during resulting in an overall increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales 
gross margin gross margin for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  an increase of  
the significant increase is commensurate with the growth in revenues we experienced during the gross margin percentages remained relatively steady at and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our margins are expected to be lower than normal on revenues contributed by our new products as we bring these products into commercial production during however  as revenues increase from these products  we will seek to improve our margins from these new products somewhat from economies of scale and more effectively utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components 
we plan to concentrate on managing our supply chain better through quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices 
however  on an overall basis we expect a slight decline in our gross margin percentage in due primarily to the impact of our new product offerings 
operating expenses operating expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  
overall operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined to in compared to in a summary of the significant components of operating expenses are as follows year ended december  research and development expenses stock based compensation sales commissions professional fees and expenses selling  general and administrative salaries other total research and development expenses 
we continue to focus on bringing new products and updates and revisions to current products to market with these expenses totaling  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  
the increase in was attributable to our continued efforts to develop new products and line extensions for our current products that we plan to bring to market during  as well as additional internal staff additions related to the same activities 
we employed a total of engineers at december  as compared to at december   most of which are dedicated to research and development activities for new products 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in and in  illustrating our commitment to bringing new products to market and expanding our current product line 
we have active research and development projects on several new products designed for the motorcycle  school bus  mass transit  taxi cab and other markets  as well as upgrades to our existing product lines 
in addition  we have been and are currently attempting to hire additional engineers to focus on these development projects 
therefore  we believe that such expense will continue to increase during  although we expect that such expense as a percentage of total revenues will likely remain steady or decline as our revenues increase 
we consider our research and development capabilities and new product focus to be a competitive advantage and will continue to invest in this area 
stock based compensation expenses 
stock based compensation expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  
the decrease in was primarily attributable to the longer vesting periods associated with the stock option and restricted stock plan the plan offset by the higher number of options issued in  which had shorter vesting periods 
on january   our board of directors approved the plan  which reserved  shares to be granted under it 
in addition  the board of directors approved the grant of options to purchase  shares to executive officers and directors at an exercise price of per share  subject to a graduated  four year vesting period and to approval of the plan by the shareholders 
the plan was approved by the shareholders at the annual meeting of stockholders  which was held on may   at which time the option value was determined and the amortization of the option value expense commenced 
in addition   options were granted during november  subject to a one year vesting period 
we expect that total stock compensation expense for will continue to decline compared to levels 
sales commissions 
sales commissions totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  
the increase in was commensurate with the increase in revenue experienced during the years ended december  compared to sales commissions as a percentage of total revenues were during the year ended december   a slight increase from the experienced in the increased percentage is attributable to a change involving our largest individual customer during the third quarter of  whereby this international customer commenced buying direct from the company rather than through our international distributor 
in order to effect this change  we began paying commissions on such sales 
professional fees and expenses 
professional fees and expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  
professional fees and expenses  which primarily include legal and accounting expenses  increased because of our increased reporting and other requirements after becoming an sec reporting company in may in addition  we incurred substantial legal expenses related to the l communications mobile vision  inc and dehuff litigation during which did not occur in the l communications mobile vision  inc litigation has been settled  however  the dehuff litigation is still pending 
we also incurred higher accounting and auditing fees during now that we are required to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act that we were not subject to previously 
selling  general and administrative salaries 
general and administrative salaries totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  
the increase in was commensurate with the increase in revenue experienced during the year ended december  compared to we have added administrative personnel during early in order to build the infrastructure required for our current and planned growth in and beyond 
effective january  we have hired three new sales employees  including an international sales manager  an inside sales manager and a national accounts manager  to improve our sales and marketing infrastructure in anticipation of the new products being launched in and to increase our presence internationally 
general and administrative salaries as a percentage of total revenues increased slightly to during the year ended december  compared to during other operating expenses 
other operating expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  
the increase in was commensurate with the increase in revenue experienced during the year ended december  compared to in order to support our significant increase in revenue  we incurred greater facility related expenses  depreciation  general and administrative  and travel during during late  we combined our corporate offices with our sales and marketing offices into one facility 
the company has incurred increased travel costs for our executives to attend investor conferences and meet with potential institutional investors to expand our base of shareholders during the year ended december   which did not occur in other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues were during the year ended december  compared to during operating income for the reasons previously stated  our operating income was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an improvement of  
operating income as a percentage of revenues improved to in as compared to in we believe such positive trends in operating income will continue in as our revenue and gross margins dollars increase and management s continued monitoring and control over selling general and administrative expenses 
other income expense other income expense improved to  in from  in other income expense is primarily composed of interest income and expense 
changes in these items are described as follows interest income 
we earned interest income of  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  
the increase in interest income was a result of our increased average cash balances during compared to interest expense 
interest expense was and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  
with improved cash flow from business growth  we paid off our line of credit during early and the holder of a  convertible promissory note exercised his right to exchange such promissory note for  shares of common stock during may we have had no interest bearing debt outstanding since may income before income tax provision benefit as a result of the above  we reported income before income tax provision benefit of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an improvement of  income tax provision benefit our income tax provision was  for the year ended december  as compared to an income tax benefit was  for the year ended december  we reduced the deferred tax valuation allowance by  due to the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards in the year ended december   the anticipated usage of the remaining net operating loss carryforward based upon our projected profitability and the reversal of other deferred tax assets 
prior to  management recorded a valuation allowance offsetting this tax benefit from prior net operating loss carryforwards and timing differences due to uncertainty regarding our likelihood of realizing a material portion of the benefit 
during the year ended december   we recorded a provision for income taxes at an effective tax rate of 
the majority of our tax provision for was offset by the company s net operating loss carryforwards and by tax deductions related to the exercise of stock purchase options and warrants during and therefore did not require cash payments to taxing authorities 
during  the company realized an aggregate tax deduction approximating  relative to the exercise of such stock options and warrants which generated excess tax benefits of  that has been allocated directly to additional paid in capital during the years ended december  net income as a result of the above  for the years ended december  and  we reported net income of  and  respectively  a decrease of  the primary reason for the decrease is the one time income tax benefit of  recorded in basic and diluted income per share the basic income per share was and for the years ended december  and  respectively  for the reasons previously noted 
the diluted income per share was and  respectively  for the same periods 
the difference between basic and dilutive income per share is attributable to the dilutive effect of shares issuable under stock options and warrants 
liquidity and capital resources overall during and  we funded our operations internally through operations and the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits 
prior to and  we provided for our cash requirements through private placements of our common stock 
in  we raised a net of million from the sale of our common stock and  during the third quarter of  we completed a private placement of our common stock and common stock purchase warrants  which raised a net of million 
during march  we began shipment of our products and commenced the generation of revenues and operating cash flows to help support our activities 
during the fourth quarter of  we established a  revolving line of credit with a bank  which we utilized to support our activities 
in april  we paid off the line of credit in full  and the bank expanded the line of credit to million 
the holder of a  note payable exercised its right to convert the note to  shares of common stock  which was completed during the second quarter of during february  our bank renewed our operating line of credit through february and expanded the borrowing capacity to million 
as of december   we had working capital of  and we had no long term or short term interest bearing debt outstanding 
we have not had any interest bearing debt outstanding since may cash and cash equivalents balances as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents with an aggregate balance of  down from a balance of  at december  summarized immediately below and discussed in more detail in the subsequent sub sections are the main elements of the  net decrease in cash during the year ended december  operating activities  of net cash used in operating activities  primarily from a substantial increase in accounts receivable and inventory balances partially offset by cash provided by net income adjusted for non cash charges  such as stock based compensation expense and non cash credits  such as deferred income tax benefits and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
investing activities  of net cash used in investing activities  primarily to acquire equipment to expand our research  development and production capabilities and the purchase of technology licenses utilized in our products 
financing activities  of net cash provided by financing activities  representing the proceeds from stock option and warrants exercised and the related excess tax benefit offset by the purchase of common shares for treasury 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the negative cash flow from operations for the year ended december  is primarily the result of a substantial increase in trade accounts receivable  and inventory  during accounts receivable balances increased because of two individual accounts totaling  which were not collected until after december  excluding these two large receivables  our average days sales outstanding was days at december  the build up in inventory is attributable to a shortfall in our fourth quarter sales versus expectations that resulted in substantially higher levels of finished goods  totaling  at december  compared to  at december  in addition  our raw materials and component parts balance was approximately million  representing an increase of million from december   which is attributable to inventory acquired for the new products that will be introduced in and inventory acquired to meet sales forecasts for the fourth quarter of and first quarter offsetting the negative cash flows described above is our net income of  an increase in accounts payable  and accrued expenses  and non cash charges of  which were primarily related to stock based compensation  and depreciation and amortization investing activities cash used in investing activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in both and  we purchased production  research and development equipment and office furniture and fixtures to support our activities 
during  we acquired several licenses for technology utilized in our products and included in intangible assets 
financing activities during the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was  which is attributable to proceeds from the exercise of stock purchase options and warrants of  and the related excess tax benefit totaling  during  we purchased common shares for treasury in the amount of  we have not had any outstanding debt since may the net result of these activities was a decrease in cash of  to  for the year ended december  commitments we had  of cash and cash equivalent balances and net positive working capital approximating million as of december  accounts receivable balances represented  of our net working capital at december  we expect our outstanding receivables will be collected timely and the overall level to be reduced substantially during  which will provide positive cash flows to support our operations in inventory represents  of our net working capital at december  we are actively managing the overall level of inventory and expect that such levels will be reduced substantially during  which will provide cash flow to help support our operations in in addition  in february we renewed our revolving line of credit for an additional one year term until february and increased our maximum available borrowings to  the renewed line of credit bears variable interest at the bank s prime rate less  with a floor of 
we believe we have adequate cash balances and available borrowings under our line of credit to support our anticipated cash needs and related business activities during capital expenditures

litigation 
on april   thomas dehuff filed suit against the company and charles a 
ross in the chancery court of lincoln county  mississippi 
charles a 
ross  jr  ross is the son of charles a 
ross and was a former officer and director of the company 
the complaint alleges that on or about april   the plaintiff entered into a verbal agreement with ross  whom the plaintiff maintains was acting for and on behalf of the company  under which he purportedly was to receive  shares of the company s common stock to resolve certain claims to compensation the plaintiff maintains was due from the company 
the lawsuit also claims that the plaintiff advanced funds to ross  believing that he was purchasing the company common stock which was never issued 
plaintiff is seeking unspecified damages and punitive damages and attorney fees in addition to requiring the company to issue the common shares 
the company has successfully removed the case from the chancery court of lincoln county  mississippi to the united states district court located in jackson mississippi 
the company has filed a motion to dismiss the case which is currently pending in the united states district court 
the company believes that the lawsuit is without merit and will vigorously defend itself 
k plan 
in july  the company amended and restated its k retirement savings plan 
the amended plan requires the company to provide a matching contribution for employees who elect to contribute up to of their compensation to the plan and a matching contribution for employee s elective deferrals between and 
the company has made matching contributions totaling  for the year ended december  each participant is vested at all times in employee and employer matching contributions 
stock repurchase program 
during september  the board of directors approved the stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock in the open market  or in privately negotiated transactions  through july  the repurchases  if and when made  will be subject to market conditions  applicable rules of the sec and other factors 
purchases may be commenced  suspended or discontinued at any time 
a total of  shares have been repurchased under this program as of december  at a total cost of  per share average 
we used cash available to make such purchases 
in the future  we plan to use available cash and cash equivalent balances  together with cash generated by future operations  to fund any purchases of the shares 
management believes that the prudent repurchase of our common stock from time to time represents an efficient way to improve shareholder value as compared to the current interest earned on our cash balances and will not inhibit our ability to fund current and anticipated future product line expansions 
critical accounting estimates certain accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements require us to make judgments and estimates and the financial results we report may vary depending on how we make these judgments and estimates 
our critical accounting estimates are set forth below and have not changed during the year ended december  and revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts nature of estimates required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of uncollectible accounts receivable at the balance sheet date 
we monitor our credit exposure on a regular basis and assess the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate our required allowance for doubtful accounts using the following key assumptions historical collections represented as the amount of historical uncollectible accounts as a percent of total accounts receivable 
specific credit exposure on certain accounts identified based on management s review of the accounts receivable portfolio and taking into account the financial condition of customers that management may deem to be higher risk of collection 
sensitivity analysis 
prior to  we did not consider an allowance for doubtful accounts necessary 
however  with continued monitoring we determined the need to establish an allowance due to our rapid growth during and even though we do not anticipate bad debt losses based on our excellent customer payment history  we have established a reserve and will monitor it regularly 
inventories nature of estimates required 
in our third year of production  we have carried large quantities of component inventory in order to meet our customers demands 
this inventory consisted of electronic circuitry  boards and camera parts 
given the nature of potential obsolescence in this ever changing environment  there is a risk of impairment in inventory that is unsalable  non refundable  slow moving or obsolete 
the use of estimates is required in determining the salvage value of this inventory 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate our inventory obsolescence reserve at each balance sheet date based on the following assumptions slow moving products items identified as slow moving are evaluated on a case by case basis for impairment 
obsolete discontinued inventory products identified that are near or beyond their expiration  or new models are now available 
should this occur  we estimate the market value of this inventory as if it were to be liquidated 
estimated salvage value sales price salvage value is estimated using management s evaluation of remaining value of this inventory and the ability to liquidate this inventory 
sensitivity analysis 
at this point in our products early life cycles  coupled with prudent levels of purchasing activity to support the growing demands for our products  we have developed a methodology to determine slow moving or obsolete inventory 
we will continue to assess the condition of our inventory and take necessary measures to adjust these values as deemed appropriate 
warranties nature of estimate required 
in the third year of sales and as the volume of our sales continues to increase at a rapid pace  we have established a warranty accrual for future warranty costs related to current sales 
we monitor our warranty costs on a regular basis and assess the adequacy of our warranty accrued on a quarterly basis 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate our required accrual for warranty costs using the following key assumptions historical costs represented as the amount of historical warranty costs as a percent of sales 
specific exposure on certain products or customers identified by management s review of warranty costs and customer responses 
sensitivity analysis 
prior to  we did not consider the need for a warranty accrual based upon actual warranty costs due to the limited amount of sales 
as sales volume has continued to grow at a rapid pace during and  there is a greater risk for increased warranty costs 
we will continue to assess the warranty accrual on a quarterly basis and take the necessary measures to adjust the accrual as deemed appropriate 
research and development costs nature of estimates required 
we expense all research and development costs as incurred 
we incurred substantial costs related to research and development as we prepared our products for market  and will continue to incur these costs as we develop new products and enhance our existing products 
assumptions and approach used 
as we moved to production  many of these costs shifted to expenses related to the production of this product cost of sales  thus reducing our research and development expense 
however  we continue to provide support to the development of enhancements to our existing products  as well as to invest resources in the development of new products 
sensitivity analysis 
we continually evaluate our efforts in new product development so that we properly classify costs to either production of existing product or research and development costs related to bringing new and enhanced products to market 
stock based compensation nature of estimates required 
the estimates and assumptions pertaining to stock based compensation pertain to the black scholes valuation model and are noted above under critical accounting policies 
assumption and approach used 
for our stock option plans  the assumptions for term  volatility  interest rate and forfeitures have all been addressed specifically to the particulars of each option plan in calculating the associated expense 
the expected term of each plan has been projected based on the estimated term expected time to exercise said options in relation to the vesting period and expiration of the options 
the expected volatility of award grants is properly measured using historical stock prices over the expected term of the award 
the risk free interest rate used is in relation to the expected term of awards 
finally  forfeitures are based on the history of cancellation of awards granted 
sensitivity analysis 
we will continually monitor costs related to stock based compensation  and adjust analyses for changes in estimates and assumptions  such as shifts in expected term caused by shifts in the exercising of options  expected volatility shifts caused by changes in our historical stock prices  interest rate shifts in relation to expected term of awards  and  shifts in forfeitures as we experience potential cancellations of awards caused by loss of personnel holding such awards 
the common stock purchase warrants issued to investors in our private placement are not accounted for under sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity because the warrant agreements contain no provision for us to use any of our cash or other assets to settle the warrants 
the stock warrants are not considered derivatives under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
as the warrant agreements meet the scope exception in paragraph a of sfas no 
as the stock warrants are indexed to our common stock and are classified in stockholder s equity under emerging issues task force eitf accounting recognition for certain transactions involving equity instruments granted to other than employees 
the stock warrants are included with the proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
warrants issued to non employees who are not investors purchasing common stock are accounted for under sfas no 
the fair value is determined using the black scholes pricing model and that amount is recognized in the statement of operations 
income taxes nature of estimates required 
we have substantial net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax items for which deferred tax assets are recognized for financial accounting and reporting purposes 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management must consider the likelihood that such deferred tax assets will be realized based on our current and projected future operating results 
assumptions and approach used 
historically  management has provided a valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets because of our history of operating losses and unproven marketability and profitability of our products 
during  we began shipping products which has resulted in substantial revenue growth whereby we have generated significant taxable income in and management has evaluated the likelihood of our ability to realize our deferred tax assets through principally the current and anticipated generation of taxable income 
based on that evaluation  management has determined that the valuation allowance should be substantially reduced as of december  there was no change in the valuation allowance during sensitivity analysis 
management will continually monitor  evaluate and adjust our evaluation analyses of the likelihood of our ability to realize our deferred tax assets based upon projected future financial results 
this evaluation may require changes in the valuation allowance when and if conditions change that could affect our current and future operations 
inflation and seasonality inflation has not materially affected us during the past fiscal year 
our business is not seasonal in nature
