item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in part iv  item of this report and the risk factors section in item a  as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this report  before deciding to purchase  hold or sell our common stock 
overview we are a leader in the traffic management market focused on the development and application of advanced technologies that reduce traffic congestion and improve the safety of surface transportation systems infrastructure 
as an added benefit  our products and services minimize the environmental impact of traffic congestion 
by combining outdoor image processing  traffic engineering and information technology  we offer a broad range of its and driver safety solutions to customers worldwide 
we currently operate in three reportable segments roadway sensors  vehicle sensors  and transportation systems 
the roadway sensors segment includes our vantage and versicam vehicle detection systems for traffic intersection control  incident detection and certain highway traffic data collection applications 
the vehicle sensors segment includes our autovue ldw system and is comprised of all activities related to vehicle safety 
the transportation systems segment includes transportation engineering and consulting services  and the development of transportation management and traveler information systems for the its industry 
our roadway sensors segment product line uses advanced image processing technology to capture and analyze video images through sophisticated algorithms  enabling vehicle detection and transmission of both video images and data using a wide range of communication technologies 
our vantage video detection systems detect vehicle presence  count  speed  occupancy  and other traffic data used in traffic management systems 
this gives traffic managers the ability to mitigate roadway congestion by modifying traffic signal timing or detecting incidents quickly 
versicam  our integrated camera and processor video detection system  is a cost efficient video detection system for smaller intersections that require only a few detection points 
vantage video detection systems have been deployed by hundreds of agencies and are currently sold through a network of independent dealers in the united states  asia  latin america  europe and the middle east 
our vehicle sensors segment addresses the leading cause of roadway fatalities rear end  lane change  and roadway departure accidents 
according to the national highway traffic safety administration  these three crash types result in about  of the us s  annual traffic fatalities and contribute to a considerable economic loss due to injuries  property damage  and decreased productivity 
our vehicle sensors segment developed the world s first production ldw system and offers a proven system that is available as an oem and aftermarket option on heavy trucks worldwide and as an option in passenger cars 
our ldw products utilize video detection images to detect when a vehicle begins to drift toward an unintended lane change 
when this occurs  the unit automatically emits a distinctive rumble strip or other audible warning sound  alerting the driver to make a correction 
to date  we have sold approximately  ldw systems into the heavy truck market in europe  north america and asia 
our ldw systems are currently qualified as an option on certain heavy trucks  including mercedes benz  man  iveco  daf  scania  freightliner and fuso  as well as neoplan and man luxury bus and coach lines 
in north america  our ldw systems are sold primarily to truck fleets  and to date  us heavy truck fleets have selected our ldw systems  with a combined fleet size estimated at  vehicles 
additionally  we have licensed our ldw technology to our strategic partner  valeo  resulting in sales to date of approximately  ldw systems for passenger cars 
in addition to our ldw systems  we expanded our vehicle sensors portfolio in august with newly developed technologies such as radar based forward collision warning and blind spot warning systems for the north american truck market 
we also introduced safety direct in march  which is a system that reports real time driver performance data captured by our ldw system and that has the ability to relay this information directly to fleet operators through integration with the truck s existing fleet communications system 
we offer the fcw and bsw features through the resale of delphi s radar based systems  for which we are the exclusive north american dealer  while safety direct was internally developed 
these new products  together with our ldw products  combine to create a broad suite of active safety driver assistance features that help to reduce the number of motor vehicle crashes and the severity of crash related injuries 

table of contents our transportation systems segment includes transportation engineering and consulting services focused on the planning  design  development and implementation of software based systems that integrate sensors  video surveillance  computers  and advanced communications equipment to enable public agencies to monitor  control  and direct traffic flow  assist in the quick dispatch of emergency crews and distribute real time information about traffic conditions 
our services include planning  design  and implementation of surface transportation infrastructure systems 
we perform analysis and study goods movement  commercial vehicle operations  travel demand forecasting  and systems engineering  and identify mitigation measures to reduce traffic congestion 
these services and systems are primarily sold to local  state  and national transportation agencies in the united states 
our transportation systems segment is largely dependent upon governmental funding and budgetary issues 
the federal highway bill that was passed in august provided for a significant increase in transportation funding 
we believe the recent expansion of our transportation systems segment was due in part to the passage of the federal highway bill  combined with increased transportation funds available at state and local agencies throughout the country 
the federal highway bill is set to expire in september at this point in time  the impact on future contract revenues as a result of the recently introduced federal stimulus package and any potential delays in the passage of future transportation bills cannot be determined 
during fiscal  we introduced certain products including versicam  edgeconnect and safety direct 
we also completed the acquisition of certain assets of hamilton signal including the abacus system for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  this acquisition should afford us with the opportunity to provide our customers with traffic and incident detection data from our installed base of surveillance cameras 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements included herein  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable  the valuation of inventories  the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  the realizability of deferred tax assets  accounting for stock based compensation  the valuation of equity instruments  warranty reserves and other contingencies 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions by their nature involve risks and uncertainties  and may prove to be inaccurate 
in the event that any of our estimates or assumptions are inaccurate in any material respect  it could have a material adverse effect on our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record product revenues and related costs of sales upon transfer of title  which is generally upon shipment or  if required  upon acceptance by the customer  provided that we believe collectibility of the net sales amount is reasonably assured 
accordingly  at the date revenue is recognized  the significant uncertainties concerning the sale have been resolved 
contract revenues are derived primarily from long term contracts with governmental agencies 
contract revenues include costs incurred plus a portion of estimated fees or profits determined using the percentage of completion method of accounting based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to earnings when identified 
changes in job performance and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to recognized costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
profit incentives are included in revenue when their realization is reasonably assured 
in addition to product and contract revenues  we derive revenue from technology access fees  the provision of specific non recurring contract engineering services to our strategic partner  valeo  related to our ldw systems  and royalties earned on unit sales of our ldw systems by valeo to the passenger car market 
technology access fee revenues are recognized evenly over the period in which they are earned 
non recurring contract engineering revenues are recognized in the period in which the related services are performed 
royalty revenues are recorded based on unit sales of our products by valeo and are recognized in the period in which such sales occur 
technology access fee revenues  non recurring contract engineering revenues and royalty revenues are included in net sales 
revenues from follow on service and support  for which we generally charge separately  are recorded in the period in which the services are performed 
accounts receivable 
we estimate the collectibility of customer receivables on an ongoing basis by periodically reviewing invoices outstanding greater than a certain period of time 
we record reserves for receivables deemed to be at risk for collection as well as a general reserve based on our historical collections experience 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing 
table of contents the ultimate realization of trade receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
inventory 
inventories consist of finished goods  work in process and raw materials and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we provide reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventory 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
reserves are established for inventory levels that exceed anticipated future demand 
it is possible that reserves over and above those already established may be required in the future if market conditions for our products deteriorate 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter at the reporting unit level unless a change in circumstances indicates that more frequent impairment analysis is required 
impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the reporting units with the recorded goodwill 
fair value is determined by using the income approach methodology of valuation which utilizes discounted cash flows taking into consideration the market approach 
the estimated fair value of our reporting units also includes a control premium  which is the amount that a buyer is willing to pay over the current market price of a company as indicated by the traded price per share ie  market capitalization  in order to acquire a controlling interest 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use the financial assumptions in our current budget and our current strategic plan  subject to modification as considered necessary  including sales and expense growth rates and the discount rates we estimate to represent our cost of funds 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of goodwill  we could incur impairment charges 
warranty 
we generally provide a one to three year warranty from the original invoice date on all products  materials and workmanship 
defective products are either repaired or replaced  at our option  upon meeting certain criteria 
we accrue a provision for the estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties relating to a product as a component of cost of sales at the time revenue for that product is recognized 
the accrued warranty provision is included within accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
should our actual experience of warranty returns be higher than anticipated  additional warranty reserves may be required  which may adversely affect our operating results 
income taxes 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to amounts that we believe are more likely than not to be realized  which increases our income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our anticipated annual effective tax rate will be and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with this anticipated rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  we refine our estimates based upon actual events and earnings during the year 
this estimation process can result in significant changes to our expected effective tax rate 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision reflects the expected annual rate 
the changes described in the preceding sentence and adjustments to our valuation allowance may create fluctuations in our overall effective tax rate from quarter to quarter 
effective april   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which applies to all tax positions accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by establishing minimum standards for the recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under the requirements of fin  we must review all of our tax positions and make a determination as to whether our position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by regulatory authorities 
if a tax position meets the more likely than not standard  then the related tax benefit is measured based on a cumulative probability analysis of the amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement or disposition of the underlying issue 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
stock based compensation 
we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  effective april  sfas r requires all stock based payments  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations as an expense  based on their grant date fair values with such fair values amortized over the requisite service 
table of contents period 
we elected to utilize the modified prospective method for the transition to sfas r 
under the modified prospective method  sfas r applies to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption 
in addition  under the modified prospective method  compensation expense will be recognized for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of april   based on grant date fair values estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas in implementing sfas r  we have used the black scholes merton bsm option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of stock based awards granted subsequent to april  while this model meets the requirements of sfas r  the estimated fair values generated by it may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our stock based awards as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability 
our assumptions under the bsm formula include the following i expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our stock price  ii the expected life of options is derived based on the historical life of our options  iii the risk free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury interest rates in effect at the time of grant and iv the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
additionally  sfas did not require the estimation of forfeitures in the calculation of stock compensation expense  however  sfas r does require such estimation and upon adoption of sfas r  we changed our methodology to include an estimate of forfeitures 
future stock based compensation expense in any particular quarter or year could be affected by changes in our assumptions  changes in market conditions  or to the extent that we grant additional stock based awards 
additionally  if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested stock based awards  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data as a percentage of total net sales and contract revenues for the periods indicated 
the following table should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
year ended march  net sales and contract revenues net sales contract revenues total net sales and contract revenues costs of net sales and contract revenues cost of net sales cost of contract revenues gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses operating income non operating income expense other income expense  net interest expense  net income before income taxes income tax benefit net income analysis of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal results of operations net sales and contract revenues 
net sales are comprised of product sales from our roadway sensors and vehicle sensors segments  as well as technology access fees  contract engineering revenue and royalty revenue generated from our vehicle sensors segment 
contract revenues consist entirely of transportation systems contract revenues  which are generated from systems integration and its consulting services primarily with federal  state  county and municipal agencies 

table of contents the following tables present details of our net sales and contract revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal  respectively fiscal fiscal increase decrease change in thousands  except percentages roadway sensors vehicle sensors net sales contract revenues total net sales and contract revenues fiscal fiscal increase change in thousands  except percentages roadway sensors vehicle sensors net sales contract revenues total net sales and contract revenues we currently have a diverse customer base with no individual customer representing greater than of our total net sales and contract revenues for fiscal or  and one customer representing approximately of our net sales and contract revenues in fiscal roadway sensors the majority of roadway sensors net sales were derived from sales within north america 
the decrease in roadway sensors net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was mainly due to reduced and delayed spending on infrastructure projects as a result of the decline in commercial and residential construction  as well as local government budgetary pressures 
we expect the above factors  among others  may continue to adversely impact our roadway sensors net sales for at least the next few fiscal quarters 
the increase in net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily reflects the continued adoption of video vehicle detection technology  such as the technology offered by our vantage line of products  both domestically and internationally 
vehicle sensors the largest element of vehicle sensors net sales was sales of our ldw systems to the heavy truck market  which aggregated approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal vehicle sensors net sales decreased slightly in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to a significant slowdown in overall ldw unit shipments to each of our key markets in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in fiscal net sales of vehicle sensors products  as compared to fiscal  was primarily a result of increased unit sales of our ldw systems to european and asian oems 
recently  we have experienced softness in our ldw unit sales to the north american truck market and to our european and asian oem customers  which was driven largely by the general slowdown in the us and worldwide credit markets and continued weakness in the overall global economy 
we expect declining ldw unit sales for the first quarter of fiscal due to these and other macroeconomic conditions 
additionally  vehicle sensors unit sales in fiscal and beyond could also be adversely impacted by slower than expected adoption rates of our ldw system by european and asian oems and north american heavy truck fleets  as well as potential additional oem volume discounts resulting from increased price competition as new competitors have entered this market 
additionally  certain recent environmental regulations in europe and north america have substantially increased the cost of new commercial trucks  which could impact future truck sales volumes and  ultimately  unit sales of our ldw systems 
also included in vehicle sensors net sales are revenues from contract engineering services  technology access fees and royalty revenues in the passenger car market that are derived from our strategic relationship with valeo  which aggregated approximately million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the total revenues for fiscal included certain technology access fee revenue of  that did not recur in either fiscal or royalty revenues from valeo for sales of our ldw systems for the passenger car market were relatively insignificant in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal our ldw systems are now offered as an option on three infiniti models 
while valeo is promoting our ldw systems to other passenger car oems  we cannot assure you that valeo will be successful in these efforts 

table of contents contract revenues contract revenues are primarily dependent upon the continued availability of funding at both the state and federal levels from the various departments of transportation 
the fiscal increase in contract revenues was largely a result of our increased sales and marketing activity across the us  resulting in certain significant new contracts that were awarded to us during the current fiscal year 
certain of these new contracts contained a higher than usual amount of sub consulting content  which was primarily concentrated in our contract revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal the fiscal increase in contract revenues was largely due to increased funding at the federal  state and local levels throughout the country  as well as new contract awards 
at the end of fiscal  our transportation systems segment s staff levels approximated those of the prior year end  however  in response to the growth we have experienced in our transportation systems segment over the last several years  we increased this segment s staff by in fiscal and in fiscal we believe the ability of our transportation systems business to grow and successfully win and service new contracts will be highly dependent upon our continued success in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel 
all of our contract revenues are derived from work performed in north america under a broad range of fixed price and cost plus fixed fee contracts 
gross profit 
the following tables present details of our gross profit for fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal  respectively fiscal fiscal decrease change in thousands  except percentages total gross profit total gross profit as a of total net sales and contract revenues gross profit as a of net sales gross profit as a of contract revenues fiscal fiscal increase change in thousands  except percentages total gross profit total gross profit as a of total net sales and contract revenues gross profit as a of net sales gross profit as a of contract revenues the decrease in gross profit as a percent of net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily a result of decreased gross profit in roadway sensors and was primarily driven by our customer mix 
roadway sensors net sales were weighted more toward dealer than direct sales in fiscal we generally enjoy higher gross margins on direct sales as compared to dealer and aftermarket sales 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was a result of a favorable sales mix in terms of both geography and product mix  as well as improved production efficiencies 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales also improved in fiscal through the expansion of our vehicle sensors customer base  which helped mitigate the impact of lower contractual pricing to our largest european customer 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales can fluctuate in any specific quarter or year based on  among other factors  customer and product mix  competitive pricing requirements  product warranty costs and provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  as well as possible shifts of engineering resources from development activities to sustaining activities  which we record as cost of goods sold 
we recognize contract revenues and related gross profit using percentage of completion contract accounting  and the underlying mix of contract activity affects the related gross profit recognized in any given period 
the decreases in gross profit as a percent of contract revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflect a contract mix weighted more toward lower margin contracts in those periods 
lower margin contracts generally have a higher proportion of sub consulting revenues associated with them 
we experienced an abnormally high level of sub consulting content related to certain new contracts during the fourth quarter of fiscal  which contributed both to the overall increase in contract revenues  as described above  as well as the decrease in our gross profit 
for the first quarter of fiscal  we do not expect similar levels of sub consulting content  however  due to the variability and timing of our contracts  we may experience higher than usual sub consulting content in future periods 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense the following table presents selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal and fiscal fiscal of net of net sales and sales and contract contract increase amount revenues amount revenues decrease change in thousands  except percentages salary and personnel related facilities  insurance and supplies professional and outside services travel and conferences other selling  general and administrative the overall increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily driven by higher selling expenses in our transportation systems segment as a result of a shift in certain of our labor resources from project related activities to sales and marketing efforts  aimed at capturing additional contract backlog 
this resulted in an increase in this segment s sales and marketing expenses to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal our professional and outside services expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to our efforts to conserve costs and scale back our usage of certain outside and professional services  as well as various efficiencies gained in our internal control assessment and other financial reporting obligations in the current year 
in fiscal  we will be subject to the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  for which we expect additional increases in our general and administrative expenses 
the following table presents selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal and fiscal fiscal of net of net sales and sales and contract contract increase amount revenues amount revenues decrease change in thousands  except percentages salary and personnel related facilities  insurance and supplies professional and outside services travel and conferences other selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was largely attributable to higher commissions and selling expenses driven by sales growth in our roadway sensors segment  as well as general and administrative expenses incurred related to our efforts to comply with the internal control assessment and reporting requirements 

table of contents research and development expense the following table presents research and development expense for fiscal and fiscal fiscal of net of net sales and sales and contract contract increase amount revenues amount revenues decrease change in thousands  except percentages salary and personnel related facilties  development and supplies other research and development the increase in research and development expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased research and development activities in roadway sensors aimed at accelerating the time to market of certain new products 
we believe research and development activities are crucial to our ability to continue to be a leader in our markets 
the following table presents research and development expense for fiscal and fiscal fiscal of net of net sales and sales and contract contract increase amount revenues amount revenues decrease change in thousands  except percentages salary and personnel related facilties  development and supplies other research and development the decrease in research and development expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to reduced research and development activities in vehicle sensors as many of our significant truck oem customers now have production ldw units that only require minimal further development and the majority of our passenger car research and development efforts are funded by our strategic partner  valeo 
this decreased spending was partially offset by increased research and development spending in roadway sensors 
for competitive reasons  we closely guard the confidentiality of specific development projects 
other income expense  net the following table presents other income expense  net for fiscal  and year ended march  in thousands net gain on early extinguishment of debt settlement of lawsuits other other income expense  net other income  net in fiscal includes the net gain of  we recognized in connection with the early retirement of million of convertible debentures  as well as certain net foreign currency gains and other miscellaneous income 
other income  net in fiscal primarily reflects the net gain of  we recognized in connection with the early retirement of million of convertible debentures 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the early retirement of our convertible debentures 
other expense  net in fiscal primarily reflects  of expense recorded in connection with the settlement of litigation in july  which is discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents interest expense  net the following table presents interest expense  net for fiscal  and year ended march  in thousands interest expense interest income interest expense  net interest expense  net decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to our lower overall level of borrowings  lower interest rates and also as a result of the early retirement of certain of our convertible debentures  as discussed above 
income taxes the following table presents our benefit for income taxes for fiscal  and year ended march  in thousands  except percentages income tax benefit effective tax rate the income tax benefits recorded in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were primarily the result of a decrease in the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets as a result of changes in estimates of the future realizability of these assets 
as we update our estimates in future periods  adjustments to our deferred tax asset and valuation allowance may be necessary 
we anticipate this will cause our future overall effective tax rate in any given period to fluctuate from prior effective tax rates and statutory tax rates 
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including  but not limited to  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
at march   we had million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in and  respectively 
due to changes in stock ownership  our federal net operating loss carryforwards are subject to a section limitation estimated at approximately million annually which can be utilized to offset federal consolidated taxable income 
although the impact cannot be precisely determined  we believe that our net operating loss carryforwards will cause us to have future income tax payments and income tax expense that are substantially lower than the income tax liability and income tax expense calculated using statutory tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows we have historically financed our operations with a combination of cash flows from operations  borrowings under credit facilities and the sale of equity securities 
we currently rely on cash flows from operations and the availability of borrowings on a line of credit facility to fund our operations  which we believe to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
at march   we had million in working capital  which included no borrowings on our million line of credit and million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to working capital of million at march  
table of contents the following table summarizes our cash flows for fiscal  and year ended march  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
cash provided by our operations in fiscal was primarily the result of our fiscal net income of million adjusted for certain non cash items within the statement of operations  primarily adjustments to our deferred tax balances and depreciation and stock based compensation expenses 
our net accounts receivable decreased approximately  from march  to march  due primarily to lower product sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the corresponding quarter in the prior year 
additionally  our net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings decreased approximately million over the same period  primarily as a result of improved timeliness of billings in our transportation systems segment during fiscal if  in the longer term  our net sales and contract revenues increase  it is likely that both our accounts receivable and net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings balances will also increase 
our accounts receivable could also increase if customers delay their payments or if we grant extended payment terms to customers  both of which are more likely to occur during challenging economic times when our customers may face issues gaining sufficient credit on a timely basis 
inventories increased approximately million from march  to march  due primarily to a decrease in product sales  the introduction of new products by our roadway sensors segment and the acquisition of certain components because they have been discontinued by the manufacturer 
in the future  our inventory levels are likely to continue to be determined based upon  among other factors  the level of purchase orders we receive  the stage at which our products are in their respective product life cycles  and competitive situations in the marketplace 
we attempt to balance such considerations against risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
cash provided by our operations in fiscal was primarily a result of our fiscal net income of million and million in net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities  partially offset by approximately million in net non cash items within the statement of operations 
during fiscal  cash used in operations was primarily a result of investments in inventory due to sales growth and longer lead times in procuring certain components  and an increased level of net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings due to sales growth and the timing of invoicing on contracts in our transportation systems segment 
these were partially offset by our fiscal net income of million 
investing activities 
investing activities for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal each consisted primarily of purchases of certain property and equipment 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was the result of  in cash inflows from the exercise of stock options to purchase our common stock  partially offset by net payments on our borrowings of  net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was the result of net payments on our borrowings of million  partially offset by cash inflows of million from the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase our common stock 
during fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was the result of cash inflows of million from the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase our common stock  of which approximately million was raised through the exercise of outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
these cash inflows were partially offset by net payments on our borrowings of million 
borrowings the following table summarizes our borrowings and long term debt march  in thousands convertible debentures  net bank term note 
table of contents prior to october   we had a credit facility with a bank that provided for line of credit borrowings of up to million 
under this credit facility  we could borrow against our eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory  as defined in the credit agreement 
interest on borrowed amounts under the line of credit was payable monthly at the current stated prime rate plus 
additionally  we were obligated to pay an unused line fee of per annum applied to the amount by which the maximum credit amount exceeded the average daily principal balance during the preceding month 
the credit facility required  in monthly collateral management fees and included an early termination fee equal to of the total facility during the first year of the agreement and of the total facility in the second year of the agreement 
the credit facility was secured by substantially all of our assets 
this credit facility expired on october  effective october   we entered into a new million credit facility with a different bank california bank trust which replaced our existing credit facility 
this new credit facility provides for a two year revolving line of credit with borrowings of up to million and a million month term note discussed below 
interest on borrowed amounts under the revolving line of credit will be payable monthly at a rate equal to the current stated prime rate up to the current stated prime rate plus  depending on aggregate deposit balances maintained at the bank in relation to the total loan commitment under the credit facility at march  
we are obligated to pay an unused line fee of per annum applied to the average unused portion of the revolving line of credit during the preceding month 
the revolving line of credit does not contain any early termination fees and is secured by substantially all of our assets 
as of march   no amounts were borrowed under the revolving line of credit portion of the facility 
additionally  as part of this new credit facility and in connection with the early retirement of million of our convertible debentures  as of march  we have borrowed million under the million month term note to retire such outstanding debentures 
in may  we borrowed an additional  under the term note to pay off the remaining convertible debentures of the same amount 
principal payments under this term note are required to be repaid in monthly installments commencing on june  interest on the term note will be payable monthly at a rate equal to the current stated prime rate plus up to the current stated prime rate plus  depending on aggregate deposit balances maintained at the bank in relation to the total loan commitment under the credit facility 
in october  we paid an upfront loan commitment fee of  in connection with the term note portion of the credit facility 
the term note contains no early termination fees and  along with our revolving line of credit discussed above  is secured by substantially all of our assets 
in connection with our credit facility and loan agreement with california bank trust  we are also required to comply with certain quarterly financial covenants 
these include achieving certain ratios for working capital and debt service  as well as maintaining a level of profitability  all of which are further defined in the agreement 
while we are currently in compliance with all financial covenants and expect to maintain compliance for the foreseeable future  we cannot assure that we will not violate one or more covenants in the future 
if we were to be in violation of covenants under this agreement  our lender could choose to accelerate payment on all outstanding loan balances 
in this event  there can be no assurances that we would be able to quickly obtain equivalent or suitable replacement financing 
if we were not able to secure alternative sources of financing  such acceleration would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition
