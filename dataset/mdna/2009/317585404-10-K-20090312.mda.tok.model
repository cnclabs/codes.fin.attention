table of contents supervision and regulation general fii and fsb are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations that impose restrictions on  and provide for regulatory oversight of  fii s and fsb s operations 
these laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors and not shareholders 
any change in any applicable statute or regulation could have a material effect on fii s and fsb s business 
the supervision and regulation of financial and bank holding companies and their subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of depositors  the deposit insurance funds regulated by the fdic and the banking system as a whole  and not for the protection of shareholders or creditors of bank holding companies 
the various bank regulatory agencies have broad enforcement power over bank holding companies and banks  including the power to impose substantial fines  operational restrictions and other penalties for violations of laws and regulations 
the company is also affected by various governmental requirements and regulations  general economic conditions  and the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the frb 
the monetary policies of the frb influence to a significant extent the overall growth of loans  investments  deposits  interest rates charged on loans  and interest rates paid on deposits 
the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies are often not predictable 
the following description summarizes some of the laws to which the company is subject 
references to applicable statutes and regulations are brief summaries and do not claim to be complete 
they are qualified in their entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations 
management believes the company is in compliance in all material respects with these laws and regulations 
changes in the laws  regulations or policies that impact the company cannot necessarily be predicted  but they may have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations  or liquidity 
regulation of fii fii is a financial holding company registered under the bank holding company act of  as amended  and is subject to supervision  regulation and examination by the frb 
the bank holding company act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage  and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities  including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations 
regulatory restrictions on dividends  source of strength 
it is the policy of the frb that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year  and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the holding company s expected future needs and financial condition 
the policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company s ability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiaries 
under frb policy  a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of its subsidiaries and commit resources to their support 
such support may be required at times when  absent this frb policy  a holding company may not be inclined to provide it 
as discussed below  a bank holding company in certain circumstances could be required to guarantee the capital plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary 
safe and sound banking practices 
bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices 
the frb s regulation y  for example  generally requires a holding company to give the frb prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities  if the consideration to be paid  together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year  is equal to or more of the company s consolidated net worth 
the frb may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation 
depending upon the circumstances  the frb could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
the frb has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non banking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations  and can assess civil money penalties for certain activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis  if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution 
the penalties can be as high as  for each day the activity continues 
anti tying restrictions 
bank holding companies and their affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of certain services  such as extensions of credit  to other services offered by a holding company or its affiliates 
in  the frb adopted regulation w  a comprehensive synthesis of prior opinions and interpretations under sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
regulation w contains an extensive discussion of tying arrangements  which could impact the way banks and bank holding companies transact business with affiliates 

table of contents capital adequacy requirements 
the frb has adopted a system using risk based capital guidelines to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies 
under the guidelines  specific categories of assets are assigned different risk weights  based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset 
these risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a risk weighted asset base 
the guidelines require a minimum total risk based capital ratio of of which at least is required to consist of tier capital elements 
total capital is the sum of tier and tier capital 
as of december   the company s ratio of tier capital to total risk weighted assets was and the ratio of total capital to total risk weighted assets was 
see also the section titled capital resources in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note  regulatory matters  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the risk based capital guidelines  the frb uses a leverage ratio as an additional tool to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies 
the leverage ratio is a company s tier capital divided by quarterly average consolidated assets 
certain highly rated bank holding companies may maintain a minimum leverage ratio of  but other bank holding companies may be required to maintain a leverage ratio of up to basis points above the regulatory minimum 
as of december   the company s leverage ratio was 
the federal banking agencies risk based and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria  assuming that they have the highest regulatory rating 
banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios 
the federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant 
frb guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
imposition of liability for undercapitalized subsidiaries 
bank regulators are required to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions whose capital declines below certain levels 
in the event an institution becomes undercapitalized  it must submit a capital restoration plan 
the capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiary s compliance with the capital restoration plan up to a certain specified amount 
any such guarantee from a depository institution holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy 
the aggregate liability of the holding company of an undercapitalized bank is limited to the lesser of of the institution s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to cause the institution to be adequately capitalized 
the bank regulators have greater power in situations where an institution becomes significantly or critically undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan 
for example  a bank holding company controlling such an institution can be required to obtain prior frb approval of proposed dividends  or might be required to consent to a consolidation or to divest the troubled institution or other affiliates 
acquisitions by bank holding companies 
the bank holding company act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the frb before it may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank  or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank  if after such acquisition it would own or control  directly or indirectly  more than of the voting shares of such bank 
in approving bank acquisitions by bank holding companies  the frb is required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks involved  the convenience and needs of the communities to be served  and various competitive factors 
control acquisitions 
the change in bank control act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring control of a bank holding company unless the frb has been notified and has not objected to the transaction 
under a rebuttable presumption established by the frb  the acquisition of or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under section of the exchange act  would  under the circumstances set forth in the presumption  constitute acquisition of control of the company 
in addition  any entity is required to obtain the approval of the frb under the bank holding company act before acquiring in the case of an acquirer that is a bank holding company or more of the company s outstanding common stock  or otherwise obtaining control or a controlling influence over the company 

table of contents regulation of fsb five star bank fsb or the bank is a new york state chartered bank and a member of the federal reserve system 
the fdic  through the bank insurance fund  insures deposits of the bank 
the supervision and regulation of fsb subjects the bank to special restrictions  requirements  potential enforcement actions and periodic examination by the fdic  the frb and the new york state banking department 
because the frb regulates the holding company parent  the frb also has supervisory authority that directly affects fsb 
restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders 
transactions between the holding company and its subsidiaries  including the bank  are subject to section a of the federal reserve act  and to the requirements of regulation w 
in general  section a imposes limits on the amount of such transactions  and also requires certain levels of collateral for loans to affiliated parties 
it also limits the amount of advances to third parties  which are collateralized by the securities  or obligations of fii or its subsidiaries 
affiliate transactions are also subject to section b of the federal reserve act  and to the requirements of regulation w which generally requires that certain transactions between the holding company and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the bank  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated persons 
the restrictions on loans to directors  executive officers  principal shareholders and their related interests collectively referred to herein as insiders contained in the federal reserve act and regulation o apply to all insured institutions and their subsidiaries and holding companies 
these restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made 
there is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and their related interests 
these loans cannot exceed the institution s total unimpaired capital and surplus  and the fdic may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate 
insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions 
restrictions on distribution of subsidiary bank dividends and assets 
dividends paid by the bank provide a substantial part of fii s operating funds and  for the foreseeable future  it is anticipated that dividends paid by the bank will continue to be its principal source of operating funds 
capital adequacy requirements serve to limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the subsidiaries 
under federal law  the subsidiaries cannot pay a dividend if  after paying the dividend  a particular subsidiary will be undercapitalized 
the fdic may declare a dividend payment to be unsafe and unsound even though the bank would continue to meet its capital requirements after the dividend 
because fii is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries  fii s right to participate in the distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon the subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution  the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of any obligation of the institution to its shareholders  including any depository bank holding company such as fii or any shareholder or creditor thereof

audit reports 
insured institutions with total assets of million or more at the beginning of a fiscal year must submit annual audit reports prepared by independent auditors to federal and state regulators 
in some instances  the audit report of the institution s holding company can be used to satisfy this requirement 
auditors must receive examination reports  supervisory agreements and reports of enforcement actions 
in addition  financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  management s certifications concerning responsibility for the financial statements  internal controls and compliance with legal requirements designated by the fdic  and if total assets exceed billion  an attestation by the auditor regarding the statements of management relating to the internal controls must be submitted 
the fdic improvement act of requires that independent audit committees be formed  consisting of outside directors only 
the committees of institutions with assets of more than billion must include members with experience in banking or financial management must have access to outside counsel and must not include representatives of large customers 
capital adequacy requirements 
the fdic has adopted regulations establishing minimum requirements for the capital adequacy of insured institutions 
the fdic may establish higher minimum requirements if  for example  a bank has previously received special attention or has a high susceptibility to interest rate risk 
the most recent notification from the fdic categorized the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
the fdic s risk based capital guidelines generally require banks to have a minimum ratio of tier capital to total risk weighted assets of and a ratio of total capital to total risk weighted assets of 
the capital categories have the same definitions for the company 
as of december   the ratio of tier capital to total risk weighted assets for the bank was and the ratio of total capital to total risk weighted assets was 
the fdic s leverage guidelines require banks to maintain tier capital of no less than of average total assets  except in the case of certain highly rated banks for which the requirement is of average total assets 
as of december   the ratio of tier capital to quarterly average total assets leverage ratio was for fsb

table of contents corrective measures for capital deficiencies 
the federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action with respect to capital deficient institutions

an adequately capitalized bank has a total risk based capital ratio of or higher  a tier risk based capital ratio of or higher  a leverage ratio of or higher or higher if the bank was rated a composite in its most recent examination report and is not experiencing significant growth  and does not meet the criteria for a well capitalized bank 
a bank is undercapitalized if it fails to meet any one of the adequately capitalized ratios 
in addition to requiring undercapitalized institutions to submit a capital restoration plan  agency regulations contain broad restrictions on certain activities of undercapitalized institutions including asset growth  acquisitions  branch establishment and expansion into new lines of business 
with certain exceptions  an insured depository institution is prohibited from making capital distributions  including dividends  and is prohibited from paying management fees to control persons if the institution would be undercapitalized after any such distribution or payment

impact of inflation and changing prices the company s financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
gaap requires the company to measure financial position and operating results principally using historic dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
in the company s view  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate 
while interest rates are generally influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude 
interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the company  including changes in the expected rate of inflation  general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities 

table of contents regulatory and economic policies the company s business and earnings are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities 
the frb regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions 
among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are i conducting open market operations in us government obligations  ii changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings  iii imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits  and iv restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by financial institutions and their affiliates 
these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits  as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
for that reason  the policies of the frb could have a material effect on the earnings of the company

table of contents item a 
risk factors making or continuing an investment in securities issued by the company  including its common stock  involves certain risks that you should carefully consider 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on the company 
additional risks and uncertainties also could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected  the market price for your securities could decline  and you could lose all or a part of your investment 
further  to the extent that any of the information contained in this annual report on form k constitutes forward looking statements  the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the company s business may be adversely impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing unprecedented levels of volatility and disruption for more than a year 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
as a consequence of the recession that the united states now finds itself in  business activity across a wide range of industries face serious difficulties due to the lack of consumer spending and the extreme lack of liquidity in the global credit markets 
unemployment has also increased significantly 
a sustained weakness or weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which the company does business could have one or more of the following material adverse impacts on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the company  a decrease in the value of our loans held for sale or other assets secured by consumer or commercial real estate  an impairment of certain intangible assets  such as goodwill  an increase in the number of clients and counterparties who become delinquent  file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the company 
an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of non performing assets  net charge offs  provision for loan losses  and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale 
current market developments may adversely impact the company s industry and business 
dramatic declines in the housing market during the prior year  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment  have resulted in  and may continue to result in  significant write downs of asset values by the company and other financial institutions  including government sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks 
these write downs  initially of mortgage backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities  have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers including financial institutions 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of consumer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally 
the resulting lack of available credit  lack of confidence in the financial sector  increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
further negative market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which may impact our charge offs and provisions for credit losses 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on the financial services industry and could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company is subject to liquidity risks 
the company maintains liquidity primarily through customer deposits and other funding sources 
if economic influences change so that we do not have access to short term credit  or our depositors withdraw a substantial amount of their funds for other uses  five star bank might experience liquidity issues 
our efforts to monitor and manage liquidity risk may not be successful or sufficient to deal with dramatic or unanticipated reductions in our liquidity 
in such events  our cost of funds may increase  thereby reducing our net interest revenue  or we may need to sell a portion of our investment portfolio  which  depending upon market conditions  could result in our realizing a loss 

table of contents the soundness of other financial institutions  including federal home loan bank  could adversely impact the company 
the company s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of counterparty relationships 
the company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry 
the most important counterparty for the company  in terms of liquidity  is the federal home loan bank of new york fhlbny 
the company uses fhlbny as its primary source of long term wholesale funding 
at december   the company had a total of million in borrowed funds with fhlbny 
there are twelve branches of the federal home loan bank fhlb  including new york 
several members have warned that they have either breached risk based capital requirements or that they are close to breaching those requirements 
to conserve capital  some fhlb branches are suspending dividends  cutting dividend payments  and not buying back excess fhlb stock that members hold 
fhlbny has stated that they expect to be able to continue to pay dividends  redeem excess capital stock  and provide competitively priced advances in the future 
the most severe problems in the fhlb system have been at some of the other fhlb branches 
nonetheless  the twelve fhlb branches are jointly liable for the consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
to the extent that one fhlb branch cannot meet its obligations to pay its share of debt  other fhlb branches may be called upon to make the payment 
as a member of the fhlb system  the company is required to hold stock in fhlbny 
the carrying value and fair value of the company s fhlbny common stock as of december  was million based on its par value 
in an extreme situation  it is possible that the capitalization of an fhlb  including fhlbny  could be substantially diminished or reduced to zero 
consequently  given that there is no market for the company s fhlbny common stock  there is a risk that the investment could be determined to be impaired in the future 
deterioration in the soundness of fhlbny or the fhlb system could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
the value of certain securities in the company s investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by disruptions in the market for these securities 
in addition to interest rate risk typically associated with an investment portfolio  the market for certain investment securities held within the company s investment portfolio has  over the past year  become much less liquid 
this coupled with uncertainly surrounding the credit risk associated with the underlying collateral has caused material discrepancies in valuation estimates obtained from third parties 
the company values some of its investments using internally developed cash flow and valuation models  which include certain subjective estimates which are believed to reflect the estimates a purchaser of such securities would use if such a transaction were to occur 
the volatile market may affect the value of these securities  such as through reduced valuations due to the perception of heightened credit and liquidity risks  in addition to interest rate risk typically associated with these securities 
there can be no assurance that the declines in market value associated with these disruptions will not result in impairments of these assets  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
fdic insurance premiums may increase materially 
the fdic insures deposits at fdic insured financial institutions  including fsb 
the fdic charges the insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund at a certain level 
current economic conditions have increased bank failures and expectations for further failures  in which case the fdic ensures payments of deposits up to insured limits from the deposit insurance fund 
in december and again in february  the fdic adopted rules that will increase premiums paid by insured institutions and make other changes to the assessment system 
significant increases in deposit insurance premiums could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
there can be no assurance that the eesa and other recently enacted government programs will help stabilize the us financial system 
on october   the eesa was signed into law by the president 
the legislation was the result of a proposal by the secretary of the treasury on september  in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions 
the us treasury and federal banking regulators are implementing a number of programs under this legislation and otherwise to address capital and liquidity issues in the banking system  including the cpp  in which the company participates 
in addition  other regulators have taken steps to attempt to stabilize and add liquidity to the financial markets  such as the fdic s tlgp 
on february   the secretary of the treasury announced the financial stability plan  which earmarks the second billion originally authorized under the eesa 
the financial stability plan is intended to  among other things  make capital available to financial institutions  purchase certain legacy loans and assets from financial institutions  restart securitization markets for loans to consumers and businesses and relieve certain pressures on the housing market  including the reduction of mortgage payments and interest rates 

table of contents in addition  the arra  which was signed into law on february   includes  among other things  extensive new restrictions on the compensation arrangements of financial institutions participating in tarp 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the actual impact that the eesa  as supplemented by the financial stability plan  the arra and other programs will have on the financial markets  including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced 
the failure of the eesa  the arra  the financial stability plan and other programs to stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit or the trading price of the company s common stock 
the eesa  arra and the financial stability plan are relatively new initiatives and  as such  are subject to change and evolving interpretation 
there can be no assurances as to the effects that any further changes will have on the effectiveness of the government s efforts to stabilize the credit markets and economy or on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
the limitations on incentive compensation contained in the arra may adversely affect the company s ability to retain its highest performing employees 
the company received cpp funds and the arra contains restrictions on bonus and other incentive compensation payable to the five executives named in the company s proxy statement 
depending upon the limitations placed on incentive compensation by the final regulations issued under the arra  it is possible that the company may be unable to create a compensation structure that permits it to retain its highest performing employees 
if this were to occur  it could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
participants in the cpp are subject to certain restrictions on dividends  repurchases of common stock and executive compensation 
the company is subject to restrictions on dividends  repurchases of common stock  and executive compensation 
compliance with these restrictions and other restrictions may increase the company s costs and limit its ability to pursue business opportunities 
additionally  any reduction of  or the elimination of  the company s common stock dividend in the future could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
the current restrictions  as well as any possible future restrictions  associated with participation in the cpp could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations 
the company may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all 
the company may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet the company s commitments and business needs 
the company s ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on  among other things  conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside of the company s control  and its financial performance 
the ongoing liquidity crisis and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase the company s cost of funding and limit its access to some of its customary sources of capital 
the company cannot assure that such capital will be available to it on acceptable terms or at all 
any occurrence that may limit the company s access to the capital markets  such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers  depositors of five star bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets  or a downgrade of the company s debt rating  may adversely affect the company s capital costs and ability to raise capital and  in turn  its liquidity 
an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
fii is a holding company and is dependent on its banking subsidiary for dividends  distributions and other payments 
the parent company  fii  is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries 
fii s principal source of cash flow  including cash flow to pay dividends to its shareholders and principal and interest on its outstanding debt  is dividends from five star bank 
there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by fsb to the parent company  as well as by fii to its shareholders 
regulations of both the federal reserve and the state of new york affect the ability of fsb to pay dividends and other distributions  as well as make loans to fii 
given the loss recorded at fsb during the year ended december   under new york state banking department rules  fsb does not expect to be able to pay dividends to fii in the near term without first obtaining regulatory approval 
if fsb is unable to make dividend payments to fii and sufficient capital is not otherwise available  fii may not be able to make dividend payments to its common shareholders or principal and interest payments on its outstanding debt 
see also the section titled supervision and regulation restrictions on distribution of subsidiary bank dividends and assets of this annual report on form k 

table of contents the company may not pay dividends on its common stock 
shareholders of the company s common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as the company s board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments 
although the company has historically declared cash dividends on its common stock  it is not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate its common stock dividend in the future 
this could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
also  participation in the cpp limits our ability to increase our dividend or to repurchase our common stock  for so long as any securities issued under such program remain outstanding  as discussed in greater detail below 
if the company experiences greater credit losses than anticipated  earnings may be adversely impacted 
as a lender  the company is exposed to the risk that its customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment 
credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of its loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of its borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral  and provides an allowance for estimated loan losses based on a number of factors 
the company believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
however  if the company s assumptions or judgments are wrong  its allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover its actual credit losses 
the company may have to increase the allowance in the future in response to the request of one of its primary banking regulators  to adjust for changing conditions and assumptions  or as a result of any deterioration in the quality of its loan portfolio 
the actual amount of future provisions for credit losses may vary from the amount of past provisions 
geographic concentration in one market may unfavorably impact the company s operations 
substantially all of the company s business and operations are concentrated in the western and central new york region 
as a result of this geographic concentration  the company s results depend largely on economic conditions in these and surrounding areas 
deterioration in economic conditions in this market could increase loan delinquencies  increase problem assets and foreclosures  increase claims and lawsuits  decrease the demand for our products and services  and decrease the value of collateral for loans  especially real estate  in turn reducing customers borrowing power  the value of assets associated with non performing loans and collateral coverage 
generally  the company makes loans to small to mid sized businesses whose success depends on the regional economy 
these businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities 
adverse economic and business conditions in these market areas could reduce the company s growth rate  affect our borrowers ability to repay their loans and  consequently  adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and performance 
for example  the company places substantial reliance on real estate as collateral for its loan portfolio 
a sharp downturn in real estate values in our market area could leave many of these loans inadequately collateralized 
if the company is required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values  the impact on the company s results of operations could be materially adverse 
see also the section titled market area and competition of this annual report on form k 
the market price of shares of the company s common stock may fluctuate 
the market price of the company s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to a change in sentiment in the market regarding the company s operations or business prospects 
such risks may be affected by operating results that vary from the expectations of management  securities analysts and investors  developments in the company s business or in the financial sector generally  regulatory changes affecting the financial services industry generally or the company s business and operations  the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to the company  announcements of strategic developments  acquisitions and other material events by the company or its competitors  changes in the credit  mortgage and real estate markets  including the markets for mortgage related securities  and changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions  such as interest or foreign exchange rates  stock  commodity  credit or asset valuations or volatility 

table of contents stock markets in general and the company s common stock in particular have  over the past year  and continue to be experiencing significant price and volume volatility 
as a result  the market price of the company s common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations that may be unrelated to its operating performance or prospects 
increased volatility could result in a decline in the market price of the company s common stock and may make it more difficult for shareholders to liquidate the common stock 
future issuances of additional securities could result in dilution of your ownership 
the company may determine from time to time to issue additional securities to raise additional capital  support growth  or to make acquisitions 
further  the company may issue stock options or other stock grants to retain and motivate its employees 
these issuances of the company s securities may dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders 
the company s market value could result in an impairment of goodwill 
the company s goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis at september  or when triggering events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist 
during the fourth quarter of  the company experienced a decline in its market capitalization  therefore the company evaluated its goodwill as of december  and concluded that there was no impairment 
in the first quarter of  the company has experienced further declines in its market capitalization as its common stock has been trading at a price significantly below its book value 
significant and sustained declines in the company s stock price and market capitalization  significant declines in the company s expected future cash flows  significant adverse changes in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in impairment of goodwill 
if impairment of goodwill was determined to exist  the company would be required to write down its goodwill as a charge to earnings  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
for further discussion  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  goodwill and other intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
changes in interest rates could adversely impact the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the banking industry s earnings depend largely on the relationship between the yield on earning assets  primarily loans and investments  and the cost of funds  primarily deposits and borrowings 
this relationship  known as the interest rate spread  is subject to fluctuation and is affected by economic and competitive factors which influence interest rates  the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the level of non performing assets 
fluctuations in interest rates affect the demand of customers for the company s products and services 
the bank is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that interest bearing liabilities re price or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than interest earning assets 
significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
for additional information regarding interest rate risk  see part ii  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this annual report on form k 
industry competition may have an adverse impact on the company s success 
the company s profitability depends on its ability to compete successfully 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment where certain of its competitors are larger and have more resources 
in the company s market areas  it faces competition from commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  internet banks  finance companies  insurance companies  brokerage and investment banking firms  and other financial intermediaries that offer similar services 
some of the company s non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern fii or fsb and may have greater flexibility in competing for business 
the company expects competition to intensify among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions and the conversion of certain investment banks to bank holding companies 
should competition in the financial services industry intensify  the company s ability to market its products and services may be adversely impacted 
the company s deferred tax assets may not ultimately be realized or its tax positions may be subject to challenge by the irs 
the company s deferred tax assets may provide significant future tax savings to the company 
the company s use of these deferred tax benefits may depend on a number of factors including the ability of the company to generate significant taxable income  the absence of a future ownership change of the company that could limit or eliminate the tax benefits  the acceptance by the taxing authorities of the positions taken on the company s tax returns as to the amount and timing of its income and expenses  and future changes in laws or regulations relating to tax deductions and net operating losses 
the company assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realizable based on future taxable income and  if necessary  establishes a valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets determined to not likely be realizable 
management judgment is required in determining the appropriate recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  including projections of future taxable income 
there can be no absolute assurance  however  that the net deferred assets will ultimately be realized 

table of contents the company s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
the company depends upon data processing  software  communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks and over the internet 
despite instituted safeguards  the company cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures 
the company relies on the services of a variety of vendors to meet its data processing and communication needs 
if information security is breached or other technology difficulties or failures occur  information may be lost or misappropriated  services and operations may be interrupted and the company could be exposed to claims from customers 
any of these results could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity
