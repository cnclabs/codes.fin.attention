our rainbow casino faces intense direct competition from other gaming facilities servicing the vicksburg market  and  to a lesser degree  indirect competition from those servicing the gulf coast region 
a new casino project adjacent to the rainbow casino opened in late october and a nearby competitor property recently expanded its casino and added slot machines and the market s largest live poker room 
product development we believe providing gaming devices  content and systems with high entertainment value and key operational advantages coupled with a high level of customer service is important to gaining market share 
our global product development for new and emerging technologies  including many server based systems solutions  is primarily led through the bally innovation lab 
this lab focuses on emerging and paradigm shifting technologies through research and development of new gaming technologies  features  and products and was designed to accelerate the commercial deployment of the most cutting edge gaming devices  content and systems technologies 
our product development process for our gaming devices and content includes both hardware and software 
major areas of hardware development include cabinet style  technical capability  interfaces  peripheral devices  and coin and currency handling 
hardware development efforts are focused on player appeal  product reliability and ease of maintenance 
development cycles for hardware can range from a few days for simple enhancements to more than a year for new electronics or new mechanical packages 
the software development process for new game content  which includes graphics development  is continuous and requires a significant commitment of human resources 
creativity in software development is an important element in the market success and player appeal of our gaming devices 
innovations in our development process and game design are generated internally  by customers and by third parties  many of whom have entered into strategic relationships with us 
product development for casino enterprise systems also includes hardware and software 
the major areas of hardware development include controller circuit board design and programming  as well as user interface devices such as card readers  keypads and displays 
software development includes extensive application development  including elements such as databases  interfaces and protocols used in emerging technologies  including many server based systems solutions  communication  security and automated backup and failure procedures 
we have developed a modular and extendible hardware and software architecture which focuses development on achieving greater functionality  product reliability  ease of maintenance for the casino operator  and ease of use for the player 
in addition  the architecture allows customers to upgrade existing components or add new components with less impact as compared to a complete replacement 
development cycles for hardware can vary between a few months for minor revisions to more than a year for major design changes 
software development results in periodic product releases that include new features that extend or enhance the casino enterprise systems 
less significant revisions such as periodic maintenance releases are also deployed to enable casino operators to correct problems or improve the usability of the system 
our total expenditures for research and development were million  million and million during the years ended june   and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenditures over this three year period reflects our corporate focus on our technology assets  the expansion of technical resources through purchases of core technology assets  and the competitive landscape that requires continuous development of future generations of gaming products and systems 
sales and marketing we have a direct sales force consisting of approximately employees located in multiple offices  primarily in north america 
we also  to a lesser extent  utilize an independent distributor network to distribute our products 
the agreements we have with distributors generally specify minimum purchases and also provide that we may terminate the relationship if certain performance standards are not met 
the sale of gaming devices takes place throughout our fiscal year and can range from proposals for a small quantity of units to several thousand units 
we conduct one on one meetings with our customers to demonstrate our products at their locations  host customers to private demonstrations in our offices or at offsite venues  and participate in a number of trade shows domestically and internationally each year 
in certain cases  we participate in responding to competitive requests for proposals from private and public entities seeking to purchase gaming equipment 
for casino enterprise system sales  we offer our customers the option of signing separate hardware and software maintenance agreements at the time of sale 
these agreements are typically for one year terms and automatically renew unless otherwise canceled in writing by either party 
after an initial warranty period  typically days  the customer is invoiced monthly for hardware and software maintenance fees that provide for  among other things  repair or replacement of malfunctioning hardware and software  software version upgrades  and on call support for software 
the sale of enterprise systems is often a long process  at times extending beyond one year 
typically  a potential systems customer will participate in a formal evaluation and selection of a system vendor 
the level of sales available to us at any point in time can vary materially due to a number of factors  including the capital budgets of our customers  availability of new product modules  timing associated with regulatory approvals  and the success and features contained in the products sold by our competitors 
the price paid for a full system can vary materially from customer to customer depending on a number of factors  including but not limited to  the size of the gaming operation and the number of functions contained in the system specified 
product markets we believe that the total installed base of gaming devices in the united states is between  and  units 
this total includes land based  riverboat  native american casinos and video lottery markets 
new sales opportunities for gaming devices in the united states and canada are primarily driven by replacement of existing units  new casino openings or expansions and the legalization of gaming in new markets 
the gaming industry also continues to expand in international markets 
europe  latin america  south america  mexico and the pacific rim are currently our primary international markets 
we regularly evaluate expanding our business into additional international markets

our international business is conducted primarily from offices in amsterdam  netherlands for customers in europe  puerto rico for customers in the caribbean latin america  buenos aires  argentina for customers in south america  mexico city for customers in mexico  and macau  china for customers in the pacific rim 
the primary markets for casino enterprise systems are the united states and  to a lesser extent  canada  south america  europe  the pacific rim and the caribbean latin america  though additional international markets are beginning to emerge 
the market for our casino enterprise systems includes new casino openings  expansions  upgrades of existing facilities and the competitive replacement of other systems 
we also generate new system sales through the introduction of new hardware and software products 
in many cases  domestic regulations require the implementation of a system as part of their operational requirements while international markets have only recently begun the full implementation of such systems 
we believe  as international markets begin to mature and become more competitive  the use of systems will become more common 
competition and product demand the demand for gaming devices  content and systems varies depending on the level of new construction and renovation of casinos as well as market conditions that might generate the need for new and replacement equipment and product innovation 
for the year ended june   our largest customers  including corporate customers with multiple casino properties  accounted for approximately of gaming device sales 
the demand for casino enterprise systems is driven by regulatory requirements in each applicable jurisdiction and by casino operators competitive need to properly track device and player activity and to establish and compile individual device and player profitability and other demographic information 
these features enable casinos to develop or enhance marketing strategies 
as more and more casinos move to high speed networked floors  we expect the demand for new systems technologies will increase as casinos replace older systems with new server based systems solutions 
revenues for casino enterprise systems are derived from selling products to new or existing customers 
for the year ended june   the largest casino enterprise system customers  which include certain multi site casino operators that have corporate agreements  accounted for approximately of game monitoring unit sales revenues  with the largest single customer accounting for of these revenues 
we compete with a number of domestic and international businesses in the various geographic markets where we sell our products

our principal competition in casino management systems currently consists of  among others  igt  aristocrat  konami and several smaller competitive providers in the international market 
competition is keen in this market due to the number of providers and the limited number of casinos and jurisdictions in which they operate

if the mississippi commission were to determine that we  or any of our licensed gaming subsidiaries  violated a gaming law or regulation  the mississippi commission could limit  condition  suspend  or revoke our approvals and the license of the subsidiary could subject us to substantial fines 
because of such a violation  the mississippi commission could seek to appoint a supervisor to operate our casino facilities 
limitation  conditioning  suspension or revocation of any gaming license or approval or the appointment of a supervisor could materially adversely affect us

depending on the particular fee or tax involved  these fees and taxes are payable either monthly  quarterly  or annually and are based on i a percentage of the gross gaming revenues received by the casino operation  ii the number of gaming devices operated by the casino  or iii the number of table games operated by the casino 
the license fee payable to the state of mississippi is based upon gaming revenues generally defined as gross revenues less payouts to customers as winnings  and the maximum rate is of gaming revenues 
the gross revenue fee imposed by the city of vicksburg  mississippi  where rcvp s casino operations are located  equals approximately of gaming revenues 
the sale of alcoholic beverages by rainbow casino is subject to the licensing  control and regulation by both the city of vicksburg and the alcoholic beverage control division the abc of the mississippi state tax commission

risk factors our business and investing in our common stock involves risk 
prospective investors in our common stock should carefully consider  among other things  the following factors and other information contained in this annual report on form k  including our financial statements and the notes to those statements  prior to making an investment decision 
we have identified the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements we may make from time to time 
our success in the gaming industry depends in large part on our ability to develop innovative products and systems 
if we fail to keep pace with rapid innovations in new technologies or product design and deployment  or if we are unable to quickly adapt our development and manufacturing processes to release innovative products or systems  our business could be negatively impacted 
our success is heavily dependent on our ability to develop and sell new products and systems that are attractive not only to our customers  namely casino operators and other gaming enterprises  but also to their customers  the end players 
furthermore  if our gaming devices deployed in gaming operations do not meet or sustain revenue and profitability expectations they may be replaced by our competitor s devices 
therefore  our future success depends upon our ability to continue to design and market technologically sophisticated products that meet our customer s needs regarding  among other things  ease of use and adaptability  but also that are unique and entertaining such that they achieve high levels of player appeal and sustainability 
if our competitors develop new game content and technologically innovative products and systems and we fail to keep pace  our business could be adversely affected 
the demands of our customers and the preferences of the end players are continuously changing 
as a result  there is constant pressure to develop and market new game content and technologically innovative products 
as our revenues are heavily dependent on the earning power and life span of our games and because newer game themes tend to have a shorter life span than more traditional game themes  we face increased pressure to design and deploy new and successful game themes to maintain our revenue stream and remain competitive 
while we feel we have been successful at developing new and innovative products  our ability to do so could be adversely affected by a decline in the popularity of our gaming products with end players  a decision by our customers or the gaming industry in general to cut back on purchases of new gaming devices or to cancel or return previous orders  content or systems in anticipation of newer technologies  an inability to roll out new games  services or systems on schedule as a result of delays in regulatory product approval in the applicable jurisdictions  or otherwise  and an increase in the popularity of competitors games 
our newer products are generally more technologically sophisticated than those we have produced in the past and we must continually refine our production capabilities to meet the needs of our product innovation 
if we cannot adapt our manufacturing infrastructure to meet the needs of our product innovations  or if we are unable to make upgrades to our production capacity in a timely manner  our business could be negatively impacted 
the gaming industry is intensely competitive 
we face competition from a number of companies  some of whom have greater resources  and if we are unable to compete effectively  our business could be negatively impacted 
bally gaming and systems competition among gaming machine manufacturers is intense and is primarily based on the amount of profit our products generate for our customers in relation to our competitors products 
additionally  we compete on the basis of price and financing terms made available to customers  the appeal of game content and features to the end player  and the features and functionality of our hardware and software products 
there are a number of established  well financed companies producing gaming devices  game content and systems that compete with our products 
certain of these competitors may have access to greater capital resources than we do  and as a result  may be better positioned to compete in the marketplace 
the market is crowded  with igt  wms  aristocrat and konami comprising the primary competition 
pricing  accuracy  reliability  product features and functions are among the factors affecting a provider s success in selling its system 
competition in the gaming industry is intense due to the number of providers  as well as the limited number of casino operators and jurisdictions in which they operate 
as a result of consolidation among the casino operators and the recent cutbacks in spending by casino operators due to the downturn in the economy  the level of competition among providers has increased significantly as the number of potential customers has decreased 
casino operations principal competitive factors in the casino industry are the stature  age and location of the facility  the nature  variety and quality of the amenities and customer services offered  and the continuous development  implementation and success of a variety of marketing programs 
our rainbow casino in vicksburg  mississippi  faces intense direct competition from other gaming facilities serving the vicksburg market and  to a lesser degree  indirect competition from those serving the gulf coast region 
new casinos or expansion projects may be constructed in the vicksburg market in the future which will result in increased competition 
as the overall size of the potential customer base for the vicksburg market is limited  we also face competition from casinos in nearby locations 
these properties may further dilute the market from which we and the other vicksburg casinos draw most of our patrons 
some of these sites may also be closer to larger population centers and  if developed  may enjoy a competitive advantage over our casino 
consumer spending on leisure activities is affected by changes in the economy and consumer tastes  as well as other factors that are difficult to predict and beyond our control 
decreases in consumer spending adversely affecting the casino industry could harm our business 
the demand for entertainment and leisure activities tends to be highly sensitive to consumers disposable incomes  and thus can be affected by changes in the economy and consumer tastes  both of which are difficult to predict and beyond our control 
unfavorable changes in general economic conditions including recession  economic slowdown  or higher fuel or other transportation costs  may reduce disposable income of casino patrons or result in fewer patrons visiting casinos 
as a result  we cannot ensure that demand for our products or services will remain constant 
continued adverse developments affecting economies throughout the world  including a general tightening of the availability of credit  increasing interest rates  increasing energy costs  acts of war or terrorism  natural disasters  declining consumer confidence or additional significant declines in the stock market  as well as concerns regarding epidemics and the spread of contagious diseases  could lead to a further reduction in discretionary spending on leisure activities such as gambling 
any significant or prolonged decrease in consumer spending on leisure activities could greatly affect the casino industry  causing some or all of our customers to decrease spending or ultimately declare bankruptcy  each of which would adversely affect our business 
to the extent there is a change in ownership of any of our customers or there is consolidation within the casino industry  our business could be negatively impacted 
we are heavily dependent on the casino industry 
demand for our products is primarily driven by the replacement of existing products as well as the expansion of existing casinos and the opening of new properties in existing and new jurisdictions 
because a significant portion of our sales come from repeat customers  to the extent the industry consolidates or one of our customers is sold to or merges with another entity that utilizes the products and services of one of our competitors or that reduces spending on our products or causes downward pricing pressures  our business could be negatively impacted 
business combinations of this nature could lead to a cancellation of orders  slow the replacement cycle or negatively impact pricing and purchasing decisions 
also  to the extent some or all of this consolidation is undone resulting in a greater number of smaller  independently run operations that are not as well funded  the replacement cycle could be further slowed and future orders could be reduced 
events within the industry leading or contributing to a decline in demand for our product could adversely affect our business 
our failure to maintain controls and processes related to billing and collecting accounts receivable or the deterioration of the financial condition of our customers could negatively impact our business 
we have offered extended payment terms to certain customers 
as a result  the collection of accounts receivable has become a matter of greater significance 
while we believe the increased level of these specific receivables has allowed us to grow our business  it has also required direct  additional focus of and involvement by management 
further  and especially due to the current downturn in the economy  some of our customers may not pay accounts receivable when due  whether as a result of financial difficulties  bankruptcy or otherwise  resulting in increased write offs for us 
unfavorable political developments  weak foreign economies and other foreign risks may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
our business is dependent on international markets for a portion of our revenues 
as of june   bally gaming and systems had approximately million of net receivables  or of our total net receivables  from customers in foreign countries 
we expect that receivables with respect to foreign sales will continue to account for a portion of our total revenues 
as a result  our business in these markets is subject to a variety of risks  including recessions in foreign economies  expropriation  nationalization and limitation on repatriation of earnings  currency exchange fluctuations  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in managing foreign operations  social  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  ability to finance foreign operations  changes in consumer tastes and trends  tariffs and other trade barriers  acts of war or terrorism  and us government requirements for export 
there can be no assurances that any of these international developments  or others  would not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to attract or retain the management or employees necessary to remain competitive in our industry 
the competition for qualified personnel in the gaming industry is intense 
our future success depends on the retention and continued contributions of our key management  finance  marketing  development and staff personnel  many of whom would be difficult or impossible to replace 
our success is also tied to our ability to recruit additional key personnel in the future 
we may not be able to retain our current personnel or recruit any additional key personnel required 
the loss of services of any of our personnel or our inability to recruit additional necessary key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
the gaming industry is heavily regulated and changes in regulation by gaming authorities may adversely impact our ability to operate in our existing markets or expand our business 
the manufacture and distribution of gaming devices  development of systems and the conduct of gaming operations are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign regulation by various gaming authorities 
our ability to continue to operate in certain jurisdictions or our ability to expand into new jurisdictions could be adversely affected by delays in adopting legislation to permit or expand gaming in new and existing jurisdictions  unfavorable public referendums  such as referendums to increase taxes on gaming revenues  unfavorable legislation affecting or directed at manufacturers or gaming operators  adverse changes in or findings of non compliance with applicable governmental gaming regulations  delays in approvals from regulatory agencies  a limitation  conditioning  suspension or revocation of any of our gaming licenses  unfavorable determinations or challenges of suitability by gaming regulatory authorities with respect to our officers  directors  major stockholders or key personnel  and the adoption of new laws and regulations  or the repeal or amendment of existing laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  internet gaming 
public opinion can also exert a significant influence over the regulation of the gaming industry 
a negative shift in the public s perception of gaming  whether in individual jurisdictions or on a more general level  could affect future legislation 
among other things  such a shift could cause jurisdictions considering the legalization of gaming to abandon such a proposal  thereby limiting the number of new jurisdictions into which we could expand 
negative public perception could also lead to the implementation of new restrictions in jurisdictions in which we currently operate  thereby adversely affecting our operations 
although the laws  rules and regulations of the various jurisdictions in which we operate vary in their technical requirements  virtually all jurisdictions  including those into which we may expand in the future  require licenses  permits  qualification documentation  including evidence of integrity and financial stability  and other forms of approval to engage in gaming operations or the manufacture and distribution of gaming devices 
our officers  directors  major stockholders and key personnel are also subject to significant regulatory scrutiny 
in the event that gaming or governmental authorities determine that any person is unsuitable to act in such capacity with respect to bally  we could be required to terminate our relationship with such person 
to our knowledge  we and our key personnel have obtained  or applied for  all government licenses  registrations  findings of suitability  permits and approvals necessary to conduct our activities in the various jurisdictions that we operate 
however  there can be no assurance those licenses  registrations  findings of suitability  permits or approvals will be renewed in the future  or that new forms of approval necessary to operate in emerging or existing markets will be granted 
our intellectual property protections may be insufficient to properly safeguard our technology 
the gaming industry is constantly employing new technologies in both new and existing markets 
we rely on a combination of patent and other technical security measures to protect our products  and continue to apply for patents protecting such technologies 
notwithstanding these safeguards  our competitors may still be able to obtain our technology or imitate our products 
furthermore  others may independently develop products similar or superior to ours 
we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement or invalidity 
expenses incurred with respect to monitoring  protecting and defending our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 
competitors and other third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights  or may allege that we have infringed on their rights 
monitoring infringement and misappropriation of intellectual property can be difficult and expensive  and we may not be able to detect infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights 
we may also incur significant litigation expenses protecting our intellectual property or defending our use of intellectual property  reducing our ability to fund product initiatives 
these expenses could have an adverse effect on our future cash flows and results of operations 
we are currently subject to litigation regarding patent infringement which  if resolved adversely to us  could have a material impact on our business 
if we are found to infringe on the rights of others we could be required to discontinue offering certain products or systems  to pay damages  or purchase a license to use the intellectual property in question from its owner 
litigation can also distract management from the day to day operations of the business 
there can be no assurances that certain of our products  including those with currently pending patent applications  will not be determined to have infringed upon an existing third party patent 
the intellectual property rights of others may prevent us from developing new products or entering new markets 
the gaming industry is characterized by the rapid development of new technologies  which requires us to continuously introduce new products using these technologies and innovations  as well as to expand into new markets that may be created 
therefore  our success depends in part on our ability to continually adapt our products and systems to incorporate new technologies and to expand into markets that may be created by new technologies 
however  to the extent technologies are protected by the intellectual property rights of others  including our competitors  we may be prevented from introducing products based on these technologies or expanding into markets created by these technologies 
if the intellectual property rights of others prevent us from taking advantage of innovative technologies  our financial condition  operating results or prospects may be harmed 
our gaming operations  particularly our wide area progressive networks and centrally determined systems  may experience losses due to technical difficulties or fraudulent activities 
our success depends on our ability to avoid  detect  replicate and correct software and hardware errors and fraudulent manipulation of our products and systems 
to the extent any of our gaming devices or software experience errors or fraudulent manipulation  our customers may replace our products and services with those of our competitors 
in addition  the occurrence of errors in  or fraudulent manipulation of  our gaming devices or software may give rise to claims for lost revenues and related litigation by our customers and may subject us to investigation or other action by gaming regulatory authorities  including suspension or revocation of our gaming licenses or disciplinary action 
additionally  in the event of such issues with our gaming devices or software  substantial engineering and marketing resources may be diverted from other areas to rectify the problem 
our bank loan agreement imposes significant restrictions 
failure to comply with these restrictions could result in the acceleration of a substantial portion of our debt  which we may not be able to repay or refinance 
our bank loan agreement contains a number of covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability and certain of our subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make other distributions  enter into certain acquisitions  repurchase equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  issue or sell equity interests of our subsidiaries  and engage in mergers or consolidations or certain other transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates 
in addition  our bank loan agreement requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios 
our ability to comply with such financial ratios  meet our debt service obligations or reduce our total debt is dependent upon our future performance  which may be affected by events beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with such restrictions and limitations  or that they will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs  or engage in other business activities that would otherwise be in our interest 
a breach of any of our covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios under the bank loan agreement or under any replacement loan agreement could result in a default under such loan agreement 
in the event of any such default  the lenders could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding under such loan agreement  together with any accrued interest and other fees  to be due and payable  as well as require us to apply all available cash to repay the amounts 
if we were unable to repay the indebtedness upon its acceleration  the lenders could proceed against the underlying collateral 
there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay the amount in full  that we would be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the indebtedness or that we would be able to obtain a waiver to cure the default 
current borrowings  as well as potential future financings  may substantially increase our current indebtedness 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to generate the cash flows necessary to permit us to meet our fixed charges and payment obligations with respect to our debt 
we could be required to incur additional indebtedness to meet these fixed charges and payment obligations 
should we incur additional debt  among other things  such increased indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to expand our business  market our products and make investments and capital expenditures  adversely affect the cost and availability of funds from commercial lenders  debt financing transactions and other sources  and create competitive disadvantages compared to other companies with lower debt levels 
any inability to service our fixed charges and payment obligations  or the incurrence of additional debt  would have an adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations and business generally 
an inability to maintain sufficient liquidity could negatively affect expected levels of operations and new product development 
future revenue may not be sufficient to meet operating  product development and other cash flow requirements 
sufficient funds to service our debt and maintain new product development efforts and expected levels of operations may not be available  and additional capital  if and when needed by us  may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms when needed  we may not be able to carry out our planned product development efforts and level of operations  which could harm our business 
our financial results vary from quarter to quarter  which could negatively impact our business 
various factors affect our quarterly operating results  some of which are not within our control 
these factors include  among others the financial strength of the gaming industry  consumers willingness to spend money on leisure activities  the timing and introduction of new products and services  the mix of products and services sold  the timing of significant orders from and shipments to customers  product and service pricing and discounts  the timing of acquisitions of other companies and businesses or dispositions  and general economic conditions 
these and other factors are likely to cause our financial results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
based on the foregoing  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful 
in addition  such fluctuations could cause us to be unable to comply with the financial ratios in our bank loan agreement 
the provisions in our restated articles of incorporation and nevada law could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of our company that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for our common stock 
our restated articles of incorporation permit our board of directors to issue special shares from time to time  with such rights and preferences as they consider appropriate 
our board of directors could authorize the issuance of special shares with terms and conditions and under circumstances that could have an effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction 
as a nevada corporation  we are also subject to certain provisions of the nevada general corporation law that have anti takeover effects and may inhibit a non negotiated merger or other business combination 
these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with  and to obtain the approval of  our board of directors in connection with such a transaction 
however  certain of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of bally  including an acquisition in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
as a result  stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so
