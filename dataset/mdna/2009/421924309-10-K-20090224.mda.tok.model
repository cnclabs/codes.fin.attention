item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which highlight additional considerations about healthsouth 
we are the nation s largest provider of inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services in terms of revenues  number of hospitals  and patients treated and discharged 
we operate inpatient rehabilitation hospitals including joint venture hospitals which we account for using the equity method of accounting  freestanding long term acute care hospitals  or ltchs  outpatient rehabilitation satellites operated by our hospitals  and licensed  hospital based home health agencies 
our consolidated net operating revenues approximated billion  billion  and billion for the years ended december    and  respectively 
for  approximately of our net operating revenues came from inpatient services and approximately came from outpatient services and other revenue sources see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
during  we treated and discharged over  patients in our rehabilitation hospitals 
we had approximately  employees as of december  our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals offer specialized rehabilitative care across a wide array of diagnoses and deliver comprehensive patient care services 
the majority of patients we serve experience significant physical disabilities due to medical conditions  such as strokes  hip fractures  head injury  spinal cord injury  and neurological disorders  that are non discretionary in nature and which require rehabilitative services in an inpatient setting 
our team of highly skilled physicians  nurses  and physical  occupational  and speech therapists utilize the latest in equipment and techniques to return patients to home and work 
patient care is provided by nursing and therapy staff as directed by a physician order 
internal case managers monitor each patient s progress and provide documentation of patient status  achievement of goals  discharge planning  and functional outcomes 
our hospitals provide a comprehensive interdisciplinary clinical approach to treatment that leads to what we believe is a higher level of care and superior outcomes 
our outpatient rehabilitation facilities offer a range of rehabilitative healthcare services  including physical  occupational  and speech therapies treating a broad range of neurological and orthopedic conditions 
ltchs provide medical treatment to patients with chronic diseases and or complex medical conditions 
in order for a hospital to qualify as an ltch  medicare patients discharged from the hospital in any given cost reporting year must have an average length of stay in excess of days 
as of december   our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and ltchs had  licensed beds 
our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals are located in states and puerto rico  with a concentration of hospitals in texas  pennsylvania  florida  tennessee  and alabama 
in addition to healthsouth hospitals and outpatient satellites  we manage eight inpatient rehabilitation units and one outpatient satellite through management contracts 
as the nation s largest provider of inpatient rehabilitative services and with our business focused primarily on those services  we believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors in the following ways quality 
our hospitals provide a broad base of clinical experience from which we have developed clinical best practices and protocols 
we believe these clinical best practices and protocols help ensure the delivery of consistently high quality rehabilitative services across all of our hospitals 
technology 
as a market leader in inpatient rehabilitation  we have devoted substantial effort and expertise to creating and leveraging rehabilitative technology 
for example  we have developed an innovative therapeutic device called the autoambulator  which can help advance the rehabilitative process for patients who experience difficulty walking 
technology instituted in our facilities allows us to effectively treat patients with a wide variety of significant physical disabilities 
efficiency and cost effectiveness 
our size helps us provide inpatient rehabilitative services on a cost effective basis 
specifically  because of our large number of inpatient hospitals  we can utilize proven staffing models and take advantage of certain supply chain efficiencies 
we have also developed a program called teamworks  which is an operations focused initiative using identified best practices to reduce inefficiencies and improve performance across a wide spectrum of operational areas 
we entered seeking disciplined growth opportunities for our inpatient rehabilitation business within the context of our primary emphasis on debt reduction and further deleveraging 
during the year  we commenced or completed the following development projects in june  a certificate of need was approved that will enable us to establish up to a bed comprehensive medical rehabilitation hospital in marion county  florida 
the certificate of need has been contested by two competitors in the market and is progressing through the normal florida certificate of need appeals process 
the appeals process is expected to take at least one year  and there can be no assurance regarding the timing or outcome 
in july  we purchased the rehabilitation hospital of south jersey  a bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in vineland  new jersey 
this transaction added a third new jersey rehabilitation hospital to our northeast region 
our certificate of need application for a new bed rehabilitation hospital in loudoun county  virginia was approved on july  we expect to break ground on this site in the first half of in august  we acquired an inpatient rehabilitation unit at the medical center of arlington in texas 
the operations of this unit were relocated to  and consolidated with  healthsouth rehabilitation hospital of arlington 
in august  we acquired an inpatient rehabilitation hospital in midland  texas from rehabcare corporation 
the operations of this hospital were relocated to  and consolidated with  healthsouth rehabilitation hospital of midland odessa 
in october  we broke ground on a new  bed freestanding inpatient rehabilitation hospital in mesa  arizona  and we expect operations to commence in the third quarter of as the year progressed and the general economy and credit market weakened further  we began to place even greater emphasis on debt reduction and deleveraging 
we reduced our total debt outstanding by approximately million in see the leverage and liquidity section below for additional discussion of our deleveraging efforts 
we will continue to focus on debt reduction while enhancing the operations of our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and growing our inpatient rehabilitation business through bed expansions and other disciplined development opportunities that require minimal initial cash outlays  such as consolidations in existing markets through joint venturing or acquisition and de novo projects with third party financing 
once we reduce our leverage and have a balance sheet capable of withstanding additional risk  we will consider growth opportunities in other post acute services complementary to our existing services such as long term acute care  home health  and hospice 
as of december   we employed approximately  individuals  of whom approximately  were full time employees 
we are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate wages  hours  benefits  and other terms and conditions relating to employment 
except for approximately employees at one inpatient rehabilitation hospital about of that hospital s workforce  none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we are not aware of any current activities to organize our employees at other hospitals 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
like most healthcare providers  our labor costs are rising faster than the general inflation rate 
in some markets  the lack of availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has become a significant operating issue to healthcare providers 
to address this challenge  we will continue to focus on improving our retention  recruiting  compensation programs  and productivity 
the shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel  including physical therapists  may require us to increase utilization of more expensive temporary personnel 
competition the inpatient rehabilitation industry is highly fragmented  and we have no single  similar direct competitor 
our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals compete primarily with rehabilitation units  many of which are acute care hospitals  and skilled nursing facilities in the markets we serve 
our ltchs compete with other ltchs or  in some cases  rehabilitation hospitals and skilled nursing facilities in the markets we serve 
several smaller privately held companies are beginning to compete with us primarily in select geographic markets in texas and the west 
in addition  there are public companies that operate inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and ltchs  but these are generally secondary services to their core businesses 
because of the attractiveness of the industry  other providers of post acute care services may also become competitors in the future 
for example  over the past few years  the number of nursing homes marketing themselves as rehabilitation providers has increased 
in some states where we operate  the construction or expansion of facilities  the acquisition of existing facilities  or the introduction of new beds or services may be subject to review by and prior approval of state regulatory agencies under a certificate of need or con program 
see the regulation certificates of need section below 
we potentially face opposition any time we initiate a certificate of need project or seek to acquire an existing facility or certificate of need 
this opposition may arise either from competing national or regional companies or from local hospitals or other providers which file competing applications or oppose the proposed certificate of need project 
the necessity for these approvals serves as a barrier to entry and has the potential to limit competition 
we have generally been successful in obtaining certificates of need or similar approvals when required  although there can be no assurance we will achieve similar success in the future 
we rely significantly on our ability to attract  develop  and retain nurses  therapists  and other clinical personnel for our hospitals 
we compete for these professionals with other healthcare companies  hospitals  and potential clients and partners 
in addition  physicians and others have opened inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in direct competition with us  particularly in states in which a con is not required to build a hospital  which has made it more difficult and expensive to hire the necessary personnel for our hospitals in those markets 
sources of revenues we receive payment for patient care services from the federal government primarily under the medicare program  state governments under their respective medicaid or similar programs  managed care plans  private insurers  and directly from patients 
revenues and receivables from government agencies are significant to our operations 
in addition  we receive payment for non patient care activities from various sources 
the following table identifies the sources and relative mix of our revenues for the periods stated for the year ended december  medicare medicaid workers compensation managed care and other discount plans other third party payors patients other income total our hospitals generally offer discounts from established charges to certain group purchasers of healthcare services  including blue cross and blue shield  or bcbs  other private insurance companies  employers  health maintenance organizations  or hmos  preferred provider organizations  or ppos  and other managed care plans 
patients are generally not responsible for the difference between established gross charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under medicare  medicaid  bcbs plans  hmos  or ppos  but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions  deductibles  copayments  or coinsurance features of their coverage 
the amount of such exclusions  deductibles  copayments  and coinsurance has been increasing each year 
collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or third party payors 
medicare reimbursement medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged and over  some disabled persons  and persons with end stage renal disease 
medicare  through statutes and regulations  establishes reimbursement methodologies and rates for various types of healthcare facilities and services  and  from time to time  these methodologies and rates can be modified by the united states congress or the united states centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
in some instances  these modifications can have a substantial impact on existing healthcare providers 
in accordance with medicare laws and statutes  cms makes annual adjustments to medicare payment rates in many prospective payment systems  including the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system  or irf pps  under what is commonly known as a market basket increase 
in the case of the irf pps  unless congress changes the law  cms is required to adjust the payment rates based on a market basket index  known as the rehabilitation  psychiatric  and long term care hospital  or rpl  market basket 
the rpl is designed to reflect changes over time in the prices of an appropriate mix of goods and services included in covered services provided by rehabilitation hospitals and hospital based inpatient rehabilitation units 
the rpl uses data furnished by the bureau of labor statistics for price proxy purposes  primarily in three categories producer price indexes  consumer price indexes  and employment cost indexes 
the medicare  medicaid and state children s health insurance program schip extension act of the medicare act included an elimination of the irf pps market basket adjustment for the period from april  through september  causing a reduction in the pricing of services eligible for medicare reimbursement to a pricing level that existed in the third quarter of  or a medicare pricing roll back  which has resulted in a decrease in actual reimbursement dollars per discharge despite increases in costs 
each year  the medicare payment advisory commission  or medpac  makes payment policy recommendations to congress for a variety of medicare payment systems 
medpac is an independent congressional agency that advises congress on issues affecting medicare 
in january  medpac voted to recommend to congress that the irf pps market basket for the twelve month period beginning october  should not be increased 
medpac recommended an increase to the market basket for ltchs  with an adjustment for productivity 
however  congress is not obligated to adopt medpac recommendations  and  based on outcomes in previous years  we have no indication of whether congress will adopt medpac s recommendations for the twelve month period beginning october  we cannot predict the adjustments  if any  to medicare payment rates that congress or cms may make 
congress  medpac  and cms will continue to address reimbursement rates for a variety of healthcare settings over the next several years 
any downward adjustment to rates  or continuance of the pricing roll back  for the types of facilities we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
on january   cms approved final rules that require healthcare providers to update and supplement diagnosis and procedure codes to the international classification of diseases th edition  effective october   and make related changes to the formats used for certain electronic transactions  effective january  at this time  we cannot predict how these changes will affect us 
a basic summary of current medicare reimbursement in our primary service areas follows inpatient rehabilitation services 
our hospitals receive medicare reimbursements under irf pps 
as discussed above  our hospitals receive fixed payment amounts per discharge under irf pps based on certain rehabilitation impairment categories established by the united states department of health and human services 
with irf pps  our hospitals retain the difference  if any  between the fixed payment from medicare and their operating costs 
thus  our hospitals benefit from being high quality  low cost providers 
over the last several years  changes in regulation governing inpatient rehabilitation reimbursement have created a challenging operating environment for inpatient rehabilitative services 
specifically  on may   cms issued a final rule  known as the rule  stipulating that to qualify as an inpatient rehabilitation hospital under the medicare program a facility must show that a certain percentage of its patients are treated for at least one of a specified and limited list of medical conditions 
under the rule  any inpatient rehabilitation hospital that failed to meet the requirements of the rule would be subject to prospective reclassification as an acute care hospital  with lower acute care payment rates for rehabilitative services 
on december   the medicare act was signed  permanently setting the compliance threshold at instead of and allowing hospitals to continue using a patient s secondary medical conditions  or comorbidities  to determine whether a patient qualifies for inpatient rehabilitative care under the rule 
the long term impact of the freeze at the compliance threshold is positive because it allowed patient volumes to stabilize 
in  increased patient volumes resulting  we believe  from both our focus on standardizing sales and marketing efforts and the fact that more patients now have access to our high quality inpatient rehabilitative services offset the negative impact of the pricing roll back 
we expect the negative impact of the pricing roll back to continue to be offset partially by our volume increases 
there can be no assurance there will be an increase in medicare reimbursement pricing upon the expiration of the roll back period 
although reductions or changes in reimbursement from governmental or third party payors and regulatory changes affecting our business represent the most significant challenges to our business  our operations are also affected by local coverage determinations made by local medicare contractors that set out medical necessity requirements for claim coverage 
medicare providers like us can be negatively affected by the adoption of coverage policies  either at the national or local level  that determine whether an item or service is covered and under what clinical circumstances it is considered to be reasonable  necessary  and appropriate 
in the absence of a national coverage determination  local medicare contractors may specify more restrictive criteria than otherwise would apply nationally 
we cannot predict how these local coverage determinations will affect us 
in addition  on july   cms released the fiscal year notice of final rulemaking for irf pps 
this rule will be effective for medicare discharges between october  and september  based on our analysis  we do not believe this final rule will negatively impact our net operating revenues 
on december   the medicare modernization act of authorized cms to conduct a demonstration program known as the medicare recovery audit contractor  or rac  program 
this demonstration was first initiated in three states california  florida  and new york and authorizes cms to contract with private companies to conduct claims and medical record audits 
these audits are in addition to those conducted by existing medicare contractors  and the contracted racs are paid a percentage of the overpayments recovered 
on december   the tax relief health care act of directed cms to expand the rac program to the rest of the country by the new racs were announced on october  and cms is in the process of implementing the program 
among other changes in the permanent program  the new racs will receive claims data directly from medicare contractors on a monthly or quarterly basis and are authorized to review claims up to three years from the date a claim was paid  beginning with claims filed on or after october  we cannot predict when or how this new program will affect us 
outpatient services 
our outpatient services are primarily reimbursed based upon the physician fee schedule 
on november   cms issued a final rule that updated payments under the physician fee schedule from january  through december  in accordance with language provided for in the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of that superseded a previously adopted annual reduction  the rule increased the standard conversion factor by to 
we estimate that these changes will result in modestly higher reimbursement to us for outpatient services 
in the future  if congress does not again act to set aside implementation of previously adopted reductions to the physician fee schedule  the outpatient payment formula will decrease by approximately 
we cannot predict what  if any  action congress will take on the physician fee schedule in the future  and we cannot predict how future congressional action or inaction on the physician fee schedule will affect us 
long term acute care hospitals 
ltchs provide medical treatment to patients with chronic diseases and or complex medical conditions 
in order for a hospital to qualify as an ltch  medicare patients discharged from the hospital in any given cost reporting year must have an average length of stay in excess of days  among other requirements 
ltchs are currently reimbursed under a prospective payment system ltch pps pursuant to which medicare classifies patients into distinct medicare severity diagnosis related groups ms ltc drgs based upon specific clinical characteristics and expected resource needs 
the medicare act provides regulatory relief for a three year period to ltchs to ensure continued access to current long term acute care hospital services  while also imposing a moratorium on the development of new long term acute care hospitals during this same three year period 
specifically  the legislation froze the market basket update for medicare payment rates for ltchs in the last quarter of rate year additionally  the medicare act prevented cms from implementing the new payment provision for short stay outlier cases and the extension of the referral limitation to freestanding  satellite  and grandfathered ltchs that was included in the rate year final rule 
see this item  regulation hospital within hospital rules for a further discussion of this rule 
on may   cms issued final regulations that updated payment rates under the ltch pps for rate year  which are effective for discharges occurring on or after july  through september  this rule implements various payment changes and will consolidate the timing of the rate year changes with the ms ltc drg changes beginning on october  this final rule did not materially impact our net operating revenues in  nor is it expected to materially impact our net operating revenues 
on august   cms issued final regulations that updated the ltch pps 
the final rule made changes to the ltch relative payment weights and average lengths of stay 
these changes were effective beginning october  this final rule is not expected to have a material impact on our net operating revenues during federal fiscal year in january  medpac recommended an increase to the market basket for ltchs for the twelve month period beginning october   with an adjustment for productivity 
medicaid reimbursement medicaid is a jointly administered and funded federal and state program that provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford healthcare 
as the medicaid program is administered by the individual states under the oversight of cms in accordance with certain regulatory and statutory guidelines  there are substantial differences in reimbursement methodologies and coverage policies from state to state 
many states have experienced shortfalls in their medicaid budgets and are implementing significant cuts in medicaid reimbursement rates 
additionally  certain states control medicaid expenditures through restricting or eliminating coverage of certain services 
continuing downward pressure on medicaid payment rates could cause a decline in that portion of our net operating revenues 
cost reports because of our participation in medicare  medicaid  and certain bcbs plans  we are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements 
federal and  where applicable  state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenue  costs  and expenses associated with the services provided by our inpatient hospitals to medicare beneficiaries and medicaid recipients 
annual cost reports required under the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to routine audits  which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due healthsouth under these reimbursement programs 
these audits are used for determining if any under or over payments were made to these programs and to set payment levels for future years 
the majority of our revenues are derived from prospective payment system payments  and even if we amend previously filed cost reports we do not expect the impact of those amendments to materially affect our results of operations 
managed care and other discount plans all of our hospitals offer discounts from established charges to certain large group purchasers of healthcare services  including managed care plans  bcbs  other private insurance companies  and third party administrators 
managed care contracts typically have terms of between one and three years  although we have a number of managed care contracts that automatically renew each year with pre defined rate increases unless a party elects to terminate the contract 
while some of our contracts provide for annual rate increases of three to five percent  we cannot provide any assurance we will continue to receive increases 
our managed care staff focuses on establishing and re negotiating contracts that provide equitable reimbursement for the services provided 
regulation the healthcare industry in general is subject to significant federal  state  and local regulation that affects our business activities by controlling the reimbursement we receive for services provided  requiring licensure or certification of our hospitals  regulating our relationships with physicians and other referral sources  regulating the use of our properties  and controlling our growth 
our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals provide services to patients who require intensive inpatient rehabilitative care for significant physical disabilities due to various conditions  such as head injury  spinal cord injury  stroke  certain orthopedic problems  and neuromuscular disease 
our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals provide the medical  nursing  therapy  and ancillary services required to comply with local  state  and federal regulations  as well as accreditation standards of the joint commission formerly known as the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations and  for some facilities  the commission on accreditation of rehabilitation facilities 
corporate integrity agreement on december   we entered into a corporate integrity agreement  or cia  with the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services the hhs oig  and we have subsequently entered into two addenda to the cia 
the cia has an effective date of january  and a term of five years same for the addenda from that effective date 
the cia expires at the end of  subject to the hhs oig accepting and approving our annual report for that we will submit in the first half of the cia sets forth a comprehensive compliance program that we are required to follow 
for additional information  see note  settlements  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the cia requires us to submit annual reports to the hhs oig regarding our compliance with the cia 
the cia also requires us to engage an independent review organization iro to assist us in assessing and evaluating our billing  coding  and cost reporting practices with respect to our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals  our billing and coding practices for outpatient items and services furnished by outpatient departments of our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals  and certain other obligations pursuant to the cia and the related settlement agreement 
we engaged pricewaterhousecoopers llp to serve as our iro 
we believe we have complied with the requirements of the cia on a timely basis  and to date  there are no objections or unresolved comments from the hhs oig relating to our annual reports 
failure to meet our obligations under our cia could result in stipulated financial penalties or extension of the term of the cia 
failure to comply with material terms  however  could lead to exclusion from further participation in federal healthcare programs  including medicare and medicaid  which currently account for a substantial portion of our revenues 
licensure and certification healthcare facility construction and operation are subject to numerous federal  state  and local regulations relating to the adequacy of medical care  equipment  personnel  operating policies and procedures  acquisition and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances  maintenance of adequate records  fire prevention  and compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws 
our hospitals are subject to periodic inspection by governmental and non governmental certification authorities to ensure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for facility licensure 
all of our inpatient hospitals are currently required to be licensed 
in addition  hospitals must be certified by cms to participate in the medicare program and generally must be certified by medicaid state agencies to participate in medicaid programs 
all of our inpatient hospitals participate in or are awaiting the assignment of a provider number to participate in the medicare program 
our medicare certified hospitals undergo periodic on site surveys in order to maintain their certification 
failure to comply with applicable certification requirements may make our hospitals ineligible for medicare or medicaid reimbursement 
in addition  medicare or medicaid may seek retroactive reimbursement from noncompliant facilities or otherwise impose sanctions on noncompliant facilities 
non governmental payors often have the right to terminate provider contracts if a facility loses its medicare or medicaid certification 
we have developed operational systems to oversee compliance with the various standards and requirements of the medicare program and have established ongoing quality assurance activities  however  given the complex nature of governmental healthcare regulations  there can be no assurance that medicare  medicaid  or other regulatory authorities will not allege instances of noncompliance 
certificates of need in some states where we operate  the construction or expansion of facilities  the acquisition of existing facilities  or the introduction of new beds or services may be subject to review by and prior approval of state regulatory agencies under certificate of need laws 
certificate of need laws often require the reviewing agency to determine the public need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities and services 
certificate of need laws generally require approvals for capital expenditures involving inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and ltchs  if such capital expenditures exceed certain thresholds 
in addition  certificate of need laws in some states require us to abide by certain charity commitments as a condition for approving a certificate of need 
any time a certificate of need is required  we must obtain it before acquiring  opening  reclassifying  or expanding a healthcare facility or starting a new healthcare program 
false claims act the federal false claims act prohibits the knowing presentation of a false claim to the united states government  and provides for penalties equal to three times the actual amount of any overpayments plus up to  per claim 
in addition  the false claims act allows private persons  known as relators  to file complaints under seal and provides a period of time for the government to investigate such complaints and determine whether to intervene in them and take over the handling of all or part of such complaints 
because we perform thousands of similar procedures a year for which we are reimbursed by medicare and other federal payors and there is a relatively long statute of limitations  a billing error or cost reporting error could result in significant civil or criminal penalties under the false claims act 
many states have also adopted similar laws relating to state government payments for healthcare services 
relationships with physicians and other providers the anti kickback law 
various state and federal laws regulate relationships between providers of healthcare services  including employment or service contracts and investment relationships 
among the most important of these restrictions is a federal criminal law  or the anti kickback law  prohibiting the offer  payment  solicitation  or receipt of remuneration by individuals or entities to induce referrals of patients for services reimbursed under the medicare or medicaid programs 
in addition to federal criminal sanctions  including penalties of up to  for each violation plus tripled damages for improper claims  violators of the anti kickback law may be subject to exclusion from the medicare and or medicaid programs 
in  the hhs oig issued regulations describing compensation arrangements that are not viewed as illegal remuneration under the anti kickback law the safe harbor rules 
the safe harbor rules create certain standards  or safe harbors  for identified types of compensation arrangements that  if fully complied with  assure participants in the particular arrangement that the hhs oig will not treat that participation as a criminal offense under the anti kickback law or as the basis for an exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs or the imposition of civil sanctions 
failure to fall within a safe harbor does not constitute a violation of the anti kickback law  but the hhs oig has indicated failure to fall within a safe harbor may subject an arrangement to increased scrutiny 
a violation  or even the assertion of  a violation of the anti kickback law by us or one or more of our partnerships could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
we currently operate some of our rehabilitation hospitals as general partnerships  limited partnerships  or limited liability companies with third party investors  including other institutional healthcare providers but also including  in one case  physician investors 
some of these partners may be deemed to be in a position to make or influence referrals to our hospitals 
those entities that are providers of services under the medicare program  and their owners  are subject to the anti kickback law 
a number of the relationships we have established with physicians and other healthcare providers do not fit within any of the safe harbors 
while we do not believe our rehabilitation hospital partnerships engage in activities that violate the anti kickback law  there can be no assurance such violations may not be asserted in the future  nor can there be any assurance that our defense against any such assertion would be successful 
we have entered into agreements to manage many of our hospitals that are owned by partnerships 
most of these agreements incorporate a percentage based management fee 
although there is a safe harbor for personal services and management contracts  this safe harbor requires  among other things  the aggregate compensation paid to the manager over the term of the agreement be set in advance 
because our management fee may be based on a percentage of revenues  the fee arrangement may not meet this requirement 
however  we believe our management arrangements satisfy the other requirements of the safe harbor for personal services and management contracts and they comply with the anti kickback law 
we have implemented training and compliance programs designed to safeguard against overbilling and otherwise to achieve compliance with the anti kickback law and other laws  but there can be no assurance the hhs oig would find our compliance programs to be adequate 
stark exceptions 
the federal law commonly known as the stark law and cms regulations promulgated under the stark law prohibit physicians from making referrals for designated health services including inpatient and outpatient hospital services  physical therapy  occupational therapy  radiology services  or radiation therapy  to an entity in which the physician has an investment interest or other financial relationship  subject to certain exceptions 
the stark law also prohibits those entities from filing claims or billing for those referred services 
these prohibitions apply to our financial relationships with physicians and any partnerships with physician partners 
violators of the stark statute and regulations may be subject to recoupments  civil monetary fines  penalties and exclusion from any federal  state  or other governmental healthcare programs 
we have put in place training and compliance programs and policies intended to prevent violations of the stark statute and regulations 
while we do not believe our financial relationships with physicians violate the stark statute or the associated regulations  no assurances can be given that a federal or state agency charged with enforcement of the stark statute and regulations or similar state laws might not assert a contrary position or that new federal or state laws governing physician relationships  or new interpretations of existing laws governing such relationships  might not adversely affect relationships we have established with physicians or result in the imposition of penalties on us or on particular healthsouth hospitals 
even the assertion of a violation could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  a number of states have passed or are considering statutes which prohibit or limit physician referrals of patients to facilities in which they have an investment interest 
any actual or perceived violation of these state statutes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
hipaa the health insurance portability and accountability act of  commonly known as hipaa  broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for healthcare fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs 
hipaa also added a prohibition against incentives intended to influence decisions by medicare beneficiaries as to the provider from which they will receive services 
in addition  hipaa created new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse  including the medicare integrity program  and an incentive program under which individuals can receive up to  for providing information on medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of at least of medicare funds 
hipaa and related hhs regulations contain certain administrative simplification provisions that require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for certain healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically 
hipaa regulations also regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health related information  whether communicated electronically  on paper  or orally 
the regulations provide patients with significant rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used or disclosed and require healthcare providers to implement administrative  physical  and technical practices to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is maintained or transmitted electronically 
penalties for violations of hipaa include civil and criminal monetary penalties 
in addition  there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing patient privacy concerns 
facilities will continue to remain subject to any federal or state privacy related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under hipaa 
these laws vary and could impose additional penalties 
any actual or perceived violation of these privacy related laws  including hipaa could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
we have put in place training and compliance programs and policies intended to prevent violations of hipaa and related regulations 
hospital within hospital rules cms has enacted multiple regulations governing hospital within hospital arrangements for inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and ltchs 
these regulations provide  among other things  that if a long term acute care hospital within hospital has medicare admissions from its host hospital that exceed or an adjusted percentage for certain rural or metropolitan statistical area dominant hospitals of its medicare discharges for its cost reporting period  the ltch will receive an adjusted payment for its medicare patients of the lesser of the otherwise full payment under the ltch pps or a comparable payment that medicare would pay under the acute care inpatient prospective payment system 
in determining whether an ltch meets the criterion  patients transferred from the host hospital that have already qualified for outlier payments at the acute host facility would not count as part of the host hospital s allowable percentage 
cases admitted from the host hospital before the ltch crosses the threshold will be paid under the ltch pps 
additionally  other excluded hospitals or units of a host hospital  such as inpatient rehabilitation facilities and or units  must meet certain hospital within hospital requirements in order to maintain their excluded status and not be subject to the acute care inpatient prospective payment system 
on july   cms regulations extended the referral limitation applicable to hospital within hospital locations to freestanding  satellite  and grandfathered ltchs 
the medicare act modified and delayed implementation of this extension of the rule and certain other portions of the hospital within hospital rules applicable to ltchs for cost report periods beginning on or after december  for a three year period 
these regulations did not materially impact our net operating revenues in  nor are they expected to materially impact our net operating revenues 
we cannot predict when or how these new program policies will affect us 
significant events the unprecedented turmoil and volatility of the equity and credit markets and the corresponding weakening of the economy during  in particular the second half of  led us to reassess our strategic thinking to ensure it was appropriate given the new business climate 
in the third quarter of  we determined that  while we are positioned to do well in a volatile economic environment and have adequate sources of liquidity  we will place greater emphasis on reducing our debt 
as we reassessed the appropriateness of our strategic outlook during the current economic uncertainty  we took a critical look at our development strategy  especially as it related to de novo projects 
in recognition of changing economic conditions  we will continue to be disciplined in our approach to development opportunities  carefully evaluating these opportunities against our deleveraging priority 
for the foreseeable future  reducing our long term debt will be our primary objective 
we will continue to pursue bed expansions in existing hospitals as they provide immediate earnings growth  and we will pursue acquisitions and market consolidations where we can do so with minimal initial cash outlays 
for any de novo project we decide to pursue  we will work with third parties willing to assume the majority of the financing risks associated with these projects 
during the first quarter of  we sold our corporate campus for a purchase price of million in cash and a deferred purchase price component related to a part of the campus see item  properties  below and note  property and equipment  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as part of this transaction  we entered into a long term lease for office space within the property that was sold

under the settlement  million in cash previously paid into escrow by ubs securities and its insurance carriers will be released to us  and we will receive a release of all claims by ubs securities including the release and satisfaction of an approximate million judgment in favor of an affiliate of ubs securities related to a loan guarantee 
out of the million cash settlement proceeds received from ubs securities and its insurance carriers  we are obligated to pay million in fees and expenses to the derivative plaintiffs attorneys  and pursuant to the previously disclosed settlement agreements in the consolidated securities litigation  of the net proceeds  after deducting all of our costs and expenses in connection with the derivative litigation  will be paid to plaintiffs in the consolidated securities litigation 
see note  settlements  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these funds are expected to be dispersed to the applicable parties during the first quarter of we intend to use the majority of our net cash proceeds to reduce long term debt 
in october  we received a total cash refund of approximately million including interest attributable to our settlement with the internal revenue service the irs for tax years through we used the majority of this cash to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit agreement 
see note  long term debt  and note  income taxes  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  we settled federal income tax issues outstanding with the irs for the tax years through  and the joint committee on taxation reviewed and approved the associated income tax refund of approximately million including interest due to the company 
in february  we received the majority of this cash refund and used it to pay down long term debt 
leverage and liquidity our total debt outstanding has decreased from billion as of december  to billion as of december  with the continued deleveraging of the company as a priority  on june   we issued and sold million shares of our common stock to jp morgan securities inc for net proceeds of approximately million see note  shareholders deficit  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and used the majority of these net proceeds to reduce our total debt outstanding 
this debt reduction was in addition to the use of the net proceeds from the sale of our corporate campus see note  property and equipment  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in april to reduce total debt outstanding 
we also used the majority of our federal income tax refund received in october see note  income taxes  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit agreement 
our long term debt excluding notes payable to banks and others and capital lease obligations as of december  and is summarized in the following table as of december  as of december  in millions revolving credit facility term loan facility bonds payable total long term debt as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
this amount excludes approximately million in restricted cash and million of restricted marketable securities 
as of december   restricted cash included approximately million related to our settlement with ubs securities see note  settlements  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
this amount was transferred to us in december  with an additional million related to this settlement transferred to us in january  from ubs securities and its insurance carriers and held in escrow pending the court s implementation of the final court order entered on january  these funds are expected to be dispersed to the applicable parties during the first quarter of we intend to use the majority of our net cash proceeds from this settlement see above discussion related to amounts owed to the derivative plaintiffs attorneys and the plaintiffs in the consolidated securities litigation to reduce long term debt outstanding 
the remainder of our restricted cash pertains to various obligations we have under lending agreements  partnership agreements  and other arrangements primarily related to our captive insurance company 
in light of the current downturn in the global economy  we have evaluated  to the extent practicable  our exposure to financial services counterparties to whom we have material exposure 
we monitor the financial strength of our depositories  creditors  derivative counterparties  and insurance carriers using publicly available information  as well as qualitative inputs 
during the fourth quarter of  we made a million draw on the revolving credit facility and issued letters of credit under its subfacility without incident 
the draw was used for general corporate purposes 
based on our current borrowing capacity and compliance with the financial covenants under our credit agreement  we do not believe there is significant risk in our ability to make additional draws under our revolving credit facility  if needed 
however  no such assurances can be provided 
in addition  we do not face substantial near term refinancing risk  as our revolving credit facility does not expire until  our term loan facility as defined in note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements does not mature until  and the majority of our bonds are not due until and we expect our cash flow to allow us to further reduce our debt 
during february  we used our federal income tax refund for tax years through along with available cash to reduce our term loan facility by million and amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility to zero 
as noted above  we intend to use the majority of the net cash proceeds from the ubs settlement to pay down long term debt see note  settlements  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
while our focus in will be to pay down debt  we intend to direct a portion of our excess cash flow into our development activities  focusing on bed additions at our existing hospitals and transactions that require a minimal initial outlay of cash 
for a more detailed discussion of our liquidity  see item a  risk factors  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  and also note  liquidity  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
risk management and insurance we insure a substantial portion of our professional  general liability  and workers compensation risks through a self insured retention program underwritten by our wholly owned offshore captive insurance subsidiary  hcs limited hcs  which we fund via regularly scheduled premium payments 
for  hcs provided our first layer of insurance coverage for professional and general liability risks and workers compensation claims 
we maintained professional and general liability insurance and workers compensation insurance with unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by hcs 
healthsouth and hcs maintained reserves for professional  general liability  and workers compensation risks 
management considers such reserves  which are based on actuarially determined estimates  to be adequate for those liability risks 
however  there can be no assurance the ultimate liability will not exceed management s estimates 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  self insured risks  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of these reserves 
we also maintain director and officer  property  and other typical insurance coverages with unrelated commercial carriers 
our director and officer liability insurance coverage for our current officers and directors includes coverage for individual directors and officers in circumstances where we are legally or financially unable to indemnify these individuals 
examples of a company s inability to indemnify would include judgments in connection with shareholder derivative lawsuits  bankruptcy financial restraints  and claims that are against public policy 
within our coverage  we have a self insured retention for indemnifiable loss

item a 
risk factors our business  operations  and financial position are subject to various risks 
some of these risks are described below  and you should take such risks into account in evaluating healthsouth or any investment decision involving healthsouth 
this section does not describe all risks that may be applicable to our company  our industry  or our business  and it is intended only as a summary of certain material risk factors 
more detailed information concerning the risk factors described below is contained in other sections of this annual report 
we are highly leveraged 
as a consequence  a down turn in earnings could impair our ability to comply with the financial covenants contained within our credit agreement and could impair our ability to obtain additional financing  if necessary 
we continue to make progress in improving our leverage and liquidity 
as discussed in item  business  leverage and liquidity  we reduced our long term debt from billion to approximately billion during these continued reductions in our long term debt improve our financial position  increase our liquidity  and enhance our operational flexibility 
we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt 
a down turn in earnings could impair our ability to comply with the financial covenants contained within our credit agreement and impair our ability to obtain additional financing  if necessary 
if we anticipated a potential covenant violation  we would seek relief from our lenders  which would have some cost to us  and such relief might not be on terms favorable to those in our existing credit agreement 
the recent tightening in the credit markets will make additional financing more expensive and difficult to obtain 
a default due to violation of the covenants contained within our credit agreement could require us to immediately repay all amounts then outstanding under the credit agreement 
in addition  we are subject to numerous contingent liabilities  to prevailing economic conditions  and to financial  business  and other factors beyond our control 
although we expect to make scheduled interest payments and principal reductions  we cannot assure you that changes in our business or other factors will not occur that may have the effect of preventing us from satisfying obligations under our debt 
recent uncertainty in the global credit markets could adversely affect our business and financial condition by making it more challenging for us to carry out our deleveraging and development objectives 
the global credit markets experienced significant disruptions in  which have caused the interest rates on prospective debt financings to increase 
these circumstances have impacted liquidity in the debt markets  and in certain cases have resulted in reductions in the availability of certain types of debt financing  including access to revolving lines of credit 
where financing can be obtained  the terms for borrowers are less attractive 
a prolonged downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly 
we have evaluated  to the extent practicable  our exposure to counterparties who have or may likely experience significant threats to their ability to adequately service our needs 
we monitor the financial strength of our depositories  creditors  derivative counterparties  and insurance carriers using publicly available information  as well as qualitative service experience inputs 
we are generally confident that we will have access to our revolving credit facility 
during the fourth quarter of  we made a million draw on our revolving credit facility and issued letters of credit under its subfacility without incident 
the draw was used for general corporate purposes 
based on the current borrowing capacity and leverage ratio required under our credit agreement  we do not believe there is significant risk in our ability to make additional draws under our revolving credit facility  if needed 
in addition  we do not face substantial near term refinancing risk  as our revolving credit facility does not expire until  our term loan facility as defined in note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements does not expire until  and the majority of our bonds are not due until and our portfolio of restricted marketable securities has performed as expected in the current economy 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded impairment charges related to our marketable equity securities see note  cash and marketable securities  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we continue to evaluate our portfolio allocation in relation to our investment objectives 
our primary risks relating to current market conditions is the possibility that a rapid increase in interest rates and or a down turn in operating earnings could impair our ability to comply with the financial covenants contained within our credit agreement and that lenders in our credit agreement will be unable to provide liquidity when needed 
loans under our credit agreement bear interest at a rate of  at our option  month  month  month  or month libor or the prime rate  plus an applicable margin that varies depending upon our leverage ratio and corporate credit rating 
our primary covenants include a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio  with the interest coverage ratio being a four consecutive fiscal quarters test 
a default due to violation of the covenants contained within our credit agreement could require us to immediately repay all amounts then outstanding under the credit agreement 
if we anticipated a potential covenant violation  we would seek relief from our lenders  which would have some cost to us  and such relief might not be on terms as favorable to those in our existing credit agreement 
under such circumstances  there is also the potential our lenders would not grant relief to us which  among other things  would depend on the state of the credit markets at that time 
while our variable interest payments increase or decrease in accordance with changes in interest rates  the vast majority of the variation in these payments will be offset by net settlement payments or receipts on our interest rate swap that is not designated as a hedge 
therefore  our cash position is generally protected from such changes 
net settlement payments or receipts on this interest rate swap are included in the line entitled loss on interest rate swap in our consolidated statements of operations 
reductions or changes in reimbursement from government or third party payors and other regulatory changes affecting our industry could adversely affect our operating results 
we derive a substantial portion of our net operating revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs 
see item  business  sources of revenues  for a table identifying the sources and relative payor mix of our revenues 
historically  congress and some state legislatures have periodically proposed significant changes in regulations governing the healthcare system 
many of these changes have resulted in limitations on and  in some cases  significant reductions in the levels of payments to healthcare providers for services under many government reimbursement programs 
for the period from april  through september   the medicare act reduced the medicare reimbursement levels for inpatient rehabilitation hospitals to the levels existing in the third quarter of in  increased patient volumes offset the negative impact of the pricing roll back 
if we are not able to maintain increased volumes to offset this pricing roll back or any future pricing freeze or roll back  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our results could be further adversely affected by other changes in laws or regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs  as well as possible changes to or expansion of the audit processes conducted by medicare contractors or medicare recovery audit contractors 
for a discussion of the factors affecting reimbursement for our services  see item  business  sources of revenues medicare reimbursement 
in addition  there are increasing pressures from many third party payors to control healthcare costs and to reduce or limit increases in reimbursement rates for medical services 
our relationships with managed care and non governmental third party payors  such as health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations  are generally governed by negotiated agreements 
these agreements set forth the amounts we are entitled to receive for our services 
we could be adversely affected in some of the markets where we operate if we are unable to negotiate and maintain favorable agreements with third party payors 
additionally  our third party payors may  from time to time  request audits of the amounts paid to us under our agreements with them 
we could be adversely affected in some of the markets where we operate if the audits uncover substantial overpayments made to us 
the adoption of more restrictive medicare coverage policies at the national or local levels could have an adverse impact on our ability to obtain medicare reimbursement for inpatient rehabilitation services 
medicare providers also can be negatively affected by the adoption of coverage policies  either at the national or local levels  describing whether an item or service is covered and under what clinical circumstances it is considered to be reasonable  necessary  and appropriate 
in the absence of a national coverage determination  local medicare contractors may specify more restrictive criteria than otherwise would apply nationally 
for instance  cahaba government benefit administrators  the medicare contractor for many of our hospitals  has issued a local coverage determination setting forth very detailed criteria for determining the medical appropriateness of services provided by inpatient rehabilitation hospitals 
we cannot predict whether other medicare contractors will adopt additional local coverage determinations or other policies or how these will affect us 
competition for staffing may increase our labor costs and reduce profitability 
our operations are dependent on the efforts  abilities  and experience of our management and medical support personnel  such as physical therapists  nurses  and other healthcare professionals 
we compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and support personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our hospitals 
in some markets  the lack of availability of physical therapists  nurses  and other medical support personnel has become a significant operating issue to healthcare providers 
this shortage may require us to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified personnel or to hire more expensive temporary personnel 
we also depend on the available labor pool of semi skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate 
if our labor costs increase  we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs 
because a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed  prospective payments  our ability to pass along increased labor costs is limited 
our failure to recruit and retain qualified management  physical therapists  nurses  and other medical support personnel  or to control our labor costs  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
if we fail to comply with our corporate integrity agreement  or if the hhs oig determines we have violated federal laws governing kickbacks  false claims and self referrals  we could be subject to severe sanctions  including substantial civil money penalties 
in december  we entered into a corporate integrity agreement  or the cia  with the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services the hhs oig to promote our compliance with the requirements of medicare  medicaid  and all other federal healthcare programs 
we have also entered into two addendums to this agreement 
the cia expires at the end of  subject to the hhs oig accepting and approving our annual report for that we will submit in the first half of under the agreement and addendums  we are subject to certain administrative requirements and are subject to review of certain medicare cost reports and reimbursement claims by an independent review organization see note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our failure to comply with the material terms of the cia could lead to suspension or exclusion from further participation in federal healthcare programs  including medicare and medicaid  which currently account for a substantial portion of our revenues 
further  if the hhs oig determines that we have violated the anti kickback laws  the false claims act or the federal stark statute s general prohibition on physician self referrals  we may be subject to significant civil monetary penalties  and may be excluded from further participation in federal healthcare programs 
any of these sanctions would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
if we fail to comply with the extensive laws and government regulations applicable to healthcare providers  we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 
as a healthcare provider  we are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal  state  and local government levels 
these laws and regulations relate to  among other things licensure  certification  and accreditation  coding and billing for services  requirements of the rule  including the compliance threshold under the medicare act  relationships with physicians and other referral sources  including physician self referral and anti kickback laws  quality of medical care  use and maintenance of medical supplies and equipment  maintenance and security of medical records  acquisition and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances  and disposal of medical and hazardous waste 
in the future  changes in these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our investment structure  hospitals  equipment  personnel  services  capital expenditure programs  operating procedures  and contractual arrangements 
although we have invested substantial time  effort  and expense in implementing internal controls and procedures designed to ensure regulatory compliance  if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we could be subjected to liabilities  including criminal penalties  civil penalties  including monetary penalties and the loss of our licenses to operate one or more of our hospitals  and exclusion or suspension of one or more of our hospitals from participation in the medicare  medicaid  and other federal and state healthcare programs 
substantial damages and other remedies assessed against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
our hospitals face national  regional  and local competition for patients from other healthcare providers 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
although we are the nation s largest provider of inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services  in any particular market we may encounter competition from local or national entities with longer operating histories or other competitive advantages 
there can be no assurance that this competition  or other competition which we may encounter in the future  will not adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in addition  weakening certificate of need laws in some states could potentially increase competition in those states 
we remain a defendant in a number of lawsuits  and may be subject to liability under qui tam cases  the outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
although we have settled the major litigation pending against us  we remain a defendant in a number of lawsuits and the material lawsuits are discussed in note  contingencies and other commitments  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
substantial damages and other remedies assessed against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows

unresolved staff comments none 
item properties we maintain our principal executive offices at grandview parkway formerly one healthsouth parkway  birmingham  alabama 
we occupy those office premises under a long term lease with daniel corporation daniel which expires in and includes options for us  at our discretion  to renew the lease for up to ten years in total beyond that date 
on march   we sold  for a purchase price of million in cash  our acre corporate campus and all related buildings including the  square foot corporate headquarters building in which our current principal executive offices are located  the cahaba grand conference center  and an incomplete story building formerly called the digital hospital 
as part of this transaction  we entered into our long term lease for office space within the property that was sold 
the sale agreement includes a deferred purchase price component related to the digital hospital 
if daniel sells  or otherwise monetizes its interest in  the digital hospital for cash consideration to a third party  we are entitled to of the net profit  if any and as defined in the sale agreement  realized by daniel 
in september  daniel announced that it had reached an agreement with trinity medical center trinity pursuant to which trinity will acquire the digital hospital 
the purchase price of this transaction has not been made public  and the transaction is subject to trinity receiving approval for a certificate of need con from the applicable state board of alabama 
currently  there is opposition to the potential approval of trinity s con request  and it could take months to finalize any decision by the applicable alabama board 
therefore  no assurances can be given as to whether or when any such cash flows related to the deferred purchase price component of our agreement with daniel will be received  if any  if daniel is able to realize a net profit on its transaction with trinity 
see note  property and equipment  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition to our principal executive offices  as of december   we leased or owned through various consolidated entities business locations to support our operations 
our hospital leases  which represent the largest portion of our rent expense  have average initial terms of to years 
most of our leases contain one or more options to extend the lease period for up to five additional years for each option 
our consolidated entities are generally responsible for property taxes  property and casualty insurance  and routine maintenance expenses  particularly in our leased hospitals 
other than our principal executive offices  none of our other properties is materially important

executive overview our business we are the nation s largest provider of inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services in terms of revenues  number of hospitals  and patients treated and discharged 
our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals offer specialized rehabilitative care across a wide array of diagnoses and deliver comprehensive patient care services 
the majority of patients we serve experience significant physical disabilities due to medical conditions  such as strokes  hip fractures  head injury  spinal cord injury  and neurological disorders  that are non discretionary in nature and which require rehabilitative services in an inpatient setting 
our team of highly skilled physicians  nurses  and physical  occupational  and speech therapists utilize the latest in equipment and techniques to return patients to home and work 
patient care is provided by nursing and therapy staff as directed by a physician order 
internal case managers monitor each patient s progress and provide documentation of patient status  achievement of goals  discharge planning  and functional outcomes 
our hospitals provide a comprehensive interdisciplinary clinical approach to treatment that leads to what we believe is a higher level of care and superior outcomes 
we operate inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and long term acute care hospitals ltchs and provide treatment on both an inpatient and outpatient basis 
as of december   we operated inpatient rehabilitation hospitals including joint venture hospitals which we account for using the equity method of accounting  freestanding ltchs  outpatient rehabilitation satellites operated by our hospitals  and licensed  hospital based home health agencies 
in addition to healthsouth hospitals  we manage eight inpatient rehabilitation units and one outpatient satellite through management contracts 
our inpatient hospitals are located in states  with a concentration of hospitals in texas  pennsylvania  florida  tennessee  and alabama 
as of december   we also had two hospitals in puerto rico 
as of december   we operated inpatient rehabilitation hospitals 
in the second quarter of  we consolidated our odessa  texas inpatient rehabilitation facility into our midland  texas inpatient rehabilitation hospital 
in the third quarter of  we acquired the rehabilitation hospital of south jersey  as discussed below and in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
during the third quarter of  management made the decision to close our hospital in dallas  texas  effective october  net patient revenue from our hospitals increased from to inpatient discharges increased from to same store discharges experienced growth of from to our results for the year ended december  included an increase in our medicare reimbursement that was effective october  however  this pricing increase was removed effective april  as part of the pricing roll back of the medicare act  as discussed in item  business  and below in this item 
operating earnings as defined in note  quarterly data unaudited  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for and were million and million  respectively 
this improvement resulted from our increased revenues year over year 
operating earnings for the year ended december  included gains of million associated with government  class action  and related settlements  including the gain on ubs settlement see note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in the business outlook section below and throughout this report  our primary emphasis remains on debt reduction and further deleveraging  especially during this period of global economic uncertainty 
in total during  we used approximately million of cash to reduce our total debt outstanding see note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  during february  we used our federal income tax refund for tax years through see note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements along with available cash to reduce our term loan facility by million and amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility to zero 
we also intend to use the majority of the net cash proceeds from the ubs settlement as described in note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements to pay down long term debt 
we believe the demand for inpatient rehabilitation services will increase as the us population ages 
in addition  medicare compliant cases are expected to grow approximately per year for the foreseeable future  creating an attractive market 
we believe these market factors align with our strengths and focus in inpatient rehabilitative care 
unlike many of our competitors that may offer inpatient rehabilitation as one of many secondary services  inpatient rehabilitation is our core business 
development activities we entered seeking disciplined growth opportunities for our inpatient rehabilitation business in the context of our primary emphasis on debt reduction and further deleveraging 
during the year  we completed the following acquisitions see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in july  we purchased the rehabilitation hospital of south jersey  a bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in vineland  new jersey 
this transaction added a third new jersey rehabilitation hospital to our northeast region 
in august  we acquired an inpatient rehabilitation unit at the medical center of arlington in texas 
the operations of this unit were relocated to  and consolidated with  healthsouth rehabilitation hospital of arlington 
in august  we acquired an inpatient rehabilitation hospital in midland  texas from rehabcare corporation 
the operations of this hospital were relocated to  and consolidated with  healthsouth rehabilitation hospital of midland odessa 
in addition to these acquisitions that are included in our results of operations  we also commenced the following development projects during the year in june  a certificate of need was approved that will enable us to establish up to a bed comprehensive medical rehabilitation hospital in marion county  florida 
the certificate of need has been contested by two competitors in the market and is progressing through the normal florida certificate of need appeals process 
the appeals process is expected to take at least one year  and there can be no assurance regarding the timing or outcome 
our certificate of need application for a new bed rehabilitation hospital in loudoun county  virginia was approved on july  we expect to break ground on this site in the first half of in october  we broke ground on a new  bed freestanding inpatient rehabilitation hospital in mesa  arizona  and we expect operations to commence in the third quarter of significant events during the first quarter of  we finalized the sale of our corporate campus see note  property and equipment  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as part of this transaction  we entered into a lease for office space within the property that was sold 
the sale of this property will help us continue to reduce corporate operating expenses going forward 
the net proceeds from this transaction were used to reduce amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility in april see note  liquidity  and note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
on june   healthsouth finalized the issuance and sale of million shares of its common stock to jp morgan securities inc for net proceeds of approximately million 
the company used the net proceeds of the offering primarily for redemption and repayment of short term and long term borrowings 
see note  liquidity  and note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding use of the net proceeds 
in october  we entered into an agreement  approved by the court on january   with ubs securities  llc ubs securities to settle litigation filed by the derivative plaintiffs on the company s behalf 
under the settlement  million in cash previously paid into escrow by ubs securities and its insurance carriers will be released to us  and we will receive a release of all claims by ubs securities  including the release and satisfaction of an approximate million judgment in favor of an affiliate of ubs securities related to a loan guarantee 
out of the million cash settlement proceeds received from ubs securities and its insurance carriers  we are obligated to pay million in fees and expenses to the derivative plaintiffs attorneys  and pursuant to the previously disclosed settlement agreements in the consolidated securities litigation  of the net proceeds  after deducting all of our costs and expenses in connection with the derivative litigation  will be paid to plaintiffs in the consolidated securities litigation 
see note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these funds are expected to be dispersed to the applicable parties during the first quarter of we intend to use the majority of our net cash proceeds to reduce long term debt 
in october  we received a total cash refund of approximately million including interest attributable to our settlement with the internal revenue service the irs for tax years through we used the majority of this cash to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit agreement 
see note  long term debt  and note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  we settled federal income tax issues outstanding with the irs for the tax years through  and the joint committee on taxation reviewed and approved the associated income tax refund of approximately million including interest due to the company 
in february  we received the majority of this cash and used it to pay down long term debt 
regulatory challenges to the inpatient rehabilitation industry over the last several years  changes in regulation governing inpatient rehabilitation reimbursement have created a challenging operating environment for inpatient rehabilitation services 
specifically  on may   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms issued a final rule  known as the rule  stipulating that to qualify as an inpatient rehabilitation facility under the medicare program a facility must show that a certain percentage of its patients are treated for at least one of a specified and limited list of medical conditions 
under the rule  any inpatient rehabilitation hospital that failed to meet the requirements of the rule would be subject to prospective reclassification as an acute care hospital  with lower acute care payment rates for rehabilitative services 
however  the impact of the rule was significantly greater than cms initially envisioned  and it required us to deny admissions to our hospitals 
the compliance threshold of the rule was in the process of being phased in over time  and was already at or higher for all of our hospitals at the end of however  on december   the medicare  medicaid and state children s health insurance program schip extension act of the medicare act was signed  permanently setting the compliance threshold at instead of  and allowing hospitals to continue using a patient s secondary medical conditions  or comorbidities  to determine whether a patient qualifies for inpatient rehabilitation care under the rule 
an additional element to the medicare act was a reduction in the pricing of services eligible for medicare reimbursement to a pricing level that existed in the third quarter of  or a medicare pricing roll back  which has resulted in a decrease in actual reimbursement dollars per discharge despite increases in costs 
the roll back is effective from april  until september  the long term impact of the freeze at the compliance threshold was positive because it allowed patient volumes to stabilize 
in  increased patient volumes from both our focus on standardized sales and marketing efforts and the fact that more patients now have access to our high quality inpatient rehabilitative services offset the negative impact of the pricing roll back see this item  results of operations net operating revenues 
we expect the negative impact of the pricing roll back to continue to be offset partially by our volume increases see this item  business outlook 
key challenges while we met our operational goals in  we continue to face challenges  including leverage and liquidity 
our leverage remains higher than we would like  and it increases our cost of borrowing and decreases our net income 
however  we have made reducing debt a primary strategic focus  and our leverage and liquidity are improving 
during  we used approximately million of cash to reduce our total debt outstanding see note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  during february  we used our federal income tax refund for tax years through see note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements along with available cash to reduce our term loan facility by million and amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility to zero 
we also intend to use the majority of the net cash proceeds from the ubs settlement as described in note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements to pay down long term debt 
our primary sources of funding are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  excluding amounts that are restricted due to various obligations we have under lending agreements  partnership agreements  and other arrangements see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  cash and marketable securities  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  as of december   we had approximately million available under our revolving credit facility  net of amounts utilized under our revolving letter of credit subfacility 
an additional million which represents the letter of credit issued in lieu of a bond in the new york action  as discussed in note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements will become available in connection with the court s implementation of the order approving the final ubs settlement  which we expect to be completed in the first quarter of we have scheduled principal payments of million and million in and  respectively  related to long term debt obligations see note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our earliest refinancing risk is  when our revolving credit facility expires  and  when our term loan facility matures 
the majority of our bonds are not due until and as with any company carrying significant debt  our primary risk relating to our leverage is the possibility that a rapid increase in interest rates and or a down turn in operating earnings could impair our ability to comply with the financial covenants contained within our credit agreement 
loans under our credit agreement bear interest at a rate of  at our option  month  month  month  or month libor or the prime rate  plus an applicable margin that varies depending upon our leverage ratio and corporate credit rating 
our primary covenants include a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio  with the interest coverage ratio being a four consecutive fiscal quarters test 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement  and we do not envision any violation of these covenants in for additional information regarding our leverage and liquidity  see item  business  the liquidity and capital resources section of this item  and note  liquidity  and note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
see also item a  risk factors  and note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of risks and uncertainties facing us 
as with most companies  changes in our business or other factors may occur that might have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
reimbursement 
historically  congress and some state legislatures have periodically proposed significant changes in regulations governing the healthcare system 
many of these changes have resulted in limitations on and  in some cases  significant reductions in the levels of payments to healthcare providers for services under many government reimbursement programs 
for example  and as discussed above  while the freeze at the compliance threshold under the medicare act is a long term positive for us  the pricing roll back is a short term negative in and a portion of in addition  and as discussed in item  business  there can be no assurance there will be an increase in medicare reimbursement pricing upon the expiration of the roll back period 
because medicare comprised approximately of our net operating revenues for the year ended december   single payor exposure and any potential legislative changes present risks to us 
because we receive a significant percentage of our revenues from medicare  our inability to achieve continued compliance with the threshold under the medicare act could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition to government payors  our relationships with managed care and non governmental third party payors are generally governed by negotiated agreements 
these agreements set forth the amounts we are entitled to receive for our services 
if we are unable to negotiate and maintain favorable agreements with these payors  our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be adversely impacted 
staffing 
our operations are dependent on the efforts  abilities  and experience of our professional medical personnel  such as physical therapists  nurses  and other healthcare professionals  and our management 
if we are unable to recruit and retain qualified physical therapists  nurses  other medical support personnel  or management  or to control our labor costs  our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be adversely impacted 
during  we maintained competitive salary structures while making an investment  in the form of enhanced benefits programs  in our employees in an effort to reduce turnover at our hospitals and attract qualified healthcare professionals to our business 
recruiting and retaining qualified personnel for our hospitals will remain a high priority for the company on a go forward basis 
however  we must balance our ability to maintain a competitive total compensation package with our goal of being a high quality  low cost provider of inpatient rehabilitation services 
see the results of operations salaries and benefits section of this item for additional information 
business outlook as the nation s largest provider of inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services  we believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors based on the quality of our clinical protocols  our broad base of clinical experience  our ability to create and leverage rehabilitative technology  and our ability to standardize practices and take advantage of efficiencies that result in cost effective  high quality care for our patients 
strategic outlook our largest referral source is acute care hospitals  and it is not uncommon for acute care volumes  some of which are discretionary in nature  to decrease during periods of economic uncertainty 
the majority of patients we serve have medical conditions  such as strokes  hip fractures  and neurological disorders  that are non discretionary in nature and which require rehabilitative services in an inpatient setting 
in addition  our revenue and accounts receivable balances are heavily weighted toward medicare  and we do not believe there is significant credit risk associated with this government payor 
consequently  we believe we are well positioned to weather such economic periods 
as a result  we expect the current economic uncertainty will only minimally impact our provision for doubtful accounts 
the area of our business at the most risk for decreases in discretionary spending is our outpatient services 
however  this area of our business represents less than of our consolidated net operating revenues  so we anticipate minimal impact to our overall results 
we believe the above assessment of our ability to manage through these difficult economic times is evidenced by our continued volume growth in the latter half of when our consolidated portfolio yielded same store growth in discharges of approximately and for the third and fourth quarters of compared to the same quarters of  respectively 
in addition  our provision for doubtful accounts remained within our stated range of to of net operating revenues 
further  we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity due to our cash and cash equivalents and the availability of our revolving credit facility 
our earliest refinancing risk is  when our revolving credit facility expires  and  when our term loan facility matures 
the majority of our bonds are not due until and in total during  we used approximately million of cash to reduce our total debt outstanding see note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  during february  we used our federal income tax refund for tax years through see note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements along with available cash to reduce our term loan facility by million and amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility to zero 
we also intend to use the majority of the net cash proceeds from the ubs settlement as described in note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements to pay down long term debt 
as we reassessed the appropriateness of our strategic outlook during the current economic uncertainty  we took a critical look at our development strategy  especially as it related to de novo projects 
in recognition of changing economic conditions  we will continue to be disciplined in our approach to development opportunities  carefully evaluating these opportunities against our deleveraging priority 
for the foreseeable future  reducing our long term debt will be a key objective 
we will continue to pursue bed expansions in existing hospitals as they provide immediate earnings growth  and we will pursue acquisitions and market consolidations where we can do so with minimal initial cash outlays 
for any de novo project we decide to pursue  we will work with third parties willing to assume the majority of the financing risks associated with these projects 
operating outlook in  we launched a multi year operational initiative designed to identify best practices in a number of key areas and standardize those practices across all our hospitals 
this initiative is known as teamworks 
during the start up phase of this project  we chose two areas as our initial focus sales and marketing 
increasing the number of patients we serve is critical to maintaining and improving our profitability  particularly in light of the high percentage of fixed costs at our hospitals and the medicare pricing roll back discussed earlier 
non clinical support costs 
over the past few years  we have focused on managing the non clinical expenses of our hospitals due to the regulatory uncertainty that was caused by the rule and rising labor costs resulting from shortages of therapists and nurses 
although we have generally reduced most categories of expenses  there is a high degree of variability from hospital to hospital 
as a result  the non clinical support costs initiative was chosen in order to further standardize our best practices in this area 
as a result of our teamworks initiative  we experienced an increase in patient discharges from to over the years  we have developed clinical programs  such as those focusing on stroke and other neurological disorders  and have invested in technology to meet the needs of patients requiring inpatient rehabilitative care 
our sales and marketing efforts implemented as part of the teamworks initiative have focused on these programs  which benefit higher acuity patients 
typically  these conditions provide higher net patient revenue per discharge because of the higher level of services and resources required 
during the third quarter of  we completed the implementation of the above two phases of teamworks at all of our hospitals 
as we finalize our plans for the next phase of teamworks  we are also implementing a sustainability module to ensure the operational initiatives from the start up phase of the project remain embedded at our hospitals 
we remain optimistic about the project s ability to drive market share based on the results we have seen thus far 
our salaries and benefits grew as a percent of net operating revenues during due to various factors  including the increase in the cost of certain benefits provided to our employees 
we are actively managing the productive portion of our salaries and benefits  and we have taken steps to address the non productive component of these expenses see this item  results of operations salaries and benefits 
we expect to see a meaningful improvement in the non productive component of salaries and benefits during  as we transitioned into a new benefit year effective january  we continue to monitor the labor market and will make any necessary adjustments to remain competitive in this challenging environment while also being consistent with our goal of being a high quality  low cost provider of inpatient rehabilitative services 
in addition to the specific challenges we face with staffing levels and costs  we are not immune to the impact the current global economic situation is having on the operating costs of most companies 
specifically  we are experiencing increased utility costs and increased pricing related to supplies  especially pharmaceutical costs 
because our payor mix is weighted heavily towards medicare  we will be challenged in managing these rising costs as a percent of revenue given the medicare pricing roll back that became effective april  and remains effective through september  however  we will be implementing strategies to address these rising costs 
quarter over quarter comparisons for the first quarter of will not be on an equal basis to the prior year due to the medicare pricing roll back 
the first quarter of contained a medicare pricing increase that became effective october  but was rolled back from our medicare reimbursement on april  in addition  our year over year and quarter over quarter comparisons to were positively impacted by the freeze at the compliance threshold under the medicare act 
prior to the signing of the medicare act on december   many of our hospitals were limiting admissions due to phase in requirements under the rule see item  business 
we believe we can sustain discharge growth of at least annually 
see this item  results of operations net operating revenues  for additional information 
in summary  we believe we are well positioned to weather the current economic environment 
we do not believe our volumes or bad debt expense will be materially adversely impacted 
we plan to continue to use the majority of our excess cash flow to reduce debt 
on a go forward basis  we anticipate we will be able to generate cash flows to fund additional debt reduction and disciplined  opportunistic development activities  which we believe will bring long term  sustainable growth and returns to our stockholders 
results of operations during   and  we derived consolidated net operating revenues from the following payor sources for the year ended december  medicare medicaid workers compensation managed care and other discount plans other third party payors patients other income total our payor mix is weighted heavily towards medicare 
our hospitals receive medicare reimbursements under the prospective payment system applicable to inpatient rehabilitation facilities irf pps 
under irf pps  our hospitals receive fixed payment amounts per discharge based on certain rehabilitation impairment categories established by the united states department of health and human services 
with irf pps  our hospitals retain the difference  if any  between the fixed payment from medicare and their operating costs 
thus  our hospitals benefit from being high quality  low cost providers 
for additional information regarding medicare reimbursement  see the sources of revenues section of item  business 
the percent of our net operating revenues attributable to medicare has decreased over the past few years due to an increase in managed medicare and private fee for service plans that are included in the managed care and other discount plans and other third party payors categories in the above table 
as part of the balanced budget act of  congress created a program of private  managed healthcare coverage for medicare beneficiaries 
this program has been referred to as medicare part c  medicare choice  or medicare advantage 
the program offers beneficiaries a range of medicare coverage options by providing a choice between the traditional fee for service program under medicare parts a and b or enrollment in a health maintenance organization  preferred provider organization  point of service plan  provider sponsored organization or an insurance plan operated in conjunction with a medical savings account 
while we expect our payor mix will remain heavily weighted towards traditional medicare  we expect this shift of traditional medicare patients into managed medicare and private fee for service plans will continue 
however  the future of medicare part c will be determined  ultimately  by congress  and any changes to medicare part c may have an impact on this trend 
under irf pps  hospitals are reimbursed on a per discharge basis 
thus  the number of patient discharges is a key metric utilized by management to monitor and evaluate our performance 
the number of outpatient visits is also tracked in order to measure the volume of outpatient activity each period 
certain financial results have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
such reclassifications primarily relate to one hospital and one gamma knife radiosurgery center we identified in that qualified under financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to be reported as assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
we reclassified our consolidated balance sheet as of december  to show the assets and liabilities of these qualifying facilities as held for sale 
we also reclassified our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december  and to show the results of those qualifying facilities as discontinued operations 
as discussed in the results of discontinued operations section of this item and note  assets held for sale and results of discontinued operations  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  we divested our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions during because we did not allocate corporate overhead by division  our operating results for the years ended december  and reflect overhead costs associated with managing and providing shared services to these divisions  through their respective dates of sale  even though these divisions qualify as discontinued operations

these comparisons include the financial results of market consolidation transactions in existing markets  as it is difficult to determine  with precision  the incremental impact of these transactions on our results of operations 
net operating revenues our consolidated net operating revenues consist primarily of revenues derived from patient care services 
net operating revenues also include other revenues generated from management and administrative fees and other non patient care services 
these other revenues approximated   and of consolidated net operating revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
while our net operating revenues are being negatively impacted by the pricing roll back that is part of the medicare act the pricing roll back is effective from april  until september   our teamworks initiative is producing results that yielded an increase in patient discharges in each quarter of cumulative of increase in discharges for all hospitals hospitals with teamworks quarter over quarter year over year q q q q net patient revenue from our hospitals benefited from three acquisitions in the third quarter of see item  business  this item  executive overview  and note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
net patient revenue from our hospitals was higher for the year ended december  than as shown in the above table  we experienced a year over year increase in patient discharges primarily as a result of our teamworks initiative 
same store discharges were higher in than in based on industry data published through the uniform data system for medical rehabilitation the uds for the third quarter of  our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals continued to grow their market share in this industry information  as reported through the uds under the presumptive method on a quarter lag  showed case growth by healthsouth during the nine months ended september  compared to an average case growth for uds industry sites including healthsouth 
medicare compliant cases are expected to grow approximately per year for the foreseeable future 
we believe we can sustain discharge growth of at least annually 
decreased outpatient volumes in compared to resulted primarily from the closure of outpatient satellites  but challenges in securing therapy staffing in certain markets and continued competition from physicians offering physical therapy services within their own offices also contributed to the decline 
we also made the decision to staff our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in lieu of some of our outpatient satellites due to staffing shortages 
as of december   we operated outpatient satellites  while as of december   we operated outpatient satellites 
strong unit pricing and the closure of underperforming satellites resulted in higher net patient revenue per visit in compared to we continuously monitor the performance of our outpatient satellites and will take appropriate action with respect to underperforming facilities  including closure 
net patient revenue from our hospitals was higher for the year ended december  than the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our patient case mix index and compliant case growth  both of which increased our revenue per discharge 
inpatient volumes during were relatively flat compared to due primarily to nine hospitals that moved from a compliance threshold to a compliance threshold under the rule on july  discharges for the year were also negatively impacted by of our hospitals that moved from a compliance threshold to a compliance threshold under the rule on june  increased revenues attributable to our inpatient hospitals were offset by decreased revenues from outpatient visits 
decreased outpatient volumes resulted from the closure of outpatient satellites  changes in patient program mix  shortages in therapy staffing  and continued competition from physicians offering physical therapy services within their own offices 
as of december   we operated outpatient satellites  while as of december   we operated outpatient satellites 
quarter over quarter comparisons for the first quarter of will not be on an equal basis to the prior year due to the medicare pricing roll back 
the first quarter of contained a medicare pricing increase that became effective october  but was rolled back from our medicare reimbursement on april  in addition  our year over year and quarter over quarter comparisons to were positively impacted by the freeze at the compliance threshold under the medicare act 
prior to the signing of the medicare act on december   many of our hospitals were limiting admissions due to phase in requirements under the rule see item  business 
salaries and benefits salaries and benefits represent the most significant cost to us and include all amounts paid to full and part time employees who directly participate in or support the operations of our hospitals  including all related costs of benefits provided to employees 
it also includes amounts paid for contract labor 
salaries and benefits grew as a percent of net operating revenues during due to various factors additional employees needed as a result of additional volumes  costs associated with recruiting  training  and orienting these new employees  annual merit increases  and increases in the cost of benefits provided to our employees 
we are actively managing the productive portion of our salaries and benefits 
to manage our productivity  we utilize certain metrics  including employees per occupied bed  or epob 
this metric is determined by dividing the number of full time equivalents  including an estimate of full time equivalents from the utilization of contract labor  by the number of occupied beds during each period 
the number of occupied beds is determined by multiplying the number of licensed beds by our occupancy percentage 
for the years ended december  and  our epob was and  respectively  or a year over year improvement of 
while we successfully managed our productivity in  non productive factors contributed to the year over year increase in salaries and benefits 
first  as reported previously  on october   we gave merit increases  which averaged  to most of our employees and adjusted certain salary ranges in select markets 
we also received a medicare pricing adjustment at the same time 
however  this medicare increase was eliminated on april   which had the effect of increasing salaries and benefits as a percent of net operating revenues in as it is routine to provide merit increases to our employees on october of each year  which normally coincides with our annual medicare pricing adjustment  we provided an approximate merit increase to our employees effective october  second  as also previously reported  in an effort to improve retention and reduce turnover at our hospitals  we enhanced certain benefits effective january  in addition to these enhancements  we consolidated numerous paid time off pto plans across our hospitals  which led to increased pto for many of our employees 
we have addressed our comprehensive benefits package and made refinements that will allow us to remain competitive in this challenging staffing environment while also being consistent with our goal of being a high quality  low cost provider of inpatient rehabilitative services 
such refinements included  but were not limited to  passing along a portion of the increased costs associated with medical plan benefits to our employees and reducing certain aspects of our pto program 
the majority of changes to these benefit plans became effective january  finally  we pay our employees for non productive hours related to orientation  training  and other similar items 
as we recruited new employees to meet the staffing needs associated with our increased volumes  the costs associated with our orientation and training efforts increased 
we anticipate this cost will level off once we are able to adjust our permanent staffing levels to accommodate our higher volumes 
salaries and benefits also increased from to annual merit increases given to employees in october contributed to the increase 
in addition  shortages of therapists and nurses caused us to raise salaries to retain current employees and to increase our utilization of higher priced contract labor to properly care for our patients in finally  as a result of our efforts to comply with the rule  we treated higher acuity patients in than in  which resulted in increased labor costs 
our staffing priority is always to effectively treat our patients and to continue achieving the excellence in clinical outcomes that differentiates us from our competitors 
we have addressed the non productive component of our salaries and benefits  and we will continue to actively manage the productive component 
we expect to see a meaningful improvement in the non productive component of salaries and benefits during  as we have now transitioned into a new benefit year 
other operating expenses other operating expenses include costs associated with managing and maintaining our hospitals 
these expenses include such items as contract services  utilities  professional fees  insurance  and repairs and maintenance 
in   and  we experienced a reduction in self insurance costs due to revised actuarial estimates that resulted from current claims history  industry wide loss development trends  and our exit from businesses that were more claims intensive 
these reductions are primarily included in other operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december    and see note  summary of significant accounting policies  self insured risks  for additional information 
other operating expenses were higher during than in primarily due to increased patient volumes  repairs and maintenance expenses associated with the refurbishment of some of our aging hospitals  and costs associated with the implementation of our teamworks initiative 
we are also experiencing increased utility costs 
other operating expenses were higher in than in due to professional fees associated with our teamworks initiative 
also  as discussed in more detail in note  related party transactions  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  other operating expenses for the year ended december  included a million gain related to the repayment of a formerly fully reserved note receivable from source medical solutions  inc source medical 
while we are taking steps to address these rising costs  because our payor mix is heavily weighted toward medicare  we will be challenged in managing these rising costs as a percent of net operating revenues  given the medicare pricing roll back that became effective april  and remains effective through september  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses primarily include administrative expenses such as corporate accounting  internal audit and controls  legal  and information technology services that are managed from our corporate headquarters in birmingham  alabama 
these expenses include the salaries and benefits of   and full time equivalents for the years ended december    and  respectively  who perform these administrative functions 
these expenses also include all stock based compensation expenses recorded in accordance with fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment 
as discussed in the results of discontinued operations section of this item and note  assets held for sale and results of discontinued operations  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  we divested our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions during because we did not allocate corporate overhead by division  our operating results for the years ended december  and reflect overhead costs associated with managing and providing shared services to these divisions  through their respective dates of sale  even though these divisions qualify as discontinued operations 
our general and administrative expenses were lower in compared to due primarily to the right sizing of our corporate departments following the divestitures of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions 
the reduction in general and administrative expenses resulting from our divestiture transactions was partially offset by rent expense associated with the sale of our corporate campus and subsequent leasing of our corporate office space within the same property that was sold 
our general and administrative expenses were lower in compared to due also to the divestitures of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions in the second and third quarters of the reduction in general and administrative expenses resulting from our divestiture transactions was offset by our investment in a development function and costs associated with installing new accounting systems 
also  given the uncertainty surrounding our repositioning efforts in the first half of  we experienced attrition of corporate employees who supported our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions 
as this attrition occurred  we chose to utilize higher priced contract labor to temporarily fill certain corporate positions rather than hiring new employees to fill the open positions 
we continue to monitor our general and administrative expenses for opportunities to improve our financial results 
our targeted level of general and administrative expenses excluding stock compensation expense is of net operating revenues 
supplies supplies expense includes all costs associated with supplies used while providing patient care 
these costs include pharmaceuticals  food  needles  bandages  and other similar items 
the increase in supplies expense from to was due primarily to an increase in the number of patients treated 
we are also experiencing increased pricing related to supplies  especially pharmaceutical costs 
while supplies expense did not change significantly in terms of dollars from to  it did decrease as a percent of net operating revenues year over year 
this decrease was due to our supply chain management efforts and our increasing revenue base 
while we are taking steps to address these rising costs  because our payor mix is heavily weighted toward medicare  we will be challenged in managing these rising costs as a percent of net operating revenues  given the medicare pricing roll back that became effective april  and remains effective through september  depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  compared to primarily resulted from the sale of our corporate campus during the first quarter of we sold our corporate campus to daniel corporation daniel on march  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 we reviewed our depreciation estimates of our corporate campus based on the revised salvage value of the campus due to the expected sale transaction 
during the first quarter of  we accelerated the depreciation of our corporate campus by approximately million so that the net book value of the corporate campus equaled the net proceeds received on the transaction s closing date 
the year over year impact of this acceleration of depreciation approximated million 
the increase in depreciation associated with the sale of our corporate campus was offset by a general decrease in depreciation and amortization due to the decreased depreciable base of our assets due to the level of our capital expenditures over the past few years 
the decrease in the depreciable base of our assets also resulted in the decrease in depreciation and amortization from to as a result of our development activities  as discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  goodwill and other intangible assets  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  we expect our depreciation and amortization charges to increase going forward 
impairment of long lived assets during  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
this charge represented our write down of certain long lived assets associated with one of our hospitals to their estimated fair value based on an offer we received from a third party to acquire the assets 
during  we recognized long lived asset impairment charges of million 
approximately million of these charges related to the digital hospital as defined in note  property and equipment  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
on june   we entered into an agreement with an investment fund sponsored by trammell crow company trammell crow pursuant to which trammell crow agreed to acquire our corporate campus for a purchase price of approximately million  subject to certain adjustments 
we wrote the digital hospital down by million to its estimated fair value based on the estimated net proceeds we expected to receive from this sale 
the agreement to sell our corporate campus to trammell crow was terminated on august   pursuant to an opt out provision in the agreement which trammell crow exercised 
as discussed earlier in this item and in note  property and equipment  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  we sold our corporate campus to daniel on march  during  we recognized long lived asset impairment charges of million 
approximately million of these charges related to the digital hospital and represented the excess of costs incurred during the construction of the digital hospital over the estimated fair value of the property  including the river point facility  a  square foot office building which shares the construction site 
the impairment of the digital hospital in was determined using a weighted average fair value approach that considered an alternative use appraisal and other potential scenarios

occupancy costs occupancy costs include amounts paid for rent associated with leased hospitals  including common area maintenance and similar charges 
these costs did not change significantly in the periods presented 
provision for doubtful accounts as disclosed previously  we completed the installation of new collections software in the latter half of distractions associated with the installation of this new software negatively impacted collection activity during starting in the third quarter of  our provision for doubtful accounts as a percent of net operating revenues became more reflective of the benefits we are seeing from the new collections software  as well as the standardization of certain business office processes 
this positive trend continued in we continue to experience the denial of certain billings by one of our medicare contractors based on medical necessity 
we appeal most of these denials and have experienced a strong success rate for claims that have completed the appeals process 
while our success rate is a positive reflection of the medical necessity of the applicable patients  the appeal process can take in excess of one year  and we cannot provide assurance as to the ongoing and future success of our appeals 
as such  we have provided reserves for these receivables in accordance with our accounting policy that necessarily considers the age of the receivables under appeal as part of our provision for doubtful accounts

in january  the proposed settlement received final court approval  and  based on the value of our common stock and the associated common stock warrants on the date the settlement was approved  we reduced this liability by approximately million as of december  based on the value of our common stock and the associated common stock warrants as of december  and  we reduced this liability by an additional million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reductions in each year are included in government  class action  and related settlements expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the charge for this settlement will be revised in future periods to reflect additional changes in the fair value of the common stock and warrants until they are issued

impact of inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace 
while we believe the current economic climate may help to moderate wage increases in the near term  there can be no guarantee we will not experience continued increases in the cost of labor  as the need for clinical workers is expected to grow 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
more specifically  and as noted above  we are experiencing increased pricing related to supplies  especially pharmaceutical costs  and other operating expenses 
although we cannot predict our ability to cover future cost increases  we believe that through adherence to cost containment policies and labor and supply management  the effects of inflation on future operating results should be manageable 
however  we have little or no ability to pass on these increased costs associated with providing services to medicare and medicaid patients due to federal and state laws that establish fixed reimbursement rates 
in addition  as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures and a continuing industry wide shift of patients to managed care plans  our ability to maintain margins through price increases to non medicare patients is limited

during  we recorded impairment charges of million 
the majority of these charges related to the dallas medical center 
we determined the fair value of the impaired long lived assets at the hospital primarily based on the assets estimated fair value using valuation techniques that included third party appraisals and an evaluation of current real estate market conditions in the applicable area 
the net loss on disposal of assets in was primarily the result of our sale of the birmingham medical center and lease termination fees associated with certain properties adjacent to the birmingham medical center

during the first quarter of  we wrote the intangible assets and certain long lived assets of our diagnostic division down to their estimated fair value based on the estimated net proceeds we expected to receive from the divestiture of the division 
this charge is included in impairments in the above results of operations of our diagnostic division as of december  liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash from operations  and revolving loans under our credit agreement as defined in note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
during  we continued to make progress in improving our leverage and liquidity 
with the continued deleveraging of the company as a priority  on june   we finalized the issuance and sale of million shares of our common stock to jp morgan securities inc for net proceeds of approximately million and used the majority of these net proceeds to reduce our total debt outstanding 
this debt reduction was in addition to the use of the net proceeds from the sale of our corporate campus in april to reduce total debt outstanding 
in addition  during october  we used the majority of our federal income tax refund for tax years through to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit agreement 
in total during  we used approximately million of cash to reduce our total debt outstanding 
however  due to the addition of two capital leases for hospitals  our total net debt reduction approximated million during see note  property and equipment  note  long term debt  note  shareholders deficit  and note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these transactions 
in addition  during february  we used our federal income tax refund for tax years through see note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements along with available cash to reduce our term loan facility by million and amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility to zero 
we also intend to use the majority of the net cash proceeds from the ubs settlement as described in note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements to pay down long term debt 
our primary sources of funding are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
this amount excludes approximately million in restricted cash and million of restricted marketable securities 
as of december   restricted cash included approximately million related to the ubs settlement see note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
this amount was transferred to us in december  with an additional million related to this settlement transferred to us in january  from ubs securities and its insurance carriers and held in escrow pending the court s implementation of the final court order entered on january  these funds are expected to be dispersed to the applicable parties during the first quarter of as noted above  we intend to use the majority of our net cash proceeds from this settlement see discussion related to amounts owed to the derivative plaintiffs attorneys and the plaintiffs in the consolidated securities litigation in note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements to reduce long term debt outstanding 
the remainder of our restricted cash pertains to various obligations we have under lending agreements  partnership agreements  and other arrangements  primarily related to our captive insurance company 
based on our current borrowing capacity and compliance with the financial covenants under our credit agreement  we do not believe there is significant risk in our ability to make additional draws under our revolving credit facility  if needed 
however  no such assurances can be provided 
during the fourth quarter of  we made a million draw on the revolving credit facility and issued letters of credit under its subfacility without incident 
the draw was used for general corporate purposes 
in light of the current global economic situation  we have evaluated  to the extent practicable  our exposure to financial services counterparties to whom we have material exposure 
we monitor the financial strength of our depositories  creditors  derivative counterparties  and insurance carriers using publicly available information  as well as qualitative inputs 
in addition  we do not face substantial near term refinancing risk  as our revolving credit facility does not expire until  our term loan facility does not mature until  and the majority of our bonds are not due until and we have scheduled principal payments of million and million in and  respectively  related to long term debt obligations see note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our primary loan covenants include a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio  with the interest coverage ratio being a four consecutive fiscal quarters test 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement 
if we anticipated a potential covenant violation  we would seek relief from our lenders  which would have some cost to us  and such relief might not be on terms as favorable to those in our existing credit agreement 
under such circumstances  there is also the potential our lenders would not grant relief to us which  among other things  would depend on the state of the credit markets at that time 
a default due to violation of the covenants contained within our credit agreement could require us to immediately repay all amounts then outstanding under the credit agreement 
see item a  risk factors  and note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of risks and uncertainties facing us 
sources and uses of cash our primary sources of funding are cash flows from operations and borrowings under long term debt agreements 
over the past three years  our funds were used primarily to service debt  fund working capital requirements  make capital expenditures  and make payments under various settlement agreements 
with the payments due under various settlement agreements now behind us  we can redirect our funds elsewhere  including the further reduction of debt 
the following table shows the cash flows provided by or used in operating  investing  and financing activities for the years ended december    and  as well as the effect of exchange rates for those same years in millions as of december  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents compared to operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in and included federal income tax refunds of approximately million and million  respectively 
if we exclude these cash refunds in each year  our net cash provided by used in operating activities becomes million and million  respectively  or a year over year improvement of million 
net cash provided by operating activities increased year over year due to the increase in net operating revenues  as discussed above  a decrease in cash interest expense  as discussed above  and a decrease in cash settlement payments related primarily to our medicare program settlement negotiated in and our sec settlement negotiated in the year ended december  included cash settlement payments of million related primarily to our settlement with the united states department of health and human services office of inspector general negotiated in for additional information related to these settlements  see note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
investing activities 
the decrease in net cash provided by investing activities was due to the cash proceeds received from the divestitures of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions during see this item  results of discontinued operations  and note  assets held for sale and results of discontinued operations  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
net cash used in investing activities for included million in expenditures associated with our development activities  including million of capital expenditures associated with land purchases for de novo projects 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  goodwill and other intangible assets  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
financing activities 
the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was due to the use of the cash proceeds from the divestitures of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions to reduce debt outstanding under our credit agreement during during  we made approximately million of net debt payments 
during  we made approximately billion of net debt payments 
the net debt payments made during primarily resulted from the sale of our corporate campus in march  the net proceeds from our june equity offering  and our federal income tax recovery in october for additional information  see note  property and equipment  note  long term debt  note  shareholders deficit  and note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
compared to operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million from to this increase resulted from higher net operating revenues and lower operating expenses year over year

net cash provided by operating activities in and also included payments of approximately million and million  respectively  related to government  class action  and related settlements

the increase in net cash provided by investing activities from to was due to the cash proceeds received from the divestitures of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions during see note  assets held for sale and results of discontinued operations  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements

the increase in net cash used in financing activities was due to the use of the net cash proceeds from the divestitures of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions see note  assets held for sale and results of discontinued operations  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  as well as the majority of our federal income tax recovery see note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  to reduce debt outstanding under our credit agreement during during  we made approximately billion of net debt payments  while during  we made approximately million of net debt payments 
financing activities for also included approximately million of net proceeds from the issuance of convertible perpetual preferred stock see note  convertible perpetual preferred stock  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
adjusted consolidated ebitda management continues to believe adjusted consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit agreement is a measure of leverage capacity  our ability to service our debt  and our ability to make capital expenditures 
we use adjusted consolidated ebitda on a consolidated basis as a liquidity measure 
we believe this financial measure on a consolidated basis is important in analyzing our liquidity because it is the key component of certain material covenants contained within our credit agreement  which is discussed in more detail in note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these covenants are material terms of the credit agreement  and the credit agreement represents a substantial portion of our capitalization 
non compliance with these financial covenants under our credit agreement our interest coverage ratio and our leverage ratio could result in our lenders requiring us to immediately repay all amounts borrowed 
if we anticipated a potential covenant violation  we would seek relief from our lenders  which would have some cost to us  and such relief might not be on terms favorable to those in our existing credit agreement 
in addition  if we cannot satisfy these financial covenants  we would be prohibited under our credit agreement from engaging in certain activities  such as incurring additional indebtedness  making certain payments  and acquiring and disposing of assets 
consequently  adjusted consolidated ebitda is critical to our assessment of our liquidity 
in general terms  the definition of adjusted consolidated ebitda  per our credit agreement  allows us to add back to adjusted consolidated ebitda all unusual non cash items or non recurring items 
these items include  but may not be limited to  amounts associated with government  class action  and related settlements  fees  costs  and expenses related to our recapitalization transactions  any losses from discontinued operations and closed locations  charges in respect of professional fees for reconstruction and restatement of financial statements  including fees paid to outside professional firms for matters related to internal controls and legal fees for continued litigation defense and support matters discussed in note  settlements  and note  contingencies and other commitments  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  compensation expenses recorded in accordance with fasb statement no 
r  investment and other income including interest income  and fees associated with our divestiture activities 
we reconcile adjusted consolidated ebitda to net income loss 
however  adjusted consolidated ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap  and the items excluded from adjusted consolidated ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
therefore  adjusted consolidated ebitda should not be considered a substitute for net income loss or cash flows from operating  investing  or financing activities 
because adjusted consolidated ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with gaap and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  adjusted consolidated ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
revenues and expenses are measured in accordance with the policies and procedures described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our adjusted consolidated ebitda for the years ended december    and was as follows in millions reconciliation of net income loss to adjusted consolidated ebitda for the year ended december  net income loss income loss from discontinued operations provision for income tax benefit expense loss on interest rate swap interest expense and amortization of debt discounts and fees loss on early extinguishment of debt government  class action  and related settlements  including the gain on ubs settlement and recovery from richard m

in addition  we are allowed to add non recurring cash gains  such as the estimated cash proceeds from the ubs settlement and the recovery from mr

we also intend to use the majority of the net cash proceeds from the ubs settlement as described in note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements to pay down long term debt

off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the definition under sec rules  the following qualify as off balance sheet arrangements any obligation under certain guarantees or contracts  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity  or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  and any obligation under a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk  or credit risk support to the registrant  or engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development services with the registrant 
the following discussion addresses each of the above items for the company 
we are secondarily liable for certain lease obligations primarily associated with sold facilities  including the sale of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions during also  in connection with the closing of the transaction to sell our diagnostic division  healthsouth remained as a guarantor of certain leases for properties and equipment and a guarantor to certain purchase and servicing contracts that were assigned to the buyer in connection with the sale 
as of december   we were secondarily liable for such guarantees 
the remaining terms of these guarantees range from one month to months 
if we were required to perform under all such guarantees  the maximum amount we would be required to pay approximated million 
we have not recorded a liability for these guarantees  as we do not believe it is probable we will have to perform under these agreements 
if we are required to perform under these guarantees  we could potentially have recourse against the purchaser for recovery of any amounts paid 
in addition  the purchasers of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions have agreed to seek releases from the lessors and vendors in favor of healthsouth with respect to the guarantee obligations associated with these divestitures 
to the extent the purchasers of these divisions are unable to obtain releases for healthsouth  the purchasers have agreed to indemnify healthsouth for damages incurred under the guarantee obligations  if any 
for additional information regarding these guarantees  see note  guarantees  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
also  as discussed in note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  our securities litigation settlement agreement requires us to indemnify the settling insurance carriers  to the extent permitted by law  for any amounts they are legally obligated to pay to any non settling defendants 
as of december   we have not recorded a liability regarding these indemnifications  as we do not believe it is probable we will have to perform under the indemnification portion of these settlement agreements  and any amount we would be required to pay is not estimable at this time 
as of december   we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above 
as of december   we hold two derivative financial instruments  as defined by fasb statement no 
the first is an interest rate swap that is not designated as a hedge 
it was entered into under the requirements of our credit agreement in march the second is a forward starting interest rate swap that is designated as a cash flow hedge 
we entered into this swap to hedge the cash flow of future interest payments associated with our term loan facility 
see note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding both of these interest rate swaps 
as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
contractual obligations our consolidated contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in millions total and thereafter long term debt obligations long term debt  excluding revolving credit facility and capital lease obligations a revolving credit facility interest on long term debt b capital lease obligations c operating lease obligations d e purchase obligations e f other long term liabilities g total a included in long term debt are amounts owed on our bonds payable and notes payable to banks and others 
these borrowings are further explained in note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
b interest on our fixed rate debt is presented using the stated interest rate 
interest expense on our variable rate debt is estimated using the rate in effect as of december  interest related to capital lease obligations is excluded from this line 
amounts exclude amortization of debt discounts  amortization of loan fees  or fees for lines of credit that would be included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
amounts also exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps 
c amounts include interest portion of future minimum capital lease payments 
d we lease many of our hospitals as well as other property and equipment under operating leases in the normal course of business 
some of our hospital leases require percentage rentals on patient revenues above specified minimums and contain escalation clauses 
the minimum lease payments do not include contingent rental expense 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
for more information  see note  property and equipment  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  as of december   these amounts exclude approximately million of operating lease obligations associated with facilities that are reported in discontinued operations 
e future operating lease obligations and purchase obligations are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
f purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on healthsouth and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
our purchase obligations primarily relate to software licensing and support  medical supplies  certain equipment  and telecommunications 
g because their future cash outflows are uncertain  the following noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the table above medical malpractice and workers compensation risks  deferred income taxes  and our estimated liability for unsettled litigation 
for more information  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  self insured risks  note  income taxes  and note  contingencies and other commitments  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
also  at december  and in accordance with the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  we had approximately million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits 
in addition  we had an accrual for related interest income of million as of december  we continue to actively pursue the maximization of our remaining state income tax refund claims 
the process of resolving these tax matters with the applicable taxing authorities will continue in at this time  we cannot estimate a range of the reasonably possible change that may occur 
indemnifications in the ordinary course of business  healthsouth enters into contractual arrangements under which healthsouth may agree to indemnify another party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of healthsouth or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract  which may include  for example  litigation or claims relating to past performance 
such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
pursuant to an indemnity agreement with richard m 
scrushy  our former chairman and chief executive officer  we may have an obligation to indemnify mr 
scrushy for certain costs associated with ongoing litigation 
advances made by the company are subject to repayment by mr 
scrushy if it is ultimately determined that mr 
scrushy is not entitled to be indemnified against such expenses and costs by the company pursuant to this agreement or otherwise 
further  pursuant to the terms of the securities litigation settlement see note  settlements  of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  mr 
scrushy s indemnification claims are limited because the securities litigation settlement bars claims by the defendants arising out of or relating to the stockholder securities action and the bondholder securities action 
an appeal of this order by mr 
scrushy is currently outstanding with the eleventh circuit court of appeals 
as of december  and december   an estimate of these legal fees is included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  in connection with the divestitures of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions  we have certain post closing indemnification obligations to the respective purchasers 
these indemnification obligations arose from liabilities not assumed by the purchasers  such as certain types of litigation  any breach by us of the purchase agreements  liabilities associated with assets that were excluded from the divestitures  and other types of liabilities that are customary in transactions of these types 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgment that affects the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates  and judgments on historical experience  current trends  and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates  and judgments to ensure our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  as they require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize net patient service revenues in the reporting period in which we perform the service based on our current billing rates ie  gross charges  less actual adjustments and estimated discounts for contractual allowances principally for patients covered by medicare  medicaid  and managed care and other health plans 
we record gross service charges in our accounting records on an accrual basis using our established rates for the type of service provided to the patient 
we recognize an estimated contractual allowance to reduce gross patient charges to the amount we estimate we will actually realize for the service rendered based upon previously agreed to rates with a payor 
our patient accounting system calculates contractual allowances on a patient by patient basis based on the rates in effect for each primary third party payor 
other factors that are considered and could further influence the level of our reserves include the patient s total length of stay for in house patients  the proportion of patients with secondary insurance coverage and the level of reimbursement under that secondary coverage  and the amount of charges that will be disallowed by payors 
such additional factors are assumed to remain consistent with the experience for patients discharged in similar time periods for the same payor classes  and additional reserves are provided to account for these factors  accordingly 
payors include federal and state agencies  including medicare and medicaid  managed care health plans  commercial insurance companies  employers  and patients 
management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms that result from contract renegotiations and renewals 
in addition  laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
due to complexities involved in determining amounts ultimately due under reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  which are often subject to interpretation  we may receive reimbursement for healthcare services authorized and provided that is different from our estimates  and such differences could be material 
however  we continually review the amounts actually collected in subsequent periods in order to determine the amounts by which our estimates differed 
historically  such differences have not been material from either a quantitative or qualitative perspective 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
the collection of outstanding receivables from medicare  managed care payors  other third party payors  and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance 
the primary collection risks relate to patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement  but patient responsibility amounts deductibles and co payments remain outstanding 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable  our historical collection experience for each type of payor  and other relevant factors so that the remaining receivables  net of allowances  are reflected at their estimated net realizable values 
accounts requiring collection efforts are reviewed each days via system generated work queues that automatically stage accounts requiring collection efforts for patient account representatives 
collection efforts include contacting the applicable party both in writing and by telephone  providing information both financial and clinical to allow for payment or to overturn payor decisions to deny payment  and arranging payment plans with self pay patients  among other techniques 
when we determine that all in house efforts have been exhausted or that it is a more prudent use of resources  accounts may be turned over to a collection agency 
accounts are written off after all collection efforts internal and external have been exhausted 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
however  we continually review the amounts actually collected in subsequent periods in order to determine the amounts by which our estimates differed 
historically  such differences have not been material from either a quantitative or qualitative perspective 
adverse changes in general economic conditions  business office operations  payor mix  or trends in federal or state governmental and private employer healthcare coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
the table below shows a summary aging of our net accounts receivable balance as of december  and information on the concentration of total patient accounts receivable by payor class can be found in note  summary of significant accounting policies  accounts receivable  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of december  in millions days days days days days patient accounts receivable non patient accounts receivable accounts receivable  net self insured risks we are self insured for certain losses related to professional liability  general liability  and workers compensation risks 
although we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims  a substantial portion of our professional liability and workers compensation risks are insured through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary 
obligations covered by reinsurance contracts remain on the balance sheet as the subsidiary remains liable to the extent reinsurers do not meet their obligations 
our reserves and provisions for professional liability and workers compensation risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates calculated by third party actuaries 
the actuaries consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience  exposure data  loss development  and geography 
periodically  management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by third party actuaries to determine the adequacy of our self insured liabilities 
changes to the estimated reserve amounts are included in current operating results 
all reserves are undiscounted 
our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
the reserves for professional liability and workers compensation risks cover approximately  individual claims as of december  and estimates for potential unreported claims 
the time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated 
the estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly 
due to the considerable variability that is inherent in such estimates  there can be no assurance the ultimate liability will not exceed management s estimates 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets contained in our financial statements may not be recoverable 
when evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges  unless there is an offer to purchase such assets  which would be the basis for determining fair value 
we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset will be its new cost basis 
for a depreciable long lived asset  the new cost basis will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
restoration of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited 
our impairment loss calculations require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that represents the risk inherent in future cash flows 
using the impairment review methodology described herein  we recorded long lived asset impairment charges of million in continuing operations and million in discontinued operations during the year ended december  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies 
we follow the guidance in fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and test goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach  at the reporting unit level 
we are required to test for impairment at least annually  absent some triggering event that would accelerate an impairment assessment 
on an ongoing basis  absent any impairment indicators  we perform our goodwill impairment testing as of october st of each year 
we determine the fair value of our reporting unit using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
we performed our annual testing for goodwill impairment as of october   using the methodology described herein  and determined no goodwill impairment existed 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to additional goodwill impairment charges 
our other intangible assets consist of acquired certificates of need  licenses  noncompete agreements  and market access assets 
we amortize these assets over their respective estimated useful lives  which typically range from to years 
all of our other intangible assets are amortized using the straight line basis  except for our market access assets  which are amortized using an accelerated basis see below 
as of december   we do not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
we continue to review the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets whenever facts and circumstances change in a manner that indicates their carrying values may not be recoverable 
the fair value of our other intangible assets is determined using discounted cash flows and significant unobservable inputs 
our market access assets are valued using discounted cash flows under the income approach 
the value of the market access assets is attributable to our ability to gain access to and penetrate the former facility s historical market patient base 
to determine this value  we first develop a debt free net cash flow forecast under various patient volume scenarios 
the debt free net cash flow is then discounted back to present value using a discount factor  which includes an adjustment for company specific risk 
we amortize these assets over years using an accelerated basis that reflects the pattern in which we believe the economic benefits of the market access assets will be consumed 
share based payments fasb statement no 
r requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair value 
for our stock options  the fair value is estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model with weighted average assumptions for the activity under our stock plans 
for our restricted stock awards that contain a service condition and or a performance condition  fair value is based on our closing stock price on the grant date 
we use a monte carlo approach to the binomial model to measure fair value for restricted stock that vests upon the achievement of a service condition and a market condition 
inputs into the model include the historical price volatility of our common stock  the historical volatility of the common stock of the companies in the defined peer group  and the risk free interest rate 
utilizing these inputs and potential future changes in stock prices  multiple trials are run to determine the fair value 
option pricing model assumptions such as expected term  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends  impact the fair value estimate 
further  the forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation expense recorded in each year 
these assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
when estimating fair value  some of the assumptions will be based on or determined from external data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical experience with share based payment arrangements 
the appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment based on relevant facts and circumstances 
we estimate our expected term through an analysis of actual  historical post vesting exercise  cancellation  and expiration behavior by our employees and projected post vesting activity of outstanding options 
we currently calculate volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the period commensurate with the expected life of the options  excluding a distinct period of extreme volatility between and the risk free interest rate is the implied daily yield currently available on us treasury issues with a remaining term closely approximating the expected term used as the input to the black scholes option pricing model 
we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock  and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
therefore  we do not include a dividend payment as part of our pricing model 
we estimate forfeitures through an analysis of actual  historical pre vesting option forfeiture activity 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to expense adjustments that could be material to our results of operations 
compensation expense related to performance based awards may vary each reporting period based on changes in the expected achievement of performance measures 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
in addition  deferred tax assets are also recorded with respect to net operating losses and other tax attribute carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when realization of the benefit of deferred tax assets is not deemed to be more likely than not 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
on january  the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
the ultimate recovery of certain of our deferred tax assets is dependent on the amount and timing of taxable income that we will ultimately generate in the future and other factors 
a high degree of judgment is required to determine the extent that valuation allowances should be provided against deferred tax assets 
we have provided valuation allowances at december  aggregating approximately billion against such assets based on our current assessment of future operating results and other factors 
we continue to actively pursue the maximization of our remaining state income tax refund claims 
the actual amount of the refunds will not be finally determined until all of the applicable taxing authorities have completed their review 
although management believes its estimates and judgments related to these claims are reasonable  depending on the ultimate resolution of these tax matters  actual amounts recovered could differ from management s estimates  and such differences could be material 
assessment of loss contingencies we have legal and other contingencies that could result in significant losses upon the ultimate resolution of such contingencies 
we have provided for losses in situations where we have concluded it is probable a loss has been or will be incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining whether a loss is probable and reasonably estimable due to the uncertainty involved in determining the likelihood of future events and estimating the financial statement impact of such events 
if further developments or resolution of a contingent matter are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may need to recognize a significant charge in a future period related to an existing contingent matter 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  business combinations 
fasb statement no 
r contains significant changes in the accounting for and reporting of business acquisitions  and it continues the movement toward the greater use of fair values in financial reporting and increased transparency through expanded disclosures 
it changes how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements at the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
further  certain of the changes will introduce more volatility into earnings and thus may impact a company s acquisition strategy 
in addition  fasb statement no 
r will impact the annual goodwill impairment test associated with acquisitions that close both before and after the effective date of the new standard 
fasb statement no 
r will be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of an entity s first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   or january  for healthsouth 
we do not expect the adoption of fasb statement no 
r to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
fasb statement no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for minority interests recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
fasb statement no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   or january  for healthsouth 
the statement is to be applied prospectively  however  the presentation and disclosure requirements of the statement will need to be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
we do not expect the adoption of fasb statement no 
to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  it will change the way in which we account for and report minority interests 
in march  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
fasb statement no 
is intended to help investors better understand how derivative instruments and hedging activities affect an entity s financial position  operations  and cash flows through enhanced disclosure requirements 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   or january  for healthsouth 
the adoption of this statement will result only in additional disclosures in our interim and annual reports beginning with the first quarter of no impact is expected on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
this fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fasb statement no 
the intent of this fsp is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fasb statement no 
and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under fasb statement no 
r and other gaap 
this fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  or january  for healthsouth 
the guidance within the fsp for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset will be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
the additional disclosure requirements of the fsp will be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of  and subsequent to  the effective date 
we do not expect the adoption of this fsp to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock 
the primary objective of eitf is to provide guidance for determining whether an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock  which is a key criterion of the scope exception to paragraph a of fasb statement no 
and is also an important consideration for evaluating whether eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  applies to certain financial instruments that are not derivatives under fasb statement no 
under this guidance  financial instruments or embedded features that were not historically considered to be indexed to an entity s own stock could be required to be classified as an asset or liability and marked to market through earnings in each reporting period 
eitf issue no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   or january  for healthsouth  and must be applied to all instruments outstanding as of the effective date 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
we do not believe any other recently issued  but not yet effective  accounting standards will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
for additional information regarding recent account pronouncements  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is to changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
we use sensitivity analysis models to evaluate the impact of interest rate changes on these items 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates impacts the net fair value of our fixed rate debt but has no impact on interest expense or cash flows 
interest rate changes on variable rate debt impacts our interest expense and cash flows  but does not impact the net fair value of the underlying debt instruments 
our fixed and variable rate debt excluding capital lease obligations and notes payable to banks and others as of december  is shown in the following table in millions as of december  carrying amount of total estimated fair value of total fixed rate debt variable rate debt total long term debt as discussed in more detail in note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  in march  we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert the floating rate of a portion of our credit agreement to a fixed rate in order to limit the variability of interest related payments caused by changes in libor 
under this interest rate swap agreement  we pay a fixed rate of on an amortizing notional principal of billion  while the counterparties to this interest rate swap agreement pay a floating rate based on month libor 
as of december   the fair market value of this interest rate swap approximated million 
the termination date of this swap is march  based on the variable rate of our debt as of december  and inclusive of the impact of the conversion of billion of variable rate interest to a fixed rate via an interest rate swap  as discussed above  a increase in interest rates would result in an incremental negative cash flow of approximately million over the next months  while a decrease in interest rates would result in an incremental positive cash flow of approximately million over the next twelve months 
a increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the estimated net fair value of our fixed rate debt  and a decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate million increase in its estimated net fair value 
our variable interest payments increase or decrease in accordance with changes in interest rates 
however  the vast majority of the variation in these payments will be offset by net settlement payments or receipts  which are included in the line item loss on interest rate swap in our consolidated statements of operations  on the interest rate swap described above 
per the underlying swap agreement  the notional amount of this interest rate swap is scheduled to decrease from billion as of december  to billion in march in december  we entered into a million forward starting interest rate swap that is designated as a cash flow hedge 
see note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information 
foreign operations  and the related market risks associated with foreign currencies  are currently  and have been  insignificant to our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows
