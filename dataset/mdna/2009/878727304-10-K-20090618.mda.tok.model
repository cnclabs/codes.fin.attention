royalty income increased to 
million from 
million 
our military business increased million or from the prior year 
our gross profit in fiscal increased million to million from million in the prior year 
the increased margin is principally due to the prior fiscal year gross margin including a million write down in inventory and loss on purchase commitments and the current year including a million gain on the disposition of this inventory and settlement of purchase obligations with one of our contract manufacturers 
after adjusting the gross margins in fiscal and for these items  gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to from in the prior year principally due to the revenue mix between military and commercial business

other income  net  increased million from income of million to income of million primarily as the result of payments received as part of a legal settlement 
overview we are an internationally recognized leader in the design  manufacture and sale of electrical safety products 
we market and sell our products through several channels of distribution including our in house sales force  retail  distribution  domestic and international oems and third party sales representation organizations 
we recognize revenue from equipment sales when evidence of a sales arrangement exists  pricing is fixed or determinable  delivery  including title passage has taken place  and collectability from the customer is reasonably assured 
amounts billed to customers in sales transactions related to shipping and handling are classified as product revenue 
royalty revenue is recognized when reported by licensees 
our gross margins are affected by many different factors including competitive price pressures  product mix  differences in manufacturing volumes  changes in the cost of raw materials  charges for excess or obsolete inventory  and costs of warranty repairs 
we generally provide a one year warranty on product sales 
we believe that our accrued warranty is adequate to cover the cost of future warranty work on products we have sold 
selling and marketing expenses include salaries  bonuses  commissions and related employee expenses for sales personnel  advertising  promotional and trade show expenses  travel  consulting fees  and facilities expense 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries  bonuses and related employee expenses  travel  consulting fees  facilities expense  legal and audit  charge offs of bad debts and board of director fees 
research and development expenses principally include salaries for engineers and technical support staff  consulting  outside testing service fees  maintenance contracts on software  and depreciation of engineering equipment 
results of operations the following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of revenue for each of the periods shown revenue commercial military royalties total revenue cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative research and development business restructuring charges other total operating expenses income loss from operations interest expense other income income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income fiscal and comparison revenue for fiscal decreased million  or to million from million for the prior fiscal year 
commercial revenue decreased million to million from million 
royalty income increased to 
million from 
million 
military revenue increased million or to million from million in fiscal the recent extreme volatility and disruption of financial markets in the united states  europe and asia and depressed conditions in the real estate market have all contributed to weakening worldwide economic conditions and have contributed to a reduction in revenue in our commercial business 
the decline in commercial revenue was principally a result of a continuing decline in rac revenue due to competition from off shore  low cost manufacturers and the impact of the recession on several of our major markets  including rv and industrial construction 
the increase in military revenue was attributable to increased demand after supplemental government funding became available during the current fiscal year 
gross profit increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the higher fiscal gross profit was primarily due to a fiscal write down of inventory to lower of cost or market and a loss on purchase commitments in total amounting to million resulting from the steep decline in demand for rac products 
additionally  in fiscal  we recognized a million gain on the disposition of this inventory and settlement of purchase obligations with one of our contract manufacturers 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased percentage points from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to the items previously discussed 
after adjusting the gross margins in fiscal and for these items  gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to from in the prior year principally due to the revenue mix between military and commercial business 
selling and marketing expense of million in fiscal increased 
million or from million in fiscal the 
million increase from the prior year was primarily due to an increase in military marketing 
selling and marketing expense as a percent of revenue increased to of revenue from in fiscal principally due to the significant decrease in commercial revenue 
we expect selling and marketing expense to decrease approximately million in fiscal general and administrative expense increased 
million or to million for fiscal from million in the prior year 
the increase from the prior year was principally due to increased professional fees and obligations incurred from the retirement of our chief financial officer and increased professional fees 
general and administrative expense as a percent of revenue increased from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to the increase in general and administrative expenses discussed above and the lower revenue in fiscal research and development expense of million increased in fiscal from million in fiscal research and development expense as a percent of revenue increased to from in the prior year 
the increase in research and development expense from the prior year period is primarily due to an increased headcount in engineering development and consulting related expenses as we added resources to improve our engineering expertise 
we expect research and development expense to increase approximately million in fiscal other income expense  net was million of income in fiscal versus million of income in fiscal  an increase in income of million 
the increase in other income was primarily attributable to payments received as part of a legal settlement 
in addition  interest expense declined from the prior year due to the repayment of all borrowings in fiscal income tax expense increased 
million to 
million from a benefit of 
million in fiscal the increase was due to lower income in fiscal as well as the jurisdictional source where the income was earned 
our us income was eliminated due to the large write down in inventory to market value and the increased loss on purchase commitments resulting in the only income we earned in fiscal being earned in honduras where there is no income tax 
income tax expense as a percent of income before income taxes was in fiscal  compared with in fiscal historically  our effective tax rate has varied based on the mix of income before income taxes derived from our honduran subsidiary  which had not been subject to income taxes  and the balance of income before income taxes derived in the united states  which is subject to income taxes 
our honduran subsidiary is profitable which decreases our effective tax rate 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  we do not record deferred income taxes on the foreign undistributed earnings of an investment in a foreign subsidiary that are essentially permanent in duration 
net income was million for fiscal  compared with million reported in fiscal  an increase of million 
gross profit in fiscal was million higher than fiscal and other income was million higher than the prior year  but these income increases were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of million 
fiscal and comparison revenue for fiscal decreased 
million  or to million from million for the prior fiscal year 
commercial revenues decreased million due to a sharp decrease in rac revenue 
military revenue increased million or to million from million in fiscal the decline in commercial revenue was principally a result of declining rac revenue due to competition from off shore  low cost manufacturers 
the increase in military revenue was attributable to increased demand after government funding became available near the end of the prior fiscal year 
gross profit increased 
million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the higher fiscal gross profit was primarily due to the sale of products with higher gross profit margins product mix 
the fiscal write down of inventory to lower of cost or market and the increased loss on purchase commitments in total amounting to million as compared to million in fiscal was due to the steep decline in demand for rac products 
the 
million increase in inventory write down and loss on purchase commitments negatively impacted fiscal s gross profit versus the prior year 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase in gross profit as a percent of revenue is also primarily due to the change in sales mix 
selling and marketing expense of million  or of revenue  decreased 
million in fiscal from million or of revenue in fiscal the 
million decrease from the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense 
selling and marketing expense as a percent of revenue decreased 
principally due to the 
million decrease in selling and marketing expenses 
general and administrative expense declined 
million or of revenue to million or of revenue for fiscal the decrease from the prior year was principally due to 
million in lower professional fees and 
million in lower write offs of bad debts partially offset by 
million in higher compensation related expenses  and 
in higher employee related expenses 
the reduction in professional fees is due to the settlement of our patent infringement lawsuit with the tower manufacturing corporation in december general and administrative expense as a percent of revenue decreased 
from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to the decrease in general and administrative expenses discussed above 
research and development expense of million or of revenue in fiscal declined 
million from million  or of revenue in fiscal restructuring charges were 
million in fiscal versus 
in fiscal in march  we reduced our us workforce by approximately in order to adjust our cost structure to be more competitive due to the loss of rac revenue 
there were no comparable restructuring charges in fiscal other operating expenses consisted of 
million in fiscal compared with 
in fiscal other operating expense in fiscal consisted of a write down of assets to fair value 
other income expense  net was 
million of income in fiscal versus million of income in fiscal  a decrease in income of million 
the decrease in other income was primarily attributable to the patent infringement lawsuit settlement of million that was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  interest expense declined from the prior year due to the repayment of all borrowings in fiscal income tax expense decreased 
million to 
million of benefit in fiscal the decrease was due to lower income in fiscal as well as the jurisdictional source where the income was earned 
our us income was eliminated due to the large write down in inventory to market value and the increased loss on purchase commitments resulting in the only income we earned in fiscal being earned in honduras where there is no income tax 
income tax expense as a percent of income before income taxes was in fiscal  compared with in fiscal historically  our effective tax rate has varied based on the mix of income before income taxes derived from our honduran subsidiary  which had not been subject to income taxes  and the balance of income before income taxes derived in the united states  which is subject to income taxes 
our honduran subsidiary is profitable which decreases our effective tax rate 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  we do not record deferred income taxes on the foreign undistributed earnings of an investment in a foreign subsidiary that are essentially permanent in duration 
net income was 
million for fiscal  compared with million reported in fiscal  a decrease of million 
although gross profit in fiscal was 
million higher than fiscal and operating expenses were 
million lower resulting in million higher operating income in fiscal  we had million lower other income in fiscal  because there was no comparable million settlement in connection with a patent infringement lawsuit as had occurred in fiscal critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures  in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles  requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes i we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and ii different estimates that we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimates actually used resulting from events that could be reasonably foreseen as likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements once known 
in addition  we are periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within our control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled disclosure regarding forward looking statements and in section item a above  entitled risk factors 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  we believe that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles and present a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that the following are critical accounting policies revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts 
we recognize revenue from commercial customers when an order has been received and accepted  pricing is fixed  delivery has occurred and title to the product has passed and collectability is reasonably assured 
title generally passes upon shipment to the customer  however  in a limited number of cases  title passes upon receipt of shipment by the customer 
we have no installation obligation subsequent to product shipment 
similarly  revenue from sales to distributors are recognized as title passes to them without additional involvement or obligation 
collection of receivables related to distributor sales is not contingent upon subsequent sales to third parties 
royalty revenue is recognized as reported by licensees 
we may enter into government contracts that fall within the scope of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop non standard products or fall outside the scope of sop standard products 
for government contracts within the scope of sop  we record revenue under a units of delivery model with revenue and costs equal to the average unit value times the number of units delivered 
any estimated loss on an overall contract would be recognized in the period determined in accordance with sop for government contracts outside the scope of sop  we record revenue the same as for commercial customers discussed above and would record a loss in the event the costs to fulfill a government contract are in excess of the associated revenue 
we have not experienced past losses on government contracts  and currently  we do not have any transactions being accounted for within the scope of sop we record an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make timely payments of amounts due on account of product purchases 
we assess the credit worthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information  including publicly available credit data  subscription based credit reports  trade association data  and analyzes factors such as historical bad debt experience  changes in customer payment terms or payment patterns  credit risk related to industry and geographical location and economic trends 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers were to worsen  additional write offs could be required  resulting in write offs not included in our current allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories 
because of the lead times required to obtain certain raw materials  we must maintain sufficient quantities on hand to meet expected product demand for each of our many products 
if actual demand is much lower than forecasted  we may not be able to dispose of our inventory at or above our cost 
we write down our inventory for estimated excess and obsolete amounts to the lower of cost or market 
we review the reasonableness of our estimates each quarter or more frequently 
a write down is established for inventory that has had no activity for long periods of time or for which management believes is no longer salable 
this write down is reviewed and approved by the senior management team 
in the future  based on our quarterly analysis  if we estimate that any remaining write down for obsolescence is inadequate  we may need to adjust it 
at present  based on our analysis  we believe the write down amount is properly valued for the inventory held by us 
income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of any accrual for tax contingencies  any foreign withholding taxes or any united states income taxes on undistributed earnings of the foreign subsidiary  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required to be applied against the deferred tax assets 
it had been management s intention to reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary and thereby indefinitely postpone their repatriation 
accordingly  prior to fiscal no provision had been made for foreign withholding taxes or united states income taxes which would become payable if undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary are paid to us as dividends 
in fiscal and fiscal  pursuant to sections and of the internal revenue code  approximately million of current year and prior undistributed earnings of our subsidiary in honduras were deemed dividends to the parent company and subject to us income tax 
accordingly a provision was recorded for all of the taxes attributable to these deemed dividends in fiscal and fiscal the circumstances that triggered the taxation of our foreign earnings no longer exist and it is our intention to reinvest future undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary and thereby indefinitely postpone their repatriation 
we apply the comparable profits method for transfer pricing to determine the amounts our subsidiary charges to the parent 
warranty 
we generally provide a one year warranty period for our products 
we also provide coverage on certain of our surge products for downstream damage of products not manufactured by us 
our warranty provision represents our estimate of probable liabilities  calculated as a function of sales volume and historical repair experience for each product under warranty 
our warranty accrual represents our estimate of our liability for warranty repairs that we will incur over the warranty period 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for possible impairment of carrying value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefit of our assets  management performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows to be derived from the use of individual assets over their remaining amortization period 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its anticipated undiscounted cash flows  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between its carrying value and its fair value 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility and expected option life 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to compensation cost may be required in future periods 
the discussion below contains forward looking statements about our expectations of what could happen in the future 
forward looking statements involve uncertainties and risk and our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward looking statements due to many known and unknown factors  including but not limited to those previously discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
see also the cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of this form k under the heading disclosures regarding forward looking statements
