item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide an overview of the significant factors affecting the financial condition and the results of operations of the corporation and its subsidiaries for the year ended december  and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with this discussion and analysis 
forward looking statements in addition to historical information  this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein  including documents incorporated by reference  that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
examples of forward looking statements include discussions as to our expectations  beliefs  plans  goals  objectives and future financial or other performance or assumptions concerning matters discussed in this document 
forward looking statements often use words such as believes  expects  plans  may  will  should  projects  contemplates  anticipates  forecasts  intends or other words of similar meaning 
you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions  risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from historical results or those anticipated by such statements 
factors that could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the corporation include  but are not limited to  changes in continued deterioration in general business and economic conditions and in the financial markets and the impact of any policies or programs implemented pursuant to the eesa  branch expansion plans  interest rates  general economic conditions  monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the comptroller  us treasury and the frb  the economy of northern virginia  including governmental spending and real estate markets  the quality or composition of the loan or investment portfolios  demand for loan products  deposit flows  competition  and accounting principles  policies and guidelines

any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made  and we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made 
for additional discussion of risk factors that may cause our actual future results to differ materially from the results indicated within forward looking statements  please see item a risk factors herein 
in addition  a continuation of the recent turbulence in significant portions of the global financial markets  particularly if it worsens  could impact our performance  both directly by affecting our revenues and the value of our assets and liabilities  and indirectly by affecting our counterparties and the economy generally 
dramatic declines in the housing market in the past year have resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions in the united states 
concerns about the stability of the us financial markets generally have reduced the availability of funding to certain financial institutions  leading to a tightening of credit  reduction of business activity  and increased market volatility 
there can be no assurance that the eesa  the arra or the actions taken by the us treasury will stabilize the us financial system or alleviate the industry or economic factors that may adversely affect our business 
in addition  our business and financial performance could be impacted as the financial industry restructures in the current environment  both by changes in the creditworthiness and performance of our counterparties and by changes in the competitive landscape 
critical accounting policies the corporation s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing the corporation s financial statements management makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the most significant subjective judgments that it makes include the following allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principals of accounting i statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimatable and ii sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
an allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based upon industry standards  known risk characteristics  and management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activity 
such evaluation considers among other factors  the estimated market value of the underlying collateral  and current economic conditions 
for further information about our practices with respect to allowance for loan losses  please see the subsection loans below 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities the bank s investment portfolio is classified as available for sale 
the estimated fair value of the portfolio fluctuates due to changes in market interest rates and other factors 
changes in estimated fair value are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income 
securities are monitored to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
management evaluates the investment portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine the collectability of amounts due per the contractual terms of the investment security 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
at december  there were no securities with other than temporary impairment 
income taxes the corporation uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
this method results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities that are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes 
the deferred provision for income taxes is the result of the net change in the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances during the year 
this amount combined with the current taxes payable or refundable results in the income tax expense for the current year 
fair value fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions 
fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates  credit risk  prepayments and other factors  especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items 
changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates 
the fair value estimates of existing on and off balance sheet financial instruments do not include the value of anticipated future business or the values of assets and liabilities not considered financial instruments 
for additional information about our financial assets carried at fair value  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition summary the corporation completed its ninth year of operation and recorded net income of million 
total assets at december  were million compared to million in the increase in total assets is primarily due to a million increase in loans held for sale  a million increase in securities  and an increase in loans held for investment of approximately million 
the following discussions by major categories explain the changes in financial condition 
investment securities the corporation s securities portfolio is comprised of us treasury securities  us government agency securities  municipal securities  cra mutual fund  mortgage backed securities and frb and fhlb stock 
the investment portfolio is used to provide liquidity and as a tool for managing interest sensitivity in the balance sheet  while generating a reasonable return 
at december  the estimated fair value of the securities portfolio totaled million  up from million in the increase is due to a decline in loan demand 
all securities were classified as available for sale 
the financial accounting standards board fasb requires that securities classified as available for sale be accounted for at fair market value 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded directly to a separate component of stockholders equity 
the corporation s securities classified as available for sale had an unrealized gain net of deferred taxes of thousand on december  the following tables present the types  amounts and maturity distribution of the securities portfolio 
investment securities available for sale in thousands december investment securities available for sale us treasury notes us government agency mortgage backed tax exempt municipals taxable municipals cra mutual fund restricted stock total securities carried at cost maturity schedule of investment securities available for sale dollars in thousands after one year after five years after ten years within but within but within and one year five years ten years over total amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield investment securities available for sale us treasury notes us government agency mortgage backed tax exempt municipals taxable municipals total excludes cra mutual fund  frb stock and fhlb stock loans loans held for investment totaled million at december  up from million at december   an increase of million after charge offs of approximately million and transferring approximately million to oreo 
the rate of loan growth in was significantly below that of prior years largely due to a decline in loan demand  reflecting the current economic environment  and more restrictive underwriting standards 
credit quality of the portfolio remains high with only five loans classified as non performing 
commercial loans increased by approximately million from last year 
loans secured by commercial real estate increased million  a increase over the growth in commercial real estate loans reflects our continuing commitment to local owner occupied commercial financing 
real estate construction loans decreased million  a decrease over last year 
this loan category is comprised of both construction and land development loans 
residential real estate loans decreased million from million in to million in consumer loans totaled million in and million in the bank offers a complete line of consumer lending products  primarily as a service to the affiliates of our commercial and professional clients 
the bank does not actively market its consumer products at this time  which accounts for the nominal amount of consumer loans 
the bank concentrates on providing banking services to small to medium sized businesses and professionals in our market area 
our loan officers maintain a professional relationship with our clients and are responsive to their financial needs 
they are directly involved in the community and it is this involvement and commitment that leads to referrals and continued growth 
loans held for sale totaled million at december  compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the increase in loans held for sale is due to a decrease in rates and an increase in loans being refinanced 
loan origination volume including brokered loans totaled billion in compared to million in  a decrease

both properties are in the process of being liquidated 
the level of the allowance for loan losses is determined by management through an ongoing detailed analysis of risk and loss potential within the portfolio as a whole and they have concluded the amount of our reserve and the methodology applied to arrive at the amount of the reserve is justified and appropriate 
outside of our own analysis  our reserve adequacy and methodology are reviewed on a regular basis by an internal audit program  and bank regulators and such reviews have not resulted in any material adjustment to the reserve 
the schedule below  allocation of the allowance for loan losses  reflects the pro rata allocation by the different loan types 
the methodology as to how the allowance was derived is a combination of specific allocations and percentage allocations of the allowance for loan losses  as discussed below 
the bank has developed a comprehensive risk weighting system based on individual loan characteristics that enables the bank to allocate the composition of the allowance for loan losses by types of loans 
the methodology as to how the allowance was derived is detailed below 
adequacy of the allowance is assessed monthly and increased by provisions charged to expense 
charge offs are taken  no less frequently than at the close of each fiscal quarter 
the methodology by which we systematically determine the amount of our allowance is set forth by the board of directors in our credit policy  pursuant to which our chief credit officer is charged with ensuring that each loan is individually evaluated and the portfolio characteristics are evaluated to arrive at an appropriate aggregate reserve 
the results of the analysis are documented  reviewed and approved by the board of directors no less than quarterly 
the following elements are considered in this analysis loss estimates on specific problem credits  individual loan risk ratings  lending staff changes  loan review and board oversight  loan policies and procedures  portfolio trends with respect to volume  delinquency  composition concentrations of credit  risk rating migration  levels of classified credit  off balance sheet credit exposure  any other factors considered relevant from time to time 
all loans are graded or risk rated individually for loss potential at the time of origination and as warranted thereafter  but no less frequently than quarterly 
loss potential factors are applied based upon a blend of the following criteria our own direct experience at this bank  our collective management experience in administering similar loan portfolios in the market for nearly years  and peer data contained in statistical releases issued by both the comptroller and the fdic 
although looking only at peer data and the bank s historically low write offs would suggest a lower loan loss allowance  our management s experience with similar portfolios in the same market combined with the fact that our portfolio is relatively unseasoned  justify a conservative approach in contemplating external statistical resources 
accordingly  management s collective experience at this bank and other banks is the most heavily weighted criterion  and the weighting is subjective and varies by loan type  amount  collateral  structure  and repayment terms 
prevailing economic conditions generally and within each individual borrower s business sector are considered  as well as any changes in the borrower s own financial position and  in the case of commercial loans  management structure and business operations 
when deterioration develops in an individual credit  the loan is placed on a watch list and the loan is monitored more closely 
all loans on the watch list are evaluated for specific loss potential based upon either an evaluation of the liquidated value of the collateral or cash flow deficiencies 
if management believes that  with respect to a specific loan  an impaired source of repayment  collateral impairment or a change in a debtor s financial condition presents a heightened risk of loss  the loan is classified as impaired and the book balance of the loan is reduced to the expected liquidation value by charging the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the reserves discussed above  the mortgage corporation maintains a separate reserve in other liabilities for potential early payoff and fraud default penalties 
at december  the balance in this reserve totaled approximately million 
the following tables present an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated

the accrual of interest is discontinued at the time the loan is days delinquent unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection 
when a loan is placed on non accrual  unpaid interest is reversed against interest income 
subsequent receipts on non accrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured 
the loss potential for each loan has been evaluated and in management s opinion the risk of loss is adequately reserved against 
management actively works with the borrowers to maximize the potential for repayment and reports on the status to the board of directors  no less than on a monthly basis 
deposits deposits totaled million at december  and were comprised of non interest bearing demand deposits in the amount of million  savings and interest bearing deposits in the amount of million and time deposits in the amount of million 
total deposits increased approximately million over december   an increase of 
non interest bearing deposits increased million from million at december  to million at december  this increase is due to a combination of balance fluctuations in existing commercial accounts and new accounts 
savings and interest bearing deposit accounts decreased million from million at december  to million at december  this decrease occurred primarily in money market accounts due to a decrease in rates that caused customers to move to higher yielding accounts at other banks or time deposits at our bank 
time deposits increased million and totaled million at december  compared to million in our customer service focus is mainly on our business and professional customers  which usually generate more referrals for additional new business than do retail account holders 
brokered or wholesale deposits included in time deposits totaled million and million at december  and respectively 
brokered deposits include million and at december  and respectively  in certificates of deposits enrolled in the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars 
through cdars depositors are able to obtain fdic insurance of up to million 
together with fhlb borrowings we use brokered deposits to fund the short term cash needs associated with lhfs program discussed under loans as well as other funding needs

banking regulators have defined minimum regulatory capital ratios that the corporation and the bank are required to maintain 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by the banking regulators  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off the balance sheet 
both the corporation and bank are classified as well capitalized  which is the highest rating

interest and dividend income decreased million from million in to million in the decrease in interest income was largely due to lower yields on loans as a result of the prime rate decreasing from at the beginning of the year and ending the year at 
approximately of the bank s loans have variable interest rates 
interest expense decreased million from million in to million in the decrease in interest expense was due to a million decrease in average borrowed funds and lower interest rates paid on deposit accounts 
non interest income increased million in as a result of increased gains on the sale of loans 
non interest expense decreased approximately million as other operating expenses declined 
net income totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from million in diluted earnings per share for were

the other significant factor impacting income in was an increase in the allowance for loan losses of million due to the million growth in loans held for investment 
net interest income net interest income  the principal source of bank earnings  is the amount of income generated by earning assets primarily loans and investment securities less the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities primarily deposits used to fund earning assets 
net interest income and margin are influenced by many factors  primarily the volume and mix of earning assets  funding sources and interest rate fluctuations 
during our net interest margin increased basis points from in to 
the weighted average yield on earning assets decreased basis points while the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points contributing to the increase in net interest margin 
during we lowered rates on all deposit accounts and reduced average borrowings by million 
interest sensitive time deposits were replaced with wholesale funds at lower rates 
the table below  yield on average earning assets and rates on average interest bearing liabilities  summarizes the major components of net interest income for the past three years and also provides yields  rates and average balances 
net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased from million in to million in net interest income depends upon the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the associated yields and rates 
fluctuation in interest rates impacts the volume  mix and yield of average earning assets 
the target federal funds rate  the rate that dictates national prime rate and determines many other short term loan and liability rates  was at december  and declined during as the economy deteriorated and reached an effective rate of at december  average interest earning assets decreased million to million in  down from million in the decline in average earning assets was due in part to a million decrease in average investment securities  primarily as a result of securities being called by the issuers 
average loans outstanding in totaled million compared to million a decrease of million  primarily due to a million decrease in construction loans 
average interest bearing deposits and federal funds in federal funds sold increased million in interest expense totaled million in  a decrease of million from interest bearing deposits averaged million in compared to million in borrowed funds averaged million  down from million in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities was in compared to in the decrease in the cost of funding being greater than the decrease in earning asset yield  combined with a change in the mix and volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is responsible for the improvement in net interest margin 
see the table below entitled volume and rate analysis for changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income increased in to million compared to million in average interest earning assets increased million to million in  up from million in during net interest margin decreased basis points from in to 
the weighted average yield on earning assets increased basis points and the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased basis points interest expense totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million over total interest bearing deposits averaged million in compared to million in borrowed funds averaged million  up from million in the increase in deposits and borrowings funded the growth in earning assets

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense in was million  up from million in this amount was determined by management to restore the allowance for loan losses to a level believed to be adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio based on an evaluation as of december  the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense in was million up from thousand in the increase in the provision for loan losses is primarily due to the million increase in loans held for investment 
non interest income non interest income consists of revenue generated from service fees on deposit accounts  gains on sale of loans and other charges and fees 
the mortgage corporation provides the most significant contributions towards non interest income and is subject to wide fluctuations due to the general interest rate environment and economic conditions 
total non interest income was million in compared to million in gains on the sale of loans originated by the mortgage corporation totaled million in compared to million in gains on sale of loans increased in despite a decrease in loan originations 
the increase is largely due to an increase in the profit margin on loans sold by the mortgage corporation 
mortgage broker fees amounted to million in down from million in due to a decrease in loans originated in this manner 
other income  comprised primarily of miscellaneous loan fees  totaled million in compared to million in total non interest income was million in  compared to million in gains on the sale of loans totaled million in compared to million in mortgage broker fees amounted to million in down from million in  as fewer loans were originated in this manner 
non interest expense non interest expense totaled million in compared to million in compensation and employee benefits  the largest component of non interest expense  totaled million in compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase is primarily due to increased staff and merit salary increases 
other operating expense totaled million for the period ended december  compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in broker premiums as a result of eliminating wholesale operations at the mortgage corporation in management fees increased approximately thousand in and represent fees paid for managing certain offices of the mortgage corporation 
the provision for losses on loans sold by the mortgage corporation increased thousand and represents amounts credited to the allowance for possible losses associated with loans sold 
non interest expense totaled million in up million from million in occupancy expense increased thousand in largely due to the opening of two new banking offices and normal rent increases 
other operating expense increased million due to a thousand increase in broker premiums  a million increase in the provision for losses on loans sold and an thousand increase in other expenses

the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining the corporation s ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of both depositors and borrowers 
asset and liability management functions not only serve to assure adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of the corporation s customers  but also to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities so that the corporation can earn an appropriate return for its shareholders 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments and maturities of investment securities 
other short term investments such as federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with other banks are additional sources of liquidity funding 
at december   overnight interest bearing balances totaled million and securities available for sale net of restricted stock totaled million 
the liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through various interest bearing and non interest bearing deposit accounts  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other short term borrowings 
at december   the corporation had a line of credit with the fhlb totaling million and outstanding variable rate loans of million  and an additional million in term loans at fixed rates ranging from to leaving approximately million available on the line 
in addition to the line of credit at the fhlb  the bank and mortgage corporation issue repurchase agreements and commercial paper 
as of december   outstanding repurchase agreements totaled million and commercial paper issued amounted to million 
the interest rate on these instruments is variable and subject to change daily 
the bank also maintains federal funds lines of credit with its correspondent banks and  at december   these lines amounted to million 
the corporation also has million in subordinated debentures to support the growth of the organization 
the bank relies on deposits and other short and long term resources for liquidity from a variety of sources that substantially reduces reliance upon any single provider 
the corporation expects its short and long term sources of liquidity and capital to remain adequate to support expected growth

these commitments do not necessarily represent cash requirements  since many commitments are expected to expire without being drawn on 
at december  the bank had approximately million in unfunded lines and letters of credit 
at december   loan commitments were million and unfunded lines and letters of credit were million 
the mortgage corporation had open forward contracts at december  totaling million and million at december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the funds management committee is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position and establishes policies to monitor and coordinate the corporation s sources  uses and pricing of funds 
interest rate sensitivity management the corporation uses a simulation model to analyze  manage and formulate operating strategies that address net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates 
the simulation model projects net interest income based on various interest rate scenarios over a twelve month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and re pricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model incorporates certain assumptions which management believes to be reasonable regarding the impact of changing interest rates and the prepayment assumption of certain assets and liabilities as of december  the model assumes changes in interest rates without any management intervention to change the composition of the balance sheet 
according to the model run for the period ended december  over a twelve month period  an immediate basis points increase in interest rates would result in an increase in net interest income by 
an immediate basis points increase in interest rates would result in an increase in net interest income by 
a basis points decrease in interest rates would result in a negative variance in net interest income and is considered remote given current interest rate levels 
while management carefully monitors the exposure to changes in interest rates and takes actions as warranted to decrease any adverse impact  there can be no assurance about the actual effect of interest rate changes on net interest income 
the corporation s net interest income and the fair value of its financial instruments are influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
the corporation manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by its funds management committee 
the funds management committee meets monthly and has responsibility for formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings and reviewing interest rate sensitivity 
the mortgage corporation is party to mortgage rate lock commitments to fund mortgage loans at interest rates previously agreed locked by both the corporation and the borrower for specified periods of time 
when the borrower locks their interest rate  the corporation effectively extends a put option to the borrower  whereby the borrower is not obligated to enter into the loan agreement  but the corporation must honor the interest rate for the specified time period 
the corporation is exposed to interest rate risk during the accumulation of interest rate lock commitments and loans prior to sale 
the corporation utilizes either a best efforts sell forward or a mandatory sell forward commitment to economically hedge the changes in fair value of the loan due to changes in market interest rates 
failure to effectively monitor  manage and hedge the interest rate risk associated with the mandatory commitments subjects the corporation to potentially significant market risk 
throughout the lock period the changes in the market value of interest rate lock commitments  best efforts and mandatory sell forward commitments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses and are included in the statement of operations in mortgage revenue 
the corporation s management has made complex judgments in the recognition of gains and losses in connection with this activity 
the corporation utilizes a third party and its proprietary simulation model to assist in identifying and managing the risk associated with this activity 
impact of inflation and changing prices a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of a non financial company in that virtually all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature 
the impact of inflation on financial results depends upon the bank s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as the prices of other goods and services 
management seeks to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation
