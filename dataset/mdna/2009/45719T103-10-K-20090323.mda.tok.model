inhibitex  mscramm  and aurexis are registered trademarks of inhibitex  inc overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of differentiated anti infective products to prevent and treat serious infections 
we are currently targeting our efforts and resources on the development of small molecule antiviral compounds  and in particular  therapies to treat shingles herpes zoster and chronic hepatitis c infections hcv 
currently available antiviral therapies have various therapeutic limitations  such as inadequate potency  significant adverse side effects  complex dosing schedules  inconvenient methods of administration and diminishing efficacy due to the emergence of drug resistant viruses 
we believe that our drug candidates may have the potential to address a number of these limitations and unmet needs in their respective intended indications 
we believe there are significant business advantages in focusing on the development of new compounds to treat infectious diseases  and in particular viral infections  which include the following infectious disease research and development programs  and in particular with respect to anti viral products  generally have shorter development cycle times when compared to various therapeutic areas such as cardiovascular and central nervous system disorders  historical data suggest that anti infective development programs that enter clinical development generally have a higher clinical success rate  on average  as compared to various other development program areas such as oncology  cardiovascular and central nervous system disorders  the clinical and regulatory pathway for many anti infective indications are well established and understood  
table of contents many antiviral targets have been validated in previous preclinical or clinical trials of other antiviral compounds  thus providing the ability to benchmark or otherwise compare the safety and efficacy of new compounds at relatively early stages of development  and the emergence of drug resistance creates a continuing need for new drugs to treat certain infectious diseases  thus creating new markets and growing business opportunities 
we have neither received regulatory approval to sell or market any of our current or past product candidates  nor do we have any commercialization capabilities  therefore  it is possible that we may never successfully derive any commercial revenues from any of our existing or future product candidates 
we were incorporated in the state of delaware in may background infectious diseases are caused by pathogens present in the environment  such as viruses  bacteria and fungi  which enter the body through the skin or mucous membranes and overwhelm its natural defenses 
some infections are systemic  meaning they can affect the entire body  while others are localized in one organ or system within the body 
the severity of infectious diseases varies depending on the nature of the infectious agent  as well as the degree to which the body s immune system or available therapies can prevent or fight the infection 
the market for anti infective drugs can be divided into three main categories antiviral  antibacterial and antifungal 
the widespread use of anti infective drugs has led to a significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases 
however  for many infectious diseases  current treatment options are associated with suboptimal treatment outcomes  significant drug related adverse or toxic side effects  complex dosing schedules and inconvenient methods of administration  such as injection or infusion 
these factors often lead to patients discontinuing treatment or failing to fully comply with treatment dosing schedules 
as a result  physicians are often required to modify therapy regimens throughout the course of treatment 
moreover  a patient s failure to comply fully with a treatment dosing schedule can both accelerate and exacerbate drug resistance 
the ability of both viruses and bacteria to adapt rapidly to existing or new treatments through genetic mutations allows new strains to develop that are highly resistant to currently available drugs 
in recent years  the increasing prevalence of drug resistant strains has created ongoing treatment challenges with respect to many infectious diseases  including hiv aids and staphylococcus aureus s 
aureus infections 
viruses viruses are microscopic infectious agents consisting of an outer layer of protein surrounding a core of genetic material comprised of dna or rna 
viruses generally invade living host cells in order to grow and replicate 
in many cases  the body s immune system can effectively combat an infection caused by a virus 
however  with certain viral infections  the body s immune system is unable to fully destroy the responsible virus  which results in persistent viral replication and the subsequent infection of healthy cells by the virus 
this ultimately leads to the deterioration or destruction of the infected cells  resulting in disease 
infections caused by viruses can be both acute and chronic 
acute infection is associated with viruses such as influenza or varicella zoster virus vzv  and generally lasts for a relatively short period of time and in most cases will ultimately self resolve 
chronic infection  such as those caused by hcv or hiv  do not typically self resolve and can cause disease for many months or years if left untreated 
viruses can also be characterized as either latent or active 
a latent virus  such as varicella zoster  or vzv  can remain in the body for long periods of time generally and only causes disease when the body s immune system weakens  fails or is suppressed 
an active virus can cause a persistent infection or disease over an extended period of time  such as infections caused by hcv and hiv 
vaccines have been used for many years to prevent an active viral infection from occurring 
antiviral drugs designed to treat or suppress  rather than prevent viral diseases are generally small molecule  chemical entities 
antiviral drugs are increasingly being developed to inhibit or stop the replication of a specific virus  some are active against a family of viruses 

table of contents viruses that develop resistance to antiviral drugs are increasingly a major challenge in the treatment of viral infections 
the ability of viruses to mutate spontaneously during replication allows drug resistant strains to emerge when patients are using drugs that do not quickly and completely inhibit viral replication 
resistance occurs because viruses will continually make millions of copies of themselves every day  some of which will contain mutations in their genetic material 
mutations that confer a replication advantage in the presence of a suppressive antiviral drug will give rise to viral strains that are resistant or partially resistant to that drug 
these mutated viruses  while initially found in low numbers  will eventually become the predominant strain in an infected patient 
once this occurs  the treatment benefit of that antiviral drug often diminishes  resulting in treatment failure and creates a need for an alternate therapy with different or possibly new drugs or classes of drugs 
in general  viruses that cause chronic infections  such as hiv aids  are the viruses are more likely to develop drug resistance due to the long term and persistent exposure of the virus to the antiviral therapy 
bacteria unlike viruses  bacteria do not generally need to invade a living host cell in order to grow and replicate 
bacteria are unicellular  self propagating microorganisms that multiply through growth in bacterial cell size and the subsequent division of the cell 
bacteria can be broadly classified into two categories based upon the composition of their cell walls gram positive or gram negative 
many antibacterial drugs that are effective against gram positive bacteria are less effective or totally ineffective against gram negative bacteria  and vice versa 
antibacterial drugs that are active against a large number of both classes of bacteria are often referred to as broad spectrum antibacterials 
antibiotics  which are small molecule compounds  comprise the vast majority of currently marketed antibacterial drugs 
antibiotics have historically proved to be highly successful in controlling the morbidity and mortality that accompany many bacterial infections 
however  due to the widespread use of antibiotics over time and the ability of bacteria to quickly develop drug resistance  many of these antibiotics now have diminished or limited antibacterial activity 
the inability to effectively treat serious infections caused by drug resistant bacteria has led to increased mortality rates  prolonged hospitalizations and increased health care costs  and has become a public health issue of significant concern 
accordingly  in recent years  a number of novel approaches to prevent and treat bacterial infections  including new classes of antibiotics  vaccines and the use of antibodies  have emerged in development

table of contents fv for shingles fv is an orally available nucleoside analogue prodrug we are developing for the treatment of herpes zoster  or shingles  which is caused by the reactivation of vzv 
published preclinical studies demonstrate that fv is significantly more potent against vzv than acyclovir  valacyclovir  and famciclovir  the only fda approved drugs for the treatment of shingles 
preclinical studies further demonstrate that fv has a much more rapid onset of antiviral activity and can fully inhibit the replication of vzv more rapidly than these drugs at significantly lower concentration levels 
we believe these characteristics provide the potential for fv  and its antivirally active derivative cf  to reduce the incidence  severity  and duration of shingles related symptoms  including lesions  acute pain and post herpetic neuralgia phn 
in addition  pharmacokinetic data from recently completed phase i clinical trials suggest fv has the potential to be dosed orally once a day at significantly lower levels than valacyclovir  acyclovir  and famciclovir 
we recently completed our phase i clinical trials of fv  including a multiple ascending dose study in subjects aged to and a separate trial conducted in subjects years of age or older 
we reported that there were no serious adverse events in either trial and that fv appeared to be well tolerated at all dose levels 
there were no differences noted in the safety results for subjects aged to and those aged and older 
further  pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that all doses maintained mean plasma levels of the active form of fv that exceeded the ec for approximately hours  supporting the potential for once a day dosing in future trials 
subject to fda review  we plan to initiate a phase ii clinical trial of fv in shingles patients in the second quarter of we plan to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses of fv compared to valacyclovir 
objectives of the phase ii trial will include  among others  the reduction in the severity and duration of shingles related pain  the prevalence of phn  and time to lesion healing 
market opportunity for the treatment of shingles vzv  a dna virus and a member of the herpes virus group  is the virus that causes both chickenpox and herpes zoster  or shingles 
initial infections with vzv  or chicken pox  generally occur during childhood 
after the chickenpox infection subsides  vzv remains latent in the individual s dorsal root and cranial nerve ganglia 
individuals who have had chickenpox are at risk for reactivation of the vzv virus  known as herpes zoster  or shingles 
although shingles can occur in any individual with a prior vzv infection  its incidence varies with age and immune status  which are the key risk factors 
in  there were an estimated million cases of shingles in the us in europe and japan  the estimated number of shingles cases is and million  respectively 
shingles is largely a disease of the aged or aging  with over of all cases occurring in individuals over the age of  and approximately of the cases occurring in individuals over the age of due to the aging of the population in many industrialized countries  as well as the increasing use of immunosuppressive agents in transplant patients and the increased numbers of immunosuppressed patients from cancer therapy  the incidence of shingles is expected to increase 
it is estimated that approximately of all persons in the us will suffer from shingles during their lifetime 
the symptoms associated with shingles generally include localized lesions  rash and pain 
shingles generally starts as small lesions  with new lesions continuing to form for a week or more 
however  in certain cases the patient may notice localized prodomal pain prior to the appearance of lesions 
the lesions generally follow the path of nerves that emanate from the spinal cord around the torso  however the infection is also commonly found on the face and neck 
eventually  the lesions will pustulate and the infected areas will typically crust over and heal 
the dermatological symptoms associated with a shingles infection typically will resolve in two to four weeks 
in rare instances  lesions may never appear  but pain will be present 
fewer than of patients experience significant systemic symptoms from shingles  such as fever  headache  malaise  or fatigue 
the pain associated with an episode of shingles is a result of damage to the nerve fibers caused by the replication of vzv and the subsequent inflammation associated with the infection 
pain symptoms are commonly described as a burning sensation  with bouts of stabbing and shooting pain  often set off by 
table of contents touching the affected area 
the majority of shingles patients experience acute pain in connection with their infection 
in some patients  shingles related pain does not resolve when the rash and lesions heal but  rather  continues for months  or possibly years 
persistent shingles related pain that lasts more than several months is referred to as phn and it is the most common complication of shingles 
approximately of all shingles patients experience phn  although the incidence of phn increases in patients over years of age 
previous studies have established that additional risk factors for phn include greater acute pain intensity  severity of the dermatological symptoms  and the presence and greater severity of a painful prodrome preceding the rash 
in  merck co 
inc  received approval to market a vaccine to prevent the incidence of shingles for individuals years of age and older 
clinical data indicated that the vaccine reduced the incidence of shingles by approximately in this population  although the vaccine s effectiveness decreased over time 
valacyclovir  acyclovir and famciclovir are oral antivirals currently indicated and approved by the fda and in many other countries to treat shingles 
these drugs are referred to as pan herpetic drugs  as they are currently being used to treat infections caused by various viruses in the herpes virus group  including herpes simplex and  and herpes zoster 
unlike these drugs  fv only demonstrates antiviral activity against vzv  and not other viruses in the herpes family 
the majority of the over billion in annual sales these drugs generate in the united states is for non shingles use 
however  based upon ims health  inc ims data  we currently estimate that the size of the market for oral antivirals to treat shingles exceeds million per year in the united states 
however  we believe that the market opportunity for a differentiated antiviral drug that can address the unmet medical needs of shingles patients  as outlined below  could be substantially larger 
limitations of current therapies clinical trial data demonstrate that a seven to ten day administration of valacyclovir  acyclovir  and famciclovir  beginning less than hours after the appearance of a shingles related rash or lesion  can lessen the duration of the dermatological symptoms associated with shingles 
however  these currently approved pan herpetic antiviral drugs  when used to treat shingles  have a number of limitations  including the following no approved label for the reduction of acute pain and phn 
currently  there are no oral antiviral therapies indicated for the reduction or prevention of shingles related acute pain and phn 
there is also no cure for phn  rather  treatment of phn is accomplished through pain management 
the most commonly prescribed medications are opioids  antidepressants  anticonvulsants and a topical lidocaine patch 
based upon previously published data  antiviral therapy can reduce acute pain and phn  and we believe a highly potent  fast acting anti vzv compound  such as fv  may have the potential to more rapidly inhibit the replication of vzv  thus reducing the incidence of shingles related nerve damage and therefore  acute pain and phn 
we believe an antiviral therapy that can reduce acute pain and phn may have a significant competitive advantage relative to the currently available oral antiviral shingles therapies 
inconvenient dosing 
due to their suboptimal pharmacokinetic properties and potency against vzv  current pan herpetic oral antiviral therapies require shingles patients to take three to five oral doses each day for seven to ten days 
specifically  current dosing regimens are as follows valacyclovir  mg  three times per day  famciclovir mg  three times per day  and acyclovir mg  five times per day 
given the fact that many shingles patients are elderly and are taking other medications  such dosing regimens are inconvenient and can result in non compliance and hence  less than optimal treatment outcomes 
we believe that a convenient  once a day oral administration of an effective antiviral therapy may have a competitive advantage relative to current shingles therapies 
doses of current antiviral drugs must be adjusted for patients with insufficient renal function 
although current pan herpetic oral antiviral therapies are generally safe and well tolerated in shingles patients  dosing of valacyclovir  famciclovir and acyclovir must be adjusted for certain patients with insufficient renal kidney function to avoid potential adverse events 
clinical data from our phase i trials of fv in healthy volunteers indicated that fv was generally well tolerated and does not appear to be primarily excreted through the kidneys 
while its safety profile will be further studied  fv may not need to be adjusted for patients with insufficient renal function 
we believe that an oral antiviral therapy that has a 
table of contents similar safety profile to valacyclovir  famciclovir and acyclovir  but is not required to be adjusted for patients with insufficient renal function  may have a competitive advantage over currently approved shingles therapies 
we believe there is a significant unmet need for a more potent and faster acting  once a day oral antiviral agent such as fv that has the potential to reduce the incidence  severity  and duration of shingles related symptoms  including rash  lesions  acute pain and phn 
due to its demonstrated potency and ability to rapidly penetrate cells  we also believe that the amount of fv necessary to fully inhibit viral replication of vzv may be significantly lower than that of the current antiviral therapies  resulting in smaller doses and potentially fewer side effects 
we also believe that the pharmacokinetic properties of fv  as observed to date in preclinical studies and in our recently completed phase i trial  may provide for less frequent oral dosing than valacyclovir  acyclovir and famciclovir 
fv clinical trials phase i 
in february  we completed a blinded  placebo controlled multiple ascending dose trial designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of five oral doses of fv   and mg administered once daily and mg administered twice daily  each for seven days in healthy subjects aged to each dose cohort consisted of six subjects that received fv and two that received placebo 
the results of the trial demonstrated that there were no serious adverse events and fv appeared to be generally well tolerated at all dose levels evaluated 
further  pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that all doses maintained mean plasma levels of cf  the active form of fv  which exceeded its ec for at least hours  supporting the evaluation of once a day dosing of fv in future clinical trials 
the ec represents the concentration of drug that is required for inhibition of viral replication in vitro 
we also completed a blinded  placebo controlled phase i trial to evaluate single and multiple doses of fv in healthy subjects years of age and older 
one dose cohort consisted of twelve healthy subjects  ten of whom received a single administration of mg of fv and two of whom received placebo  and the second cohort also consisted of twelve healthy subjects  ten of whom received mg of fv administered once daily for seven consecutive days and two of whom received placebo 
the results of this trial demonstrated no significant differences between these subjects and those from the multiple ascending dose trial 
in august  we completed a phase i single ascending dose clinical trial of fv the blinded  placebo controlled trial evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of four doses of fv in six cohorts of healthy volunteers    and mg  as well as a two mg food effect groups 
each cohort consisted of six subjects that received fv and two that received placebo 
there were no serious adverse events observed and the compound appeared to be generally well tolerated in the trial 
in addition  pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that all doses evaluated in the trial maintained plasma levels of cf  the active form of fv  which exceeded its ec for at least hours 
in december  we completed a blinded  placebo controlled single ascending dose phase i clinical trial of fv  which was conducted under an exploratory investigational new drug application ind 
the trial was designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of three oral doses of fv  and mg in healthy volunteers to years of age 
each of the three dose cohorts consisted of six subjects that received fv and two that received placebo 
the results of the trial demonstrated that there were no serious adverse events observed and that the compound appeared to be generally well tolerated 
in addition  pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that all three doses achieved plasma levels of cf  the active form of fv  which exceeded the ec  with the mg dose maintaining such levels for approximately eight hours 
hcv nucleoside polymerase inhibitors our hcv program currently consists of a series of nucleoside polymerase inhibitors we are developing for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c  which is caused by the hcv virus 
more specifically  we are developing a series of phosphoramidate nucleoside analogues  also referred to as pronucleotides or protides  which are prodrugs of nucleosides that target the rna dependent rna polymerase nsb of hcv 
we believe that 
table of contents our protide approach possesses several pharmacological advantages over earlier  first generation approaches that use the parent nucleoside alone 
these include a significant increase in antiviral activity  higher concentrations of the anti virally active triphosphate in liver and potentially less toxicity due to reduced systemic exposure 
we have initiated advanced preclinical studies with a lead candidate 
our decision to proceed into advanced preclinical studies was based on favorable results from in vitro and in vivo studies we have completed to date  in which these compounds demonstrated excellent potency in various hcv replicon assays  rapid conversion to the triphosphate in primary human hepatocytes  favorable pharmacokinetic properties in orally dosed primates and rodents  and a favorable profile 
in vitro studies using a hcv genotype a and b subgenomic replicon system demonstrate that our protides are among the most potent hcv nucleoside polymerase inhibitors currently in development 
market opportunity for the treatment of hcv hcv is a leading cause of chronic liver disease  including cirrhosis  organ failure and cancer  and the leading cause of death from liver disease in the united states 
hcv is often found among hemodialysis patients  hemophiliacs and recipients of blood transfusions before hcv is now transmitted primarily through injection drug use and by pregnant women infecting their children in utero 
the world health organization estimates that nearly million people worldwide  or approximately of the world s population  are infected with hcv 
of these individuals  million are chronic hcv carriers with an increased risk of developing liver cirrhosis or liver cancer 
hcv is responsible for more than half of all liver cancer cases and two thirds of all liver transplants in the developed world 
it is estimated that to million people worldwide are newly infected each year  the majority of whom will develop chronic hepatitis c 
the center for disease control cdc estimates that approximately million people in the united states are chronically infected with hcv 
because symptoms of this chronic disease do not typically appear until its later stages  carriers often do not realize they are infected  and therefore serve as a source of transmission 
limitations of current therapies the current standard of care for the treatment of hcv infection is a combination of a once weekly injection of pegylated interferon and a twice daily oral administration of ribavirin for weeks 
pegylated interferon is a modified version of alpha interferon  a protein that occurs naturally in the human body and stimulates the ability of the immune system to fight viral infections 
ribavirin is an antiviral drug that does not specifically target hcv rna  but interferes with the replication of viruses 
unlike hiv  hcv is curable in the sense that current standard of care can result in a sustained viral response  svr defined as the absence of a detectable amount of the virus in the blood six months after the completion of treatment 
there are several subtypes  or genotypes  of hcv 
in the united states  hcv genotypes a and b are the two predominant strains of hcv and account for approximately of hcv infections 
unfortunately  less than of patients with hcv genotypes a and b achieve a svr when treated with current standard of care 
despite these limitations and a suboptimal side effect profile  current hcv therapies generated worldwide sales of approximately billion in  and sales of these products are forecast to increase to more than billion by and billion by accordingly  there are a number of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies pursuing the development of various classes of antiviral compounds that directly inhibit the replication of hcv by targeting various proteins and enzymes of the virus 
direct antiviral therapy is now emerging as a potential complement or alternative to the current standard of care 
there are several classes of direct antiviral compounds currently being developed  including protease inhibitors  which are the most clinically advanced class  nucleoside and non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors and other emerging antivirals that inhibit other hcv molecular targets 
in order to optimize the potential of direct antiviral therapy  it is believed that these various classes will ultimately be used in combination  akin to what has evolved in the treatment of hiv aids 
further  similar to current hiv aids therapy  where nucleosides have become a cornerstone of combination therapy  we believe nsb nucleoside polymerase inhibitors will play a similar role in the treatment of chronic hepatitis c infections 

table of contents there are currently two approaches to inhibiting the activity of the hcv polymerase 
the one we are utilizing is the use of nucleoside analogues that mimic the nucleotides normally recognized by the enzyme as it builds a new copy of the viral genome 
these nucleoside analogues take advantage of the fact that the virus can tolerate few mutations in its active sites 
any amino acid changes that might occur and that would reduce the ability of the nucleoside analogue to bind may also reduce the ability of the polymerase to bind the normal nucleotides 
the other approach involves non nucleoside inhibitors that can bind to various regions on the polymerase away from the active site 
this type of binding generally prevents the polymerase from assuming the correct configuration and in turn either reduces or prevents its ability to replicate 
the activity of non nucleoside compounds depends on their ability to bind relatively tightly to specific amino acid sequences and often involves multiple molecular interactions 
if any of these interactions are missing due to a change in the polymerase sequence  then binding can not occur properly 
the probability of this happening tends to be higher with non nucleoside than with nucleoside analogues 
the fda has not yet approved any nsb polymerase inhibitors for the treatment of hcv infection  but several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are developing product candidates that target the hcv polymerase 
the most advanced nucleoside polymerase inhibitors are currently in phase ii clinical trials 
hiv integrase inhibitors integrase inhibitors are an emerging class of antiretroviral agents being developed for the treatment of hiv aids 
this class of compounds blocks or inhibits the insertion of hiv dna into the genome of the host cell  thereby stopping the virus from replicating 
by inhibiting a different molecular target than other classes of hiv drugs  such as reverse transcriptase or protease inhibitors  integrase inhibitors have the potential to treat patients with drug resistant strains of hiv 
preclinical studies of our integrase inhibitors have demonstrated that the compounds are potent and orally available  exhibit multiple mechanisms of integrase inhibition in vitro and have the potential to be active against hiv strains that are resistant to other antiretroviral classes  as the only integrase inhibitor approved for sale 
in august  we announced that we had assigned our hcv nucleoside polymerase inhibitor program a higher priority than our hiv program and have realigned our internal resources in order to maximize the potential of accelerating our hcv program 
due to the challenging economic environment and our strategic focus on conserving our capital resources for the development of fv and our hcv polymerase program  at this time we are not allocating any internal resources to our hiv program and have indefinitely suspended our plan to complete such activities 
aurexis aurexis is a humanized monoclonal antibody being developed as a first line therapy  in combination with antibiotics  for the treatment of serious  life threatening s 
aureus bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients 
aurexis targets clumping factor a  clfa a protein found on the surface of virtually all strains of s 
aureus  including methicillin resistant s 
aureus  mrsa 
therefore  we believe aurexis may have the potential to be effective in treating infections caused by methicillin sensitive s 
aureus or mrsa 
we have completed an exploratory patient phase ii trial of aurexis in patients with confirmed s 
aureus bloodstream infections 
the results suggested that aurexis was generally safe and well tolerated in these patients 
aurexis has been granted fast track designation by the fda for the adjunctive treatment of s 
aureus bloodstream infections 
due to our strategic focus on antivirals  and more specifically advancing the development of fv and our hcv polymerase program  we do not intend to allocate any additional resources to advance the clinical development of aurexis at this time 
we continue to seek licensing  co development collaborations  or other business arrangements that can provide financial resources and other synergistic capabilities to support its further development 

table of contents market opportunity for the treatment of s 
aureus infections s 
aureus is one of the leading causes of hospital associated infections worldwide 
an estimated  s 
aureus infections occur in the united states annually 
we estimate  based on compiled data  that approximately  of these s 
aureus infections are bloodstream infections  also referred to as s 
aureus bacteremia 
we believe that the degree to which the medical community may adopt the use of aurexis  if and when it is approved by the fda  will be based primarily on its ability to incrementally reduce the incidence of infection associated mortality  the relapse rate associated with these infections  unresolved secondary site infections  and the number of days that patients with such infections stay in the intensive care unit or hospital  over antibiotics alone 
aurexis clinical trials phase ii 
in may  we reported the results from a patient phase ii clinical trial of aurexis  in combination with antibiotics  for the treatment of documented s 
aureus bacteremia in hospitalized patients 
patients were randomized to receive antibiotic therapy in combination with either aurexis  at mg kg  or placebo 
both aurexis and the placebo were administered intravenously as a single dose 
in this trial  standard of care antibiotic therapy was selected by the individual investigators 
subjects were followed for days or until early termination from the trial 
the primary objectives of the phase ii trial were to evaluate the safety  pharmacokinetics  and biological activity of a single does of aurexis 
in the trial  aurexis appeared to be generally well tolerated 
further  favorable trends were observed in the composite primary endpoint of mortality  relapse rate and infection related complications  and a number of secondary endpoints and ad hoc analyses  including the progression in the severity of sepsis  the number of days in the intensive care unit  and the resolution of complications associated with s 
aureus bacteremia 
the phase ii trial was not powered or designed to demonstrate statistically significant differences among the treatment arms in measures of efficacy 
accordingly  these preliminary findings were not statistically significant 
we cannot guarantee that the results of subsequent clinical trials of aurexis will confirm the findings of the phase ii trial 
staphylococcal vaccine worldwide  over million people undergo non emergency surgical operations each year  representing a large target population at risk for acquiring a s 
aureus infection 
this population represents a significant opportunity for a vaccine to prevent such infections  particularly in those countries with a high incidence of mrsa 
there are also a number of patient groups  including approximately  end stage renal disease patients in the united states  patients receiving chronic long term care  and the elderly  who are at high risk of acquiring a s 
aureus infection 
further  target groups for s 
aureus infection prevention strategies include patients with an impaired immune system  hiv or cancer chemotherapy patients  as well as premature and critically ill infants and acute surgery patients 
for these high risk groups  we believe an active vaccine that can enhance immunity against staphylococcal organisms may be a lower cost and preferred mode of therapy 
we have entered into a license and collaboration agreement with wyeth pharmaceuticals  wyeth for the development of vaccines against staphylococcal organisms 
wyeth has initiated preclinical studies of a vaccine candidate 
diagnostic products in january  we entered into a license and commercialization agreement with m company  m for the development of certain diagnostic products using intellectual property from our mscramm protein technology 
in exchange for this license  we received an upfront license payment and the right to receive future milestone payments  financial support of certain research and development activities  and royalty payments on product sales 
m has discontinued its efforts to commercialize certain antibody based diagnostics and terminated its license and commercialization agreement with us effective march as a result  all mscramm related intellectual property sublicensed to m for the development of infectious disease 
table of contents diagnostics will revert back to us 
the conclusion of this agreement will not have a material effect on our financial position or operations 
our strategy our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company that discovers and develops differentiated product that prevent and treat serious infections 
in order to achieve this strategic goal  we intend to employ the following strategies focus our resources on the development of our antiviral product candidates that can achieve clinical proof of concept in the next months 
over the next one to two years  we plan to focus our resources on further developing our most advanced clinical antiviral compound  fv  and our hcv nucleoside polymerase inhibitors 
more specifically  we plan to complete a phase ii proof of concept clinical trial of fv in shingles patients  and complete ind enabling studies for a lead candidate from our hcv nucleoside polymerase program  file an ind for a lead candidate in the first half of we currently do not plan to allocate any additional resources to advance the preclinical or clinical development of our hiv compounds and our mscramm protein platform  including aurexis 
we do intend to pursue licensing  co development  collaborations or other business arrangements that can provide financial and other synergistic capabilities to support the further development and potential of aurexis 
further  we also plan to continue to support our existing mscramm based license and collaboration agreement with wyeth for the development of staphylococcal vaccines 
accelerate growth through collaborations 
we intend to establish strategic collaborations  partnerships and alliances that we believe can accelerate the development and commercialization of our antiviral product candidates beyond clinical proof of concept by utilizing the financial  clinical development  manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of a leading pharmaceutical company 
research and development our research and development expense in and was million and million  respectively 
we plan to focus our resources on our most advanced clinical antiviral compound  fv  and our hcv nucleoside polymerase inhibitors 
sales and marketing we currently have no commercialization capabilities 
at this time  we anticipate partnering or collaborating with other larger pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical companies to support the development of our antiviral product candidates beyond clinical proof of concept  through late stage clinical development  and if successful  commercialization 
however  other than our agreements with wyeth  we may decide not to license any development and commercialization rights to our product candidates in the future 
manufacturing we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities 
we currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce materials required to conduct certain preclinical studies and clinical trials under current good manufacturing practices  cgmp with oversight by our management team 
we currently rely on a single manufacturer for the preclinical and clinical trial materials of each of our product candidates 
however  we believe there are alternate sources of supply and other contract manufacturers that can produce materials for our preclinical studies and clinical trial requirements without significant delay or material additional costs 
we have used a contract manufacturer  davos chemical company  inc  davos to produce clinical trial material for use in the clinical trials of fv as of december   we have no long term  non cancellable obligations under any of our prior agreements with davos to manufacture additional clinical trial material for our fv program 

table of contents competition our industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change 
key competitive factors in our industry include  among others  the ability to successfully advance the development of a product candidate through preclinical and clinical trials  the efficacy  toxicological  safety  resistance or cross resistance  and dosing profile of a product or product candidate  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals  if ever achieved  government reimbursement rates for and the average selling price of competing products and pharmaceutical products in general  the availability of raw materials and qualified manufacturing capacity  manufacturing costs  intellectual property and patent rights and their protection  and sales and marketing capabilities 
if ultimately approved  fv  or any product candidate from our current or future development programs  would compete against existing therapies or other product candidates in various stages of clinical development that we believe may become available for the treatment of shingles  hepatitis c  hiv and bacterial infections in the future 
some of the large pharmaceutical companies that currently market products that would compete with our product candidates include  but are not limited to glaxosmithkline  novartis and merck in the shingles market  roche and schering plough in the hepatitis c market  and pfizer  glaxosmithkline  bristol meyers squibb  johnson johnson  abbott  merck and gilead in the hiv market 
in addition  there are several other companies developing product candidates  particularly in the hcv market  that may compete with our product candidates in the future 
developing pharmaceutical product candidates is a highly competitive  expensive and risky activity with a long business cycle 
many organizations  including large pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  have substantially more capital resources than we have  and much greater capabilities and experience than we have in basic research and discovery  designing and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  operating in a highly regulated environment  manufacturing drug substances and drug products  marketing and sales 
our competitors may be more successful than we are in obtaining fda or other regulatory approvals for their product candidates and achieving broad market acceptance once they are approved 
our competitors drugs or product candidates may be more effective  have fewer negative side effects  be more convenient to administer  have a more favorable drug resistance profile  or be more effectively marketed and sold than any drug we  or our potential collaborators  may commercialize 
new drugs  or new classes of drugs from our competitors may render our product candidates obsolete or non competitive before we are able to successfully develop them or  if approved  before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates 
we anticipate that we or our collaborators will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs and drug classes enter the market and advanced technologies or new drug targets become available 
if our product candidates do not demonstrate any competitive advantages over existing drugs  new drugs or product candidates  we or our future collaborators may terminate the development or commercialization of our product candidates at any time in the future 
a number of our product candidates  particularly fv  will compete directly or indirectly with existing generic drugs  or drugs that will be generic by the time our product candidates might be approved for sale 
generic drugs are drugs whose patent protection has expired  and generally have an average selling price substantially lower than drugs protected by intellectually property rights 
unless a patented drug can differentiate itself from a generic drug in a meaningful manner  the existence of generic competition in any indication will generally impose significant pricing pressure on competing drugs 
intellectual property rights and patents patent and other proprietary rights are crucial in our business and to support the development of our product candidates 
we have sought  and intend to continue to seek  patent protection for our inventions and rely upon patents  trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain a competitive advantage 
in order to protect these rights  know how and trade secrets  we typically require employees  consultants  collaborators and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements with us  generally stating that they will not disclose any confidential information about us to third parties for a certain period of time  and will otherwise not use confidential information for anyone s benefit but ours 

table of contents the patent positions of companies in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industry involve complex legal and factual questions and therefore  their enforceability cannot be predicted with any certainty 
our issued patents  those licensed to us  and those that may be issued to us in the future may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and the rights granted thereunder may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us 
because of the extensive time required for development  testing and regulatory review of a potential drug product candidate  it is possible that our patent rights in any of our product candidates may expire before such products can be approved for sale and commercialized  or that our relevant patent rights remain in force for only a short period following commercialization 
expiration of patents or rights we own or license could adversely affect our ability to protect future product development and  consequently  our operating results and financial position 
our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property rights for the technology  inventions and improvements we consider important to our product candidates  defend our patents and proprietary rights  preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets  and operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties 
we have a licensed to an issued patent and pending patent applications with respect to fv in the united states and internationally 
the earliest projected expiration date for patents which may issue from those patent applications is approximately  while many of the pending patents will not expire until at least we have a license to multiple pending patent applications  including a corresponding pct application  relating to our hcv nucleoside polymerase inhibitors 
the earliest projected expiration date for any patents that may issue is approximately we have a license to an issued patent relating to our hiv integrase inhibitors  and the earliest projected expiration date for this patent is a related us application is also pending  as are national phase international applications 
we also have several pending patent applications in the united states and internationally 
we currently own or are licensed under numerous patents and patent applications in the unites states and foreign countries related to our mscramm protein technology 
we have four issued us patents relating to the clfa protein found on s 
aureus and antibodies to the protein 
these patents will expire in    and respectively  if not extended 
there are no corresponding foreign rights available for the clfa protein and nucleic acid sequences 
two issued us patents and their international counterparts relate to aurexis and contain claims to monoclonal antibodies recognizing the clfa protein 
the us patents will expire in if not extended 
licensing and collaborations our strategy is to pursue collaborations  partnerships or license agreements in the future with companies that may utilize our intellectual property in their products  or develop  co develop  market and sell our product candidates 
we have entered into two such agreements to date 
wyeth in august  we entered into a license and development collaboration agreement with wyeth for the development of human staphylococcal vaccines 
under the terms of this agreement  we granted wyeth an exclusive worldwide license to our mscramm protein intellectual property with respect to human vaccines against staphylococcal organisms 
the development  manufacture and sale of any products resulting from the collaboration will be the responsibility of wyeth 
we may terminate this agreement if wyeth fails to use 
table of contents reasonable commercial efforts to bring related products to market 
wyeth may terminate the agreement without cause upon six months notice 
otherwise  this agreement will terminate upon the expiration of all of the licensed patents in pursuant to this agreement  we have received million in an upfront license fee and annual research support payments from wyeth as of december  we are entitled to receive minimum research support payments of million per year until commercial sales reach a targeted threshold of any product developed under this agreement 
we are also entitled to receive milestone payments upon the filing of an investigational new drug application  ind the commencement of both a phase ii and phase iii clinical trials  the filing of a biologics license application  bla and fda approval of a licensed product 
if all such milestones are achieved relative to one licensed product  we would be entitled to receive a minimum of million in milestone payments from wyeth 
the maximum amount of milestone payments we could receive with respect to all licensed products is million 
finally  we are also entitled to royalties on net sales of licensed products manufactured  sold or distributed by wyeth 
m in january  we entered into a license and commercialization agreement with m for the development of certain diagnostic products using our mscramm protein platform 
under the terms of the agreement  we granted m an exclusive global license to use clfa  an mscramm surface protein  in the development of diagnostic products 
we also granted m a license to use additional mscramm protein targets for the development of other diagnostic products 
in exchange for these licenses  we received an upfront license payment and the right to receive future milestone payments  financial support of further research and development activities and royalty payments on product sales 
m has notified us that it has discontinued its efforts to commercialize antibody based diagnostics and will terminate its license and commercialization agreement with us effective march as a result  all mscramm related intellectual property sublicensed to m for the development of infectious disease diagnostics will revert to us 
other licensing agreements in september  we completed the acquisition of fermavir pharmaceuticals  inc fermavir 
as part of the acquisition  we acquired the rights to an exclusive worldwide royalty bearing license from cardiff university in wales  united kingdom  which includes fv  a nucleoside analogue for the treatment of vzv infections  and a series of preclinical nucleoside analogues with antiviral activity against cytomegalovirus  or cmv 
the license agreement calls for us to make certain contingent milestone payments and pay a royalty on the sale of any products that utilize the underlying technology 
we may terminate this agreement upon days notice 
in september  we obtained an exclusive worldwide royalty bearing license from the university of georgia research foundation  ugarf for intellectual property covering a series of hiv integrase inhibitors and other antiviral compounds in exchange for an upfront license fee of million and shares of our common stock with the fair market value of million  plus future milestone payments and royalties on future net sales 
we may terminate this agreement upon days notice 
otherwise  this agreement terminates upon the expiration of any issued patents 
pursuant to this license agreement  we also entered into a cooperative research agreement with ugarf under which we pay annual sponsored research payments 
in august  we renewed the cooperative research agreement  at a rate of million in annual sponsored research payments  and relinquished non hiv related intellectual property rights 
in november  we entered into an exclusive royalty bearing worldwide license agreement with cardiff university in wales  united kingdom and katholieke universiteit in leuven  belgium for intellectual property covering a series of hcv nucleoside polymerase inhibitors in exchange for an upfront license fee  future milestone payments and royalties on future net sales 
the agreement calls for us to make certain milestone payments and pay a royalty on the sale of any products that utilize the underlying technology 
we may terminate this agreement upon days notice 
pursuant to this license agreement  we entered into cooperative research agreements with cardiff university and katholieke universiteit under which we collectively pay cardiff university and katholieke universiteit approximately million in annual sponsored research payments 

table of contents pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement in the united states and most foreign markets  any revenue associated with the sale of our products  if approved  will depend largely upon the availability of reimbursement from third party payers 
third party payers include various government health authorities such as the centers for medicare and medicaid services  cms which administers medicare and medicaid in the united states  managed care providers  private health insurers and other organizations 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services  including pharmaceuticals 
in addition  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products 
our products may ultimately not be considered cost effective  and adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to support a profitable operation or generate an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
the united states and foreign governments periodically propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare 
accordingly  legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before any of our product candidates are ever approved for marketing 
adoption of new legislation could further limit reimbursement for pharmaceuticals 
in addition  an increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states has and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing 
the marketability of our products may suffer if the government and other third party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement rates for our product candidates 
we  or our existing or future collaborators  intend to obtain coverage and reimbursement from these third party payers for any of our products that may be approved for sale  however  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining adequate coverage  reimbursement  or pricing  if any 
regulatory matters overview the preclinical and clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  storage  distribution  promotion  sale and export  reporting and record keeping of drug product candidates is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states  principally the united states food and drug administration  fda and corresponding state agencies  and regulatory agencies in foreign countries 
non compliance with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  total or partial suspension of the clinical development of a product candidate  manufacturing and marketing  failure of the government to grant marketing approval  withdrawal of marketing approvals  fines  injunctions  seizure of products and criminal prosecution 
united states regulatory approval pursuant to fda regulations  we are required to undertake a long and rigorous development process before any of our product candidates can be marketed or sold in the united states 
this regulatory process typically includes the following steps the completion of satisfactory preclinical studies under the fda s good laboratory practices glp regulation  the submission and acceptance of an ind that must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  obtaining the approval of institutional review boards  irb  at each site where we plan to conduct a clinical trial to protect the welfare and rights of human subjects in clinical trials  the successful completion of a series of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety  purity  potency and efficacy of any product candidate for its intended use  which conform to the fda s good clinical practice gcp regulations  
table of contents the development and demonstration of manufacturing processes that conform to fda mandated current good manufacturing practices  cgmps  and the submission to  and review and approval by  the fda of a new drug application  nda or for biologic pharmaceutical products  a biologics license application  bla prior to any commercial sale or shipment of a product 
successfully completing this development process requires a substantial amount of time and financial resources 
we cannot assure you or be certain that this process will result in the granting of an approval for any of our product candidates on a timely basis  if at all 
preclinical studies preclinical studies generally include laboratory  or in vitro evaluation of a product candidate  its chemistry  formulation  stability and toxicity  as well as certain animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy 
we must submit the results of these preclinical studies  together with manufacturing information  analytical data and the clinical trial protocol  to the fda as part of an ind  which must become effective before we may begin any human clinical trials 
an ind generally becomes effective days after receipt by the fda  unless the fda  within this day time period  raises concerns or questions about the intended conduct of the trials and imposes what is referred to as a clinical hold 
if one or more of our product candidates is placed on clinical hold  we would be required to resolve any outstanding issues to the satisfaction of the fda before we could begin  or continue  clinical trials 
preclinical studies supportive of an ind generally take a year or more to complete  and there is no guarantee that an ind based on those studies will become effective  allowing human clinical testing to begin 
certain preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the fda s good laboratory practice  or glp regulations and the united states department of agriculture s animal welfare act 
violations of these regulations can  in some cases  lead to invalidation of the studies  requiring such studies to be conducted again 
clinical trials this clinical phase of development follows a successful ind submission and involves the activities necessary to demonstrate safety  tolerability  efficacy and dosage of the substance in humans  as well as the ability to produce the finished drug product in accordance with the fda s cgmp  requirements 
clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing  among other things  the objectives of the study and the parameters to be used in assessing the safety and the efficacy of the product candidate 
each clinical trial protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind prior to beginning the trial 
each trial must be reviewed  approved and conducted under the auspices of an irb and each trial  with limited exceptions  must include the patient s informed consent 
sponsors  investigators  and irbs also must satisfy extensive gcp  including regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects  complying with the protocol and investigational plan  adequately monitoring the clinical trial  and reporting adverse events on a timely basis 
the fda  the irb or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
foreign studies performed under an ind must meet the same requirements that apply to studies conducted in the united states 
the fda may accept a foreign clinical study not conducted under an ind only if the study is well designed  well conducted  performed by qualified investigators  and conforms to the ethical principles contained in the declaration of helsinki  or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research was conducted  whichever provides greater protection of the human subjects 
clinical trials to support an nda or bla for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases  phases i  ii and iii  with phase iv clinical trials conducted after marketing approval has been granted 
fda may require sponsors to conduct phase iv clinical trials to study certain safety issues 
data from these activities are compiled in an nda or a bla for submission to the fda requesting approval to market the drug 
these phases may be compressed  may overlap  or may be omitted in some circumstances 

table of contents phase i after an ind becomes effective  phase i human clinical trials can begin 
a product candidate is typically introduced either into healthy human subjects or in some cases  patients with the medical condition for which the product candidate is intended to be used 
generally  the main purpose of a phase i trial is to assess a product candidate s safety and the ability of the human body to tolerate it 
absorption  metabolism  distribution and pharmacokinetic trials are also generally performed at this stage 
phase i trials typically evaluate these aspects of the investigational drug in both single doses as well as multiple doses 
phase ii during phase ii trials  a product candidate is generally studied in an exploratory trial or trials in a limited number of patients with the disease or medical condition for which it is intended to be used in order to i further identify any possible adverse side effects and safety risks  ii assess the preliminary or potential efficacy or biologic activity of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases or medical conditions  and iii assess dosage tolerance and determine the optimal dose for a subsequent phase ii or phase iii trial 
phase ii trials generally involve patients who are divided into one or more groups that will get one of several dose levels of the product candidate  and a control group that will not be treated with the product candidate and may receive a placebo or a drug already on the market for the same indication 
phase iii if and when one or more phase ii trials demonstrate that a specific dose or range of doses of a product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile  one or more phase iii trials are generally undertaken to further demonstrate or confirm clinical efficacy and to further evaluate the safety of the investigational drug in an expanded patient population with the goal of evaluating its overall risk benefit relationship 
phase iii trials will generally be designed to reach a specific goal or endpoint  the achievement of which is intended to demonstrate the product candidate s clinical efficacy 
the successful demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety in one or more phase iii trials is typically a prerequisite to the filing of a nda or bla for a product candidate 
in the case of product candidates being developed for serious or life threatening diseases  such as hiv and hcv  initial phase i human testing is often conducted in patients with the respective disease rather than in healthy volunteers 
these studies may provide initial evidence of efficacy traditionally obtained in phase ii clinical trials  and so these trials are frequently referred to as phase i ii clinical trials 
in addition  a company may hold an end of phase ii meeting with the fda to assess the safety of the dose regimen to be tested in the phase iii clinical trial  to evaluate the phase iii plan  and to identify any additional information that will be needed to support an nda 
if the phase iii clinical trials had been the subject of discussion at an end of phase meeting  the sponsor is eligible for a special protocol assessment  spa by the fda  a process by which the fda  at the request of the sponsor  will evaluate the trial protocol and issues relating to the protocol within days to assess whether it is adequate to meet scientific and regulatory requirements identified by the sponsor 
if the fda and the sponsor reach agreement on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in an nda  the fda will reduce the understanding to writing 
the spa  however  is not a guarantee of product approval by the fda or approval of any permissible claims about the product 
throughout the clinical phases of development  samples of the product candidate made in different batches are tested for stability to establish shelf life constraints 
in addition  large scale production protocols and written standard operating procedures for each aspect of commercial manufacture and testing must be developed 
phase i  ii  and iii testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period  if at all 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted under an ind and may  at its discretion  reevaluate  alter  suspend  or terminate further evaluation or trials based upon the data accumulated to that point and the fda s assessment of the risk benefit ratio to the subject or patient 
the fda or the sponsor may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for various reasons  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the fda can also request additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition to product approval 
additionally  new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of products under development 
furthermore  irbs  which are independent entities constituted to protect human subjects in the institutions in which clinical trials are being conducted  have the authority to suspend clinical trials in their respective institutions at any time for a variety of reasons  including safety issues 

table of contents we cannot be certain that we will successfully complete any phase i  phase ii or phase iii trials of our product candidates within any specific time period  if at all 
furthermore  we  the fda  an irb  or a data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health or safety risk 
certain information about clinical trials  including a description of the study  participation criteria  location of study sites  and contact information  shall be sent to the national institutes of health  nih for inclusion in a publicly accessible database that is available at www 
clinicaltrials 
gov 
sponsors also are subject to certain state laws imposing requirements to make publicly available certain information on clinical trial results 
in addition  the food and drug administration amendments act of directs the fda to issue regulations that will require sponsors to submit to the nih the results of all controlled clinical studies  other than phase i studies 
new drug and biologics license applications if and when our human clinical trials are completed with satisfactory clinical data  we must submit a nda or bla to the fda in order to obtain approval for the marketing and sale of a product candidate 
among many other items  a nda or bla typically includes the results of preclinical and toxicology studies and human clinical trials and a description of the manufacturing process and quality control methods 
the fda must approve the nda or bla prior to the marketing and sale of the related product 
the fda may deny a nda or bla if all applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied  or may require additional data  including clinical  toxicology  safety or manufacturing data 
the fda has days from its receipt of a nda or bla to review the application to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before accepting it for filing 
the fda may request additional information rather than accept a nda or bla for filing 
in this event  the nda or bla must be amended with the additional information 
the fda may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee  typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts  for review  evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee 
a nda or bla can receive either standard or priority review 
a drug candidate representing a potential by significant improvement in the treatment  prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review 
in addition  product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life threatening illnesses that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity 
as a condition of approval  the fda may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well controlled post marketing phase iv clinical trials 
priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval  but may expedite the approval process 
if the results of the fda evaluation of the nda or bla and inspection of manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda will issue an approval letter 
an approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for a specific indication 
as a condition of nda or bla approval  the fda may require post approval testing  including phase iv trials  and surveillance to monitor the drug s safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions  including labeling or distribution restrictions which can materially impact the potential market and profitability of the drug 
once granted  product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing 
if the fda determines that they cannot approve the application or abbreviated application in its present form a complete response letter will be issued 
a complete response letter will describe all of the specific deficiencies that the agency has identified in an application that must be met in order to secure final approval of the nda or bla 
if and when those conditions have been met to the fda s satisfaction  the fda will typically issue an approval letter 
however  even after submitting this additional information  the fda ultimately may decide 
table of contents that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval 
it can take several years for the fda to approve a nda or bla once it is submitted  and the actual time required for any product candidate may vary substantially  depending upon the nature  complexity and novelty of the product candidate 
we cannot be certain that the fda  or any other similar regulatory agency in other countries  will grant approval for any of our product candidates on a timely basis  if at all 
success in preclinical or early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
post approval regulations if and when a product candidate receives regulatory approval  the approval is typically limited to specific clinical indications 
further  even after regulatory approval is obtained  subsequent discovery of previously unknown safety problems with a product may result in restrictions on its use  or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market 
any fda approved products manufactured or distributed by us are subject to continuing regulation by the fda  including record keeping requirements and reporting of adverse events or experiences 
further  drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the fda and state agencies  and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and state agencies for compliance with cgmp regulations  which impose rigorous procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers 
we cannot be certain that we  or our present or future contract manufacturers or suppliers  will be able to comply with cgmp regulations and other fda regulatory requirements 
failure to comply with these requirements may result in  among other things  total or partial suspension of production activities  failure of the fda to grant approval for marketing  and withdrawal  suspension  or revocation of marketing approvals 
if the fda approves one or more of our product candidates  we or our collaborators and our contract manufacturers must provide the fda with certain updated safety  efficacy and manufacturing information 
product changes  as well as certain changes in the manufacturing process or facilities where the manufacturing occurs or other post approval changes may necessitate additional fda review and approval 
we rely  and expect to continue to rely  on third parties for the production and manufacture of clinical and commercial quantities of our products 
future fda and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution  or require substantial resources to correct 
the labeling  advertising  promotion  marketing and distribution of a drug or biologic product must also comply with fda and federal trade commission  ftc requirements which include  among others  standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising  off label promotion  industry sponsored scientific and educational activities  and promotional activities involving the internet 
the fda and ftc have very broad enforcement authority  and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties  including the issuance of a warning letter directing the company to correct deviations from regulatory standards and enforcement actions that can include seizures  fines  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
the fda s policies may change in the future and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates 
moreover  increased attention to the containment of health care costs in the united states and in foreign markets could result in new government regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we cannot predict the likelihood  nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action  either in the united states or abroad  or the impact such changes could have on our business 
once an approval is granted  the fda may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market 
after approval  some types of changes to the approved product  such as adding new indications  manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims  are subject to further fda review and approval 
in addition  the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized  and in some 
table of contents circumstances the fda has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post marketing programs 
from time to time  legislation is drafted  introduced and passed in congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval  manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the fda 
in addition  fda regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products 
it is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted  or fda regulations  guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes  if any  may be 
fast track drug status the fda has developed fast track policies  which provide for the potential for expedited review of a nda or bla 
however  there is no assurance that the fda will  in fact  accelerate the review process for a fast track product candidate 
fast track status is provided only for those new and novel therapies that are intended to treat persons with life threatening and severely debilitating diseases where there is a defined unmet medical need  especially where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or the new therapy is significantly superior to alternative therapies 
during the development of product candidates that qualify for this status  the fda may expedite consultations and reviews of these experimental therapies 
fast track status also provides for the potential for a priority review  whereby the fda agrees to reduce the time it takes to review a nda or bla 
the fda can base approval of a marketing application for a fast track product on a clinical endpoint or on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit 
the fda generally requires as a condition of the approval of an application for certain fast track products  additional post approval studies or phase iv clinical studies to validate the surrogate endpoint or confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint 
further  fast track status allows for a rolling nda or bla submission  whereby portions of the application can be submitted to the fda for review prior to the completion of the entire application 
a rolling submission could result in a reduction in the length of time it would otherwise take the fda to complete its review of the application 
fast track status may be revoked by the fda at any time if the clinical results of a trial fail to continue to support the assertion that the respective product candidate has the potential to address an unmet medical need 
in addition  fast track status may be granted for a specific application of a drug candidate 
aurexis has been granted fast track status 
foreign regulatory approval outside of the united states  our ability to market any of our existing or future product candidates will also be contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate foreign regulatory authorities whether or not fda approval has been obtained 
the foreign regulatory approval process in most industrialized countries generally includes risks that are similar to the fda approval process described herein 
the requirements governing conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorizations  and the time required to obtain requisite approvals may vary widely from country to country and differ from that required for fda approval 
under european union regulatory systems  we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure 
the centralized procedure  which is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes and optional for those which are highly innovative  provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states 
the decentralized procedure provides for a member state  known as the reference member state  to assess an application  with one or more other member states subsequently approving that assessment 
under this procedure  an applicant submits an application  or dossier  and related materials  including a draft summary of product characteristics  draft labeling and package leaflet  to the reference member state and concerned member states 
the reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within days after receipt of a valid application 
within days of receiving the reference member state s assessment report  each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials 
if a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health  the disputed points may eventually be referred to the european commission  whose decision is binding on all member states

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following discussion of risks  together with the other information contained in this form k 
the occurrence of any of the following risks could materially harm our business  our financial condition  and our ability to raise additional capital in the future or ever become profitable 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 
risks relating to our development of our product candidates all of our product candidates are in the early stages of development and remain subject to numerous clinical trials  preclinical studies and regulatory approval 
if we are unable to successfully develop our product candidates  our business will be materially harmed 
the failure to successfully develop one or more of our product candidates may have a material adverse effect on us  and possibly cause us to cease operations 
to date  we have not commercially marketed  distributed or sold any product candidates 
the success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to develop our product candidates through early stages of development and ultimately later commercialize our product candidates successfully 
we plan to initiate a phase ii clinical trial for fv in the second quarter of further  subject to completion of the requisite preclinical studies  we plan to file an ind for a lead hcv nucleoside polymerase clinical candidate in the first half of our product candidates must satisfy rigorous regulatory standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved for sale 
to satisfy these standards  we must engage in expensive and lengthy preclinical studies and clinical testing and obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates 
despite our efforts  our product candidates may not offer therapeutic or other benefits over existing  comparable drugs  be proven safe and effective in clinical trials  have the desired effects or may include undesirable or unexpected effects  meet applicable regulatory standards  
table of contents be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs  or be successfully commercialized by us or by collaborators 
even if we achieve success in preclinical studies and early stage clinical trials  there can be no assurance that later stage trials will be successful 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have experienced significant setbacks and failure in all stages of development  including late stage clinical trials  even after achieving promising results in preclinical testing or early stage clinical trials 
accordingly  results from completed preclinical studies and early stage clinical trials may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later stage trials 
our product candidates will require significant additional research and development efforts  substantial financial resources  and regulatory approvals prior to advancing into further clinical development or being commercialized by us or collaborators 
we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will successfully progress through the drug development process or will result in clinically or commercially viable products 
we do not expect any of our product candidates to be commercialized by us or collaborators for at least several years 
if we are unable to successfully develop our product candidates  our business will be materially harmed 
if preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates  including those that are subject to collaboration agreements  are unsuccessful or delayed  we could be delayed or precluded from further development and commercialization of our product candidates 
in order to further advance the development of and ultimately receive regulatory approval to sell our product candidates  we must conduct extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the fda or other regulatory authorities 
preclinical studies and clinical trials are expensive  complex  may take many years to complete  and have highly uncertain outcomes 
delays  setbacks or failures may occur at any time  or in any phase of preclinical or clinical development  including concerns about safety or toxicity  a lack of demonstrated efficacy or superior efficacy over other similar products that have been approved for sale or are in more advanced stages of development  poor study or trial design  and issues related to the manufacturing process of the materials used to conduct the trials 
the results of prior preclinical studies or clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of the results we may see in later stage clinical trials 
in many cases  product candidates in clinical development may fail to show desired safety and efficacy characteristics despite having successfully demonstrated so in preclinical studies or earlier stage clinical trials 
in addition  we may experience numerous unforeseen events during  or as a result of  preclinical studies and the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates  including regulators or irbs not authorizing us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site  enrollment in our clinical trials delayed or proceeding at a slower place than we expected or participants dropping out of our clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipated  resulting in significant delays  our third party contractors whom upon we rely on for conducting r preclinical studies or clinical trials may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner  having to suspend or ultimately terminate our clinical trials if participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks  irbs or regulators requiring that we hold  suspend or terminate our preclinical studies and clinical trials for various reasons  including noncompliance with regulatory requirements  and the supply or quality of material for our product candidates necessary to conduct our preclinical studies or being insufficient or inadequate 
even if the data collected from preclinical studies or clinical trials involving our product candidates satisfactorily demonstrate safety and efficacy  such results may not be sufficient to support the submission of an ind application and the initiation of clinical trials in humans or a nda or bla to obtain regulatory approval from the fda in the united states to sell the product 

table of contents we must comply with extensive government regulations in order to advance our product candidates through the clinical development process and ultimately obtain and maintain marketing approval for our products in the united states and abroad 
product candidates that we receive regulatory fda approval to advance through clinical development and ultimately sell are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic and foreign government regulation 
in the united states the fda regulates  among other things  the development  testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  record keeping  labeling  storage  approval  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
our product candidates are also subject to similarly extensive regulation by foreign governments to the extent we seek to develop or market them in those countries 
we or our collaborators must provide the fda and foreign regulatory authorities  if applicable  with preclinical and clinical data that appropriately demonstrate our product candidates safety and efficacy before they can be approved for the targeted indications 
none of our product candidates have been approved for sale in the united states or any foreign market  and we cannot predict whether we will obtain regulatory approval for any product candidate we are developing or plan to develop 
the regulatory review and approval process can take many years  is dependent upon the type  complexity  novelty of  and medical need for the product  requires the expenditure of substantial resources  involves post marketing surveillance and vigilance  and involves ongoing requirements for post marketing studies or phase iv clinical trials 
in addition  we or our collaborators may encounter delays in or fail to gain regulatory approval for our product candidates based upon additional governmental regulation resulting from future legislative or administrative action or changes in fda policy or interpretation during the period of product development 
delays or failures in obtaining regulatory approval to advance our product candidates through clinical development and ultimately commercialize them may adversely affect our ability to further develop or commercialize any of our product candidates  diminish any competitive advantages that we or our collaborators may have or attain  and adversely affect the receipt of milestone payments and royalties from the sale of our products or product revenues 
furthermore  any regulatory approvals  if granted  may later be withdrawn 
if we or our collaborators fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any time  or if post approval safety concerns arise  we or our collaborators may be subject to restrictions or a number of actions  including delays  suspension or termination of clinical trials related to our products  refusal by the fda to review pending applications or supplements to approved applications  product recalls or seizures  suspension of manufacturing  withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications  and fines  civil penalties and criminal prosecutions 
additionally  we or our collaborators may voluntarily halt the development of product candidate or withdraw any approved product from the market if we believe that it may pose an unacceptable safety risk to patients  or if the product candidate or approved product no longer meets our business objectives 
the ability to develop or market a pharmaceutical product outside of the united states is contingent upon receiving appropriate authorization from the respective foreign regulatory authorities 
foreign regulatory approval processes typically include many  if not all  of the risks associated with the fda process  as described above and may include additional risks 
we have limited experience in the development of small molecule antiviral product candidates and therefore may encounter difficulties developing our product candidates or managing our operations in the future 
we have acquired or licensed several antiviral drug development programs that are based upon chemical compounds  also referred to as small molecules 
historically  we have focused our resources on the 
table of contents development and commercialization of antibody based product candidates  which are composed of biologic materials and are generally considered to be large molecules 
therefore  we have limited experience in the discovery  development and manufacturing of small molecule antiviral compounds 
in order to successfully develop our antiviral pipeline we must supplement our research  clinical development  regulatory  medicinal chemistry  virology and manufacturing functions through the addition of key employees  consultants or third party contractors to provide certain capabilities and skill sets that we previously did not possess  including but not limited to virology  medicinal chemistry  drug formulation and pharmacology 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain such qualified employees  consultants or third party contractors with appropriate small molecule antiviral drug development experience 
in the event we cannot attract such capabilities or successfully develop our antiviral pipeline or manage  our business could be materially harmed 
if we are unable to retain or  in the future  attract key employees  advisors or consultants  we may be unable to successfully develop our product candidates or otherwise manage our business effectively 
our success depends in part on our ability to retain qualified management and personnel  and directors  academic scientists and clinicians as advisors or consultants 
we are currently highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and senior management 
in order to develop our clinical stage and preclinical development programs  we need to retain or attract certain personnel  consultants or advisors with experience in a number of disciplines  including research and development  clinical testing  government regulation of pharmaceuticals  manufacturing and chemistry  business development  accounting  finance  human resources and information systems 
although we have not had material difficulties in retaining key personnel in the past  we may not be able to continue to do so in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we lose any key employees  or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel  advisors or consultants  our business may be harmed 
if third party vendors upon whom we rely to conduct our preclinical studies or clinical trials do not perform or fail to comply with strict regulations  these studies or trials for our product candidates may be terminated  delayed  or fail 
we have limited resources dedicated to conducting and managing preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we have historically relied and intend to continue to rely on third parties  including clinical research organizations  consultants and principal investigators  to assist us in managing  monitoring and conducting our clinical trails and preclinical studies 
we rely on these vendors and individuals to perform many facets of the development process  including preclinical studies  the recruitment of sites and patients for participation in our clinical trials  maintenance of positive relations with the clinical sites and to ensure that these sites are conducting our trials in compliance with the trial protocol and applicable regulations 
if these third parties fail to perform satisfactorily or do not adequately fulfill their obligations under the terms of our agreements with them  we may not be able to enter into alternative arrangements without undue delay or additional expenditures  and therefore the preclinical studies and clinical trails of our product candidates may be delayed or prove unsuccessful 
further  the fda may inspect some of the clinical sites participating in our clinical trials  or our third party vendors sites  to determine if our clinical trials are being conducted according to cgp practices 
if we or the fda determine that our third party vendors are not in compliance with  or have not conducted our clinical trials according to applicable regulations  we may be forced to delay  repeat or terminate such clinical trials 
any delay  repetition or termination of our clinical trials and preclinical studies could be very costly  result in the elimination of a development program  and materially harm our business 
if third party contract manufacturers  upon whom we rely to manufacture our product candidates  do not perform  fail to manufacture according to our specifications or fail to comply with strict regulations  our preclinical studies or clinical trials and the development of our product candidates could be terminated  delayed  or adversely affected 
we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities 
we have historically contracted with third party contract manufacturers to produce the clinical and preclinical materials we use to test our product candidates in development  and we intend to continue to rely on third party contract manufacturers  at least for the 
table of contents foreseeable future  to manufacture these clinical and preclinical materials 
our reliance on third party contract manufacturers exposes us to a number of risks  any of which could delay or prevent the completion of clinical trials or preclinical studies  the regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates  result in higher costs  or deprive us of potential product revenues 
some of these risks include the manufacture of products requires compliance with numerous and strict safety  quality and regulatory standards 
our contract manufacturers may not produce our product candidates according to their own standards  our specifications  current good manufacturing procedures  cgmp or may otherwise manufacture material that we or the fda may deem to be unusable in our clinical trials  our contract manufacturers may be unable to increase the scale of  or increase the capacity for  our product candidates  we may experience a shortage in supply  or the cost to manufacture our products may increase to the point where it adversely affects the cost of our products 
we cannot assure you that our contract manufacturers will be able to manufacture our products at a suitable scale  or we will be able to find alternative manufacturers acceptable to us that can do so  our third party contract manufacturers may place a priority on the manufacture of their own products  or other customers products  our contract manufacturers may fail to perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business  our manufacturers plants may be closed as a result of regulatory sanctions or a natural disaster 
drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic inspections by the fda  the united states drug enforcement administration  dea and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with fda mandated cgmps  other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
while we are obligated to audit their performance  we do not have control over our third party contract manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
failure by our third party manufacturers  or us  to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us or the drug manufacturer from the production of other third party products 
these sanctions include fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of the government to grant pre market approval of drugs  delays  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  seizures or recalls of product  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business 
in the event that we need to change our third party contract manufacturers  our preclinical studies or clinical trials  and the development of our products candidates could be delayed  adversely affected or terminated  or such a change may result in higher costs 
due to regulatory restrictions inherent in an ind  nda or bla  the manufacture of our product candidates may be sole sourced 
in accordance with cgmps  changing manufacturers may require the re validation of the manufacturing processes and procedures and may require further clinical trials or preclinical studies 
changing our current or future contract manufacturers may be difficult for us and could be costly  which could result in our inability to manufacture our product candidates for an extended period of time 
our product candidates may have undesirable side effects when used alone or in combination with other products that may prevent their regulatory approval or limit their use if approved 
we must demonstrate the safety of our product candidates to obtain regulatory approval to advance their clinical development or to market them 
in clinical trials and preclinical studies conducted to date  our product candidates have generally been well tolerated  although these studies and trials have involved a small number of subjects or patients 
we may observe adverse or significant adverse events in future clinical trials or preclinical studies of these product candidates 
any side effects associated with our product candidates in development may outweigh their potential benefit and result in the termination of the development program  prevent regulatory approval or limit their market acceptance if they are ultimately approved 

table of contents our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological changes 
as a result  we may be unable to compete successfully or develop innovative products  which could harm our business 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change as researchers learn more about genetics and develop new technologies and scientific approaches to treating and preventing disease 
our current and potential competitors generally include  among others  major multi national pharmaceutical companies  large  medium and small biotechnology firms  universities and other research institutions 
some of the large pharmaceutical companies that currently market products that would compete with our product candidates include  but are not limited to glaxosmithkline  novartis and merck in the shingles market  roche and schering plough in the hepatitis c market  and pfizer  glaxosmithkline  bristol meyers squibb  johnson johnson  abbott  merck and gilead in the hiv market 
in addition  there are several other competitors developing product candidates  particularly in the hcv market that may compete with our product candidates in the future 
most of these companies and institutions  either alone or together with their collaborators  have substantially greater financial or corporate resources and larger research and development staffs than we do 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborators  have significantly greater experience than we do in discovering  developing  manufacturing and marketing products  particularly those based upon small molecules 
future successful developments by others may render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
we also face  and will continue to face  intense competition from other companies for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  for in licensing technology from or otherwise establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for attracting investigators and clinical sites capable of conducting our clinical trials 
these competitors  either alone or with their collaborators  may succeed in developing technologies or products that are safer  more effective  less expensive or easier to administer than ours 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in obtaining fda or other regulatory approvals for their product candidates more rapidly than we can 
companies that complete clinical trials  obtain required regulatory approvals and commercialize their products before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage  including certain patent and fda marketing exclusivity rights that could delay the ability of competitors to market certain products 
we cannot assure you that product candidates resulting from our research and development efforts  or from joint efforts with our collaborators  will be able to compete successfully with our competitors existing products or products under development 
we have experienced operating losses since our inception 
we expect to continue to incur such losses for the foreseeable future and we may never become profitable 
since inception may  and through december   we have incurred a cumulative deficit of approximately million 
our losses to date have resulted principally from costs related to our research programs and the clinical development of our product candidates  and general and administrative costs relating to supporting our operations 
we anticipate incurring losses from operations for the foreseeable future  as we continue to conduct significant research and laboratory testing  conduct extensive and expensive clinical trials  and seek regulatory approvals 
we cannot assure you that we will ever generate direct or royalty revenue from the sale of products  or ever become profitable 
based on our current strategy  our quarterly and annual operating costs and revenues may become highly volatile  and comparisons to previous periods will be difficult to make 
our revenues  expenses and results of operations will be subject to significant fluctuations  which will make it difficult to compare our operating results from period to period 
until we have or our collaborators successfully developed one of our product candidates  we expect that substantially all of our revenue will result from payments we receive under collaborative arrangements or license agreements where we grant others the right to use our intellectual property or know how 
we may not be able to generate additional revenues under existing or future collaborative agreements 
furthermore  payments potentially due to us under our existing and any future collaborative arrangements  including any 
table of contents milestone and up front payments  are intermittent in nature and are subject to significant fluctuation in both timing and amount  or may never be earned or paid 
further  some of our collaboration arrangements allow our partner to terminate the agreement on relatively short notice 
therefore  our historical and current revenues may not be indicative of our ability to achieve additional payment generating milestones in the future 
we expect that our operating results will also vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result of the initiation  success or failure of preclinical studies or clinical trials  the timing of the manufacture of our product candidates or other development related factors 
accordingly  our revenues and results of operations for any period may not be comparable to the revenues or results of operations for any other period 
we do not have significant internal drug discovery capabilities  and therefore  we are dependent on in licensing intellectual property and early stage development programs from third parties for additional product candidates for our pipeline 
we do not have significant internal discovery capabilities and at this time  we do not intend to build such capabilities in the near future 
accordingly  in order to generate and expand our development pipeline  we have relied  and will continue to rely on obtaining discoveries  new technologies and compounds from third parties through sponsored research or in licensing arrangements 
we may face substantial competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  many of which may have greater resources then we have  in obtaining these in licensing or sponsored research opportunities 
additional in licensing opportunities may not be available to us  or if available  the terms may not be acceptable 
in licensed compounds that appear promising in discovery or research studies may fail to progress into product candidates  or ever advance into preclinical development or clinical trials at all 
our research and development efforts may not lead to the discovery of any additional product candidates that would be suitable for further preclinical or clinical development 
the discovery of additional product candidates requires significant time  as well as a substantial commitment of personnel and financial resources 
there is a great deal of uncertainty inherent in our research efforts and  as a consequence  our ability to fill our product pipeline with additional product candidates may not be successful 
the reporting requirements of being a publicly traded company increase our overall operating costs and subject us to increased regulatory risk 
as a publicly traded company  we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act  the sarbanes oxley act of and the listing requirements of the nasdaq stock market llc 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures 
in particular  we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  which is expensive and requires the attention of our limited management resources 
the various financial reporting  legal  corporate governance and other obligations associated with being a publicly traded company require us to incur significant expenditures and place additional demands on our management  administrative  operational  and finance resources 
if we are unable to comply with these requirements in a timely and effective manner  we and or our executive officers may be subject to sanctions by the sec  and our ability to raise additional funds in the future maybe impaired and ultimately effect our business 
we will continue to incur additional expenses as a result of being a publicly traded company 
if a product liability claim is brought against us  our ability to assert a federal preemption defense may be limited 
in the recent case of wyeth v 
levine  the united states supreme court rejected a pharmaceutical company s argument that certain failure to warn claims alleging deficiencies in its labeling were preempted by federal law because the fda approved the labels 
although the court s decision was limited to the facts of that case  if any of our products are approved for sale by the fda and commercialized  this decision may limit our ability to assert a federal preemption defense in any product liability suit which may be brought in the future against such product 

table of contents if a product liability claim is successfully brought against us for uninsured liabilities or such claim exceeds our insurance coverage  we could be forced to pay substantial damage awards 
the use of any of our existing or future product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any approved products may expose us to product liability claims 
we currently have product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials in the amount of million 
in the event any of our product candidates are approved for sale by the fda and commercialized  we may need to increase our product liability coverage 
such insurance coverage may not protect us against any or all of the product liability claims that may be brought against us in the future 
we may not be able to acquire or maintain adequate insurance coverage at a commercially reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against potential losses 
in the event a product liability claim is brought against us  we may be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim  as well as uncovered damage awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us 
defending any product liability claim or claims could require us to expend significant financial and managerial resources  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
if our use of hazardous materials results in contamination or injury  we could suffer significant financial loss 
our research and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials and medical waste 
notwithstanding the regulations controlling the use and disposal of these materials and the safety procedures we undertake  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of an accident or environmental discharge or exposure  we may be held liable for any resulting damages  which may exceed our financial resources and have an adverse effect on our business 
risks relating to the commercialization of our product candidates we may delay or terminate the development of a product candidate if the perceived market or commercial opportunity does not justify further investment  which could materially harm our business 
even though the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials that we conduct may support further development of one or more of our drug candidates  we may delay  suspend or terminate the future development of a product candidate at any time for strategic  business  or financial liquidity reasons  including the determination or belief that the emerging profile of the product candidate is such that it may not gain meaningful acceptance  not generate a significant return to shareholders  or otherwise provide any competitive advantages in its intended indication or market 
if the actual or perceived therapeutic benefits of fv are not sufficiently different from existing generic drugs used to treat shingles  we may terminate the development of fv at any time  or our ability to generate significant revenue from the sale of fv  if approved  may be limited and our potential profitability could be harmed 
valacyclovir  famciclovir and acyclovir are existing drugs use to treat shingles patients 
famciclovir and acyclovir are generic drugs  and valacyclovir  will become a generic drug in generic drugs are drugs whose patent protection has expired  and generally have an average selling price substantially lower than drugs protected by intellectually property rights 
unless a patented drug can differentiate itself from a generic drug treating the same condition or disease in a meaningful manner  the existence of generic competition in any indication can impose significant pricing pressure on competing drugs 
accordingly  if at any time we believe that fv may not provide meaningful therapeutic benefits  perceived or real  over these existing generic drugs  we may terminate or delay its future development 
we cannot provide any assurance that later stage clinical trials of fv will demonstrate therapeutic benefits over existing generic drugs 

table of contents if we fail to enter into collaborations or other sales  marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties to commercialize our product candidates  or otherwise fail to establish marketing and sales capabilities  we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products 
we currently have no infrastructure to support the commercialization of any of our product candidates  and have little  if any  experience in the commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
therefore  if our product candidates are approved  our future profitability will depend largely on our ability to access or develop suitable sales and marketing capabilities 
we anticipate that we will need to establish relationships with other companies  through license and collaborations agreements to commercialize our product candidates in north america and in other countries around the world 
to the extent that we enter into these license and collaboration agreements  or marketing and sales arrangements with other companies to sell  promote or market our products in the united states or abroad  our product revenues  which may be in the form of indirect revenue  a royalty  or a split of profits  will depend largely on their efforts  which may not be successful 
the development of a third party sales force and marketing capabilities may result in us incurring significant costs before the time that we may generate significant revenues 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified third parties or marketing or sales personnel  or be able to establish marketing capabilities or an effective sales force 
we may be unable to successfully develop product candidates that are the subject of collaborations if our collaborators do not perform  terminate our agreements  or delay the development of our product candidates 
we have in the past and expect to continue to enter into and rely on license and collaboration agreements or other business arrangements with third parties to further develop and or commercialize our existing and future product candidates 
such collaborators or partners may not perform as agreed  fail to comply with strict regulations or elect to delay or terminate their efforts in developing or commercializing our product candidates  even though we have performed our obligations under the arrangement 
we cannot assure you that any product candidates will emerge from our relationships with wyeth or any other license or collaboration agreements we may enter into in the future related to any of our product candidates 
if government and third party payers fail to provide adequate reimbursement or coverage for our products or those we develop through collaborations  our revenues and potential for profitability will be harmed 
in the united states and most foreign markets  our product revenues and therefore the inherent value of our product candidates will depend largely upon the reimbursement rates established by third party payers for such product candidates or products 
such third party payers include government health administration authorities  managed care providers  private health insurers and other organizations 
these third party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products  services and pharmaceuticals 
in addition  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status  if any  of newly approved drugs or pharmaceutical products 
we may need to conduct post marketing clinical trials in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our products 
such studies may require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources 
we cannot assure you that any product candidates will be reimbursed in part  or at all  by any third party payers 
domestic and foreign governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare  including pharmaceutical drugs 
in some foreign markets  governments control prescription drugs pricing and profitability 
in the united states  we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental control 
in addition  increasing emphasis on managed care and government intervention in the united states healthcare system will continue to put downward pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any of our product candidates in the future  which would limit our revenues and profitability 
accordingly  legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceutical products may change before our product candidates are approved for sale  which could further limit or eliminate reimbursement rates for our product candidates 

table of contents if any product candidates that we develop independently or through collaborations are approved but do not gain meaningful acceptance in their intended markets  we are not likely to generate significant revenues or become profitable 
even if our product candidates are successfully developed and we or a partner or collaborator obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to sell them in the future  they may not gain market acceptance or utilization among physicians or patients 
the degree of market acceptance that any of our product candidates may achieve will depend on a number of factors  including the therapeutic efficacy or perceived benefit of the product  the level of reimbursement available to cover the cost of the product  the cost of the product to the user or payer  the product s potential advantages over existing or alternative therapies  the actual or perceived safety of similar classes of products  the effectiveness of sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  and the scope of the product label approved by the fda 
there can be no assurance that physicians will choose to administer our products to the intended patient population 
if our products do not achieve meaningful market acceptance  or if the market for our products proves to be smaller than anticipated  we may not generate significant revenues or ever become profitable 
even if we or our collaborator achieve market acceptance for our products  we may experience downward pricing pressure on the price of our products due to generic competition and social or political pressure to lower the cost of drugs 
several fda approved products are already available in generic form or face patent expiration in the next several years in certain markets and indications we are pursuing  including therapies for the treatment of shingles and hiv 
we expect to face competition from these generic drugs  including significant price based competition 
further  pressure from social activist groups whose goal it is to reduce the cost of drugs  particularly in less developed nations  may also put downward pressure on the prices of drugs  which could result in downward pressure on those prices as well 
if conflicts arise between our collaborators and us  our collaborators may act in their best interest and not in our best interest  which could adversely affect our business 
conflicts may arise with our collaborators if they pursue alternative therapies for the same diseases that are targeted by intellectual property rights we have licensed to them 
competing products  developed by our existing or future collaborators may result in development delays or the withdrawal of their support for our product candidates 
additionally  conflicts may arise if there is a dispute about the progress of  or other activities related to  the clinical development of a product candidate  the achievement and payment of a milestone amount or the ownership of intellectual property that is developed during the course of the collaborative arrangement 
similarly  we may disagree with a collaborator as to which party owns newly developed intellectual property 
should an agreement be terminated as a result of a dispute and before we have realized the benefits of the collaboration  we may not be able to obtain revenues that we anticipated receiving 
if we are unable to adequately protect or expand our intellectual property  our business prospects could be harmed 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights and patents  or rights to intellectual property and patents  and maintain their validity  protect our trade secrets  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights or patents 

table of contents we will be able to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
the patent position of drug and biopharmaceutical companies involves complex legal and factual questions  and  therefore  we cannot predict with certainty whether we will be able to ultimately enforce our patents or proprietary rights 
therefore  any issued patents that we own or have rights to may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and may not provide us with the protection against competitors that we anticipate 
the degree of future protection for our proprietary intellectual property rights is uncertain because issued patents and other legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage 
for example we  or our licensors might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our or our licensors pending patent applications and issued patents  and we may have to engage in expensive and protracted interference proceedings to determine priority of invention  our  or our licensors pending patent applications may not result in issued patents  our  or our licensors issued patents may not provide a basis for commercially viable products or may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties  and third parties may design around our or our licensors patent claims to produce competitive products which fall outside the scope of our or our licensors patents 
because of the extensive time required for the development  testing and regulatory review of a product candidate  it is possible that before any of our product candidates can be approved for sale and commercialized  our relevant patent rights may expire or such patent rights may remain in force for only a short period following commercialization 
patent expiration could adversely affect our ability to protect future product development and  consequently  our operating results and financial position 
also  patent rights may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technologies 
the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and those countries may lack adequate rules and procedures for defending our intellectual property rights 
for example  we may not be able to prevent a third party from infringing our patents in a country that does not recognize or enforce patent rights  or that imposes compulsory licenses on or restricts the prices of life saving drugs 
changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the united states and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property 
we may not develop or obtain rights to products or processes that are patentable 
even if we or our licensors do obtain patents  such patents may not adequately protect the products or technologies we own or have licensed 
in addition  we may not have total control over the patent prosecution of subject matter that we license from others 
accordingly  we may be unable to exercise the same degree of control over this intellectual property as we would over our own 
others may challenge  seek to invalidate  infringe or circumvent any pending or issued patents we own or license  and rights we receive under those issued patents may not provide competitive advantages to us 
we cannot assure you as to the degree of protection that will be afforded by any of our issued or pending patents  or those licensed by us 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we seek to protect these  in part  through confidentiality and non disclosure agreements 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our technology or adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information 
failure to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know how could seriously impair our competitive position and harm our business 
we may become involved in costly litigation in order to enforce patent rights or protect trade secrets or know how that we own or license 

table of contents if a third party claims we are infringing on its intellectual property rights  we could incur significant expenses  or be prevented from further developing or commercializing our product candidates 
our success will largely depend on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary intellectual property rights of third parties 
this is generally referred to as having the freedom to operate 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property claims  united states patent and trademark office interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings  both in the united states and internationally  involve complex legal and factual questions 
as a result  such proceedings are lengthy  costly and time consuming and their outcome is highly uncertain 
we may become involved in litigation in order to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others  or to determine whether we have the freedom to operate with respect to the intellectual property rights of others 
patent applications in the united states are  in most cases  maintained in secrecy until months after the patent application is filed 
the publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made 
therefore  patent applications relating to products similar to our product candidates may have already been filed by others without our knowledge 
in the event an infringement claim is brought against us  we may be required to pay substantial legal fees and other expenses to defend such a claim and  if we are unsuccessful in defending the claim  we may be prevented from pursuing the development and commercialization of a product candidate and may be subject to injunctions and or damage awards 
if we become involved in any patent litigation  interference or other legal proceedings  we will incur substantial expense  and the efforts of our technical and management personnel will be significantly diverted 
a negative outcome of such litigation or proceedings may expose us to loss of our proprietary position or to significant liabilities  or require us to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
we may be restricted or prevented from developing  manufacturing and selling our product candidates in the event of an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding  or if we fail to obtain necessary licenses 
our current and future product candidates may be covered by third party patents or other intellectual property rights  in which case we would need to obtain a license or sublicense to these rights in order to have the appropriate freedom to further develop or commercialize them 
any required licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we do not obtain the required licenses or sublicenses  we could encounter delays in the development of our product candidates  or be prevented from developing  manufacturing and commercializing our product candidates at all 
if it is determined that we have infringed an issued patent and do not have the freedom to operate  we could be subject to injunctions  and or compelled to pay significant damages  including punitive damages 
in cases where we have in licensed intellectual property  our failure to comply with the terms and conditions of such agreements could harm our business 
risks related to owning our common stock due to current worldwide economic and business conditions  the biotechnology business model may fall out of favor with investors and the industry may undergo a significant transformation 
as such  existing or planned operations of many companies may be restructured  rationalized  postponed  terminated or consolidated in order to conserve cash resources or optimize declining asset values 
if we are unable to raise capital due to these business conditions  our business may be harmed 
traditionally  biotechnology companies whose product candidates are in the development stage do not generate positive cash flow from operations  and have funded their operations for many years through the issuance of equity or through proceeds from license agreements or collaborations with larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies 
in light of the current economic conditions  many biotechnology companies  particularly those most advanced programs are in the preclinical or early clinical stage of development  have not been able to access capital on reasonable terms  or at all  and believe they may not be able to access such capital in the near future 
accordingly  many have postponed or terminated one or more development programs  or have 
table of contents restructured or terminated operations altogether in order to conserve or maximize their cash resources 
further  the industry may consolidate into fewer well capitalized companies with greater cash resources and a highly rationalized pipeline 
we may not be able to access capital in the future  which may cause us to restructure  postpone or terminate some or all operations  or rationalize our programs and consolidate our operations with those of other companies to support future development 
in order to develop our product candidates and support our operations beyond the next months  we expect that we will need to raise additional capital 
such capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  which could materially harm our business and business prospects  and your investment could suffer a decline in value 
we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments as of december   together with proceeds we expect to receive from existing license and collaboration agreements will enable us to operate for a period of at least months 
we have no other committed sources of additional capital at this time 
given the current conditions in the capital market markets  we cannot assure you that funds will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available to us at all or  on terms that we find acceptable we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate research and development efforts or clinical trials on any or all of our product candidates 
we may also be forced to curtail  restructure  sale  merge  or liquidate our operations  or obtain funds by entering into arrangements with licensees  collaborators or partners on unattractive terms  or sell or relinquish rights to certain technologies  product candidates or our intellectual property that we would not otherwise sell or relinquish in order to continue operations or the development of our product candidates 
the timing and extent of our future financing needs will depend on many factors  some of which are very difficult to predict and others that are beyond our control  including our ability to successfully advance the development of our drug candidates and programs  the time and cost to complete the requisite preclinical studies  clinical trials and receive regulatory approval to advance our product candidates through the additional phases of clinical development  the amount of future payments  if any  received or made under existing or future license  collaboration or similar arrangements  and the costs associated with protecting or expanding our patent and other intellectual property rights  the price of our common stock price has been highly volatile  and your investment in us could suffer a decline in value 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile since the completion of our initial public offering in june the market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors and events  including but not limited to our ability to successfully advance our product candidates through preclinical and clinical development activities  disclosure of any favorable or unfavorable data from our clinical trials or preclinical studies  or other regulatory developments concerning our clinical trials  manufacturing or product candidates or those of our competitors  our ability to manage our cash burn rate at an acceptable or planned level  the approval or commercialization of new products by us or our competitors  and the disclosure thereof  announcements of scientific innovations by us or our competitors  rumors relating to us or our competitors  public concern about the safety of our product candidates  or similar classes of products  
table of contents litigation to which we may become subject  actual or anticipated variations in our annual and quarterly operating results  changes in general conditions or trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  changes in drug reimbursement rates or government policies related to such reimbursement  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  new regulatory legislation adopted in the united states or abroad  changes in patent legislation in the united states or abroad our failure to achieve or meet equity research analysts expectations or their estimates of our business or prospects  or a change in their recommendations concerning us  the value of our common stock or our industry in general  termination or delay in any of our existing or future collaborative arrangements  future sales of equity or debt securities in connection with raising capital  the sale of shares held by our directors or management  the loss of our eligibility to have shares of our common stock traded on the nasdaq capital market due to our failure to maintain minimum listing standards  changes in accounting principles  failure to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of publicly owned companies  under the exchange act  as amended  and the sarbanes oxley act of  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market in general  and more specifically the nasdaq markets and the market for biotechnology stocks in particular  have historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
volatility in the market price for a particular biotechnology company s stock has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of that company 
market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
due to this volatility  investors may be unable to sell their shares of our common stock at or above the price they paid  which could generate sizable losses 
we currently do not meet the standards for continued listing on the nasdaq capital market  and we cannot provide any assurance that we will meet these standards in the future 
if we are delisted from this exchange  the value of your investment may substantially decrease 
on october  and again on december   we received notification from nasdaq that it had suspended for a three month period  the enforcement of the rules requiring a minimum closing bid price or a minimum market value of publicly held shares 
nasdaq stated that it would not take any action to delist any security for these concerns during the suspension period 
nasdaq has stated that  given the current extraordinary market conditions  this suspension will remain in effect through april  as a result of this suspension  we now have until july  to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule 
as a result of the suspension  if  at any time before july   the bid price of our common stock closes at per share or more for a minimum of consecutive business days  nasdaq will provide written notification that we have achieved compliance with the minimum bid price rule 
if we do not regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule by july   nasdaq will provide written notification that our securities will be delisted 
at that time  we may appeal nasdaq s determination to delist its securities to a listing qualifications panel 
any delisting from the nasdaq capital market may 
table of contents adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  significantly limit the liquidity of our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional funds 
future issuances of shares of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline  even if our business is doing well 
the issuance of a significant number of shares of our common stock  or the perception that such future sales could occur  particularly with respect to sales by our directors  executive officers  and other insiders or their affiliates  could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities at a price we deem appropriate 
if we raise additional capital in the future  your ownership in us could be diluted 
we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital in the future to support and fund our current strategy and planned operations 
any issuance of additional equity we may undertake in the future could cause the price of our common stock to decline  or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower than that paid by holders of our common stock in the past  which would result in those shares being dilutive 
if we obtain funds through a credit facility or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities  these securities would likely have rights senior to your rights as a common stockholder  which could impair the value of our common stock 
insiders and affiliates continue to have substantial control over us  which could delay or prevent a change in control 
as of december   our directors and executive officers  together with their affiliates  beneficially owned  in the aggregate  approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  may have the ability to delay or prevent a change in control that may be favored by other stockholders and otherwise exercise significant influence over all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  irrespective of how our other stockholders may vote  including the appointment of directors  the appointment  change or termination of management  any amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws  the approval of acquisitions or mergers and other significant corporate transactions  including a sale of substantially all of our assets  or the defeat of any non negotiated takeover attempt that might otherwise benefit the public stockholders 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  our amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent a change in our control or our management 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws and the laws of delaware  the state in which we are incorporated  may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of us or a change in management that stockholders may consider favorable 
these provisions establish a classified  or staggered  board of directors  so that not all members of our board may be elected at one time  set limitations on the removal of directors  limit who may call a special meeting of stockholders  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  and 
table of contents provide our board of directors with the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to remove and elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

the following discussion contains assumptions  estimates and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under risk factors  special note on forward looking statements and elsewhere in this form k 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of differentiated anti infective products to prevent and treat serious infections 
we are currently targeting our efforts and resources on the development of small molecule antiviral compounds  and in particular  therapies to treat shingles herpes zoster and infections caused by hepatitis c virus  hcv 
many currently available antiviral therapies have various therapeutic limitations  such as inadequate potency  diminishing efficacy due to the emergence of drug resistant viruses  toxic or adverse side effects  complex dosing schedules  and inconvenient routes of administration 
we believe that our drug candidates may have the potential to address a number of these limitations and unmet needs in their respective  intended indications 
we have neither received regulatory approval for any of our product candidates  nor do we have any commercialization capabilities  therefore  it is possible that we may never successfully derive significant collaboration revenues or any product revenues from any of our existing or future preclinical development programs or product candidates 
we expect that  for the foreseeable future  our operations will result in a net loss on a quarterly and yearly basis 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we are incorporated in the state of delaware since may financial operations overview revenue 
we have generated revenues from the licensing of our products  but do not expect substantial product related revenues until we or our collaborators obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates 
our revenues represent the amortization of up front license fees and periodic research and development support payments we have received in connection with license and collaboration agreements 
if our or any of our existing or future collaborators development efforts result in regulatory approval and the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates  we expect the majority of our future revenues would then result from upfront license fees  milestones  royalties  or other product revenue agreements 
in  we expect our revenues will decrease as m discontinued its efforts to commercialize antibody based diagnostics 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of the costs incurred to license  develop  test and manufacture our product candidates 
these costs consist primarily of research activities and preclinical studies and supplies associated with development activities by internal staff  professional fees paid to third party service providers in conjunction with treating patients enrolled in our clinical trials and monitoring  accumulating and evaluating the related data  salaries and personnel related expenses for our internal staff  including share based compensation  the cost of product candidates  including contract manufacturing services  legal fees associated with patents and intellectual property  consulting  depreciation  license and sponsored research fees paid to third parties  and laboratory facility costs 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 

table of contents in process research and development expense 
in connection with the acquisition of fermavir in  we recorded an in process research and development ipr d charge of million during the third quarter of the acquired ipr d project is fv  a compound in development for the treatment of shingles  or herpes zoster  which is caused by the varicella zoster virus vzv 
the cmv program we obtained in connection with the acquisition did not qualify as a project for ipr d purposes  and was therefore excluded from the purchase price allocation 
the fair value of the ipr d project was determined utilizing the income approach  assuming that the rights to the ipr d project will be sublicensed in the future to third parties in exchange for certain upfront  milestone and royalty payments  and that the combined company will have no further involvement in the ongoing development and commercialization of the projects at some point in the future 
under the income approach  the expected future net cash flows from sublicensing the ipr d project are estimated  risk adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in the development process and discounted to their net present value 
because the acquired ipr d project was in the early stages of the development cycle at the time and had no alternative future use  the amount allocated to ipr d was recorded as an expense immediately upon completion of the acquisition 
the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended december  and direct external costs represent expenses paid to third parties that specifically relate to product candidates in preclinical or clinical development  such as the costs to acquire programs  payments to third parties that perform development services  such as the toxicological tests  contract research organizations that monitor  accumulate and analyze data from our clinical trials  investigators who treat the patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the cost of chemistry  formulation and manufacturing materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
all remaining research and development expenses  such as salaries and personnel related expenses  supplies  depreciation  patent services  consulting  general licenses  facility costs and other overhead expense  are not tracked to a specific product development program and are included in unallocated costs and overhead 
research and development spending for past periods is not necessarily indicative of spending in future periods 
years ended december  in millions direct external costs fv preclinical programs unallocated costs and overhead total research and development expenses for the year ended december   fv includes direct external costs of million of in process research and development expense incurred in connection with the acquisition of fermavir 
we anticipate that our research and development costs will increase in  as compared to our expenses for  due to our development plans for fv and our hcv preclinical program 
due to the uncertainty regarding the timing and regulatory approval of clinical trials and preclinical studies  our future expenditures are likely to be highly volatile in future periods depending on the outcomes 
from time to time  we will make determinations as to how much funding to direct to these programs in response to their scientific  clinical and regulatory success  anticipated market opportunity and the availability of capital to fund our programs 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of our existing or future product candidates  if at all  and some of the possible consequences of failing to do so  is set forth in the risk factors section of this form k 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related expenses  including share based compensation for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  information technology  business development and human resources functions 
other significant costs include professional fees for legal  auditing  market research and other consulting services  as well as 
table of contents premiums for insurance  other expenses a result of being publicly traded  and depreciation and facility expenses 
in  we expect our general and administrative expense to remain relatively consistent with the level we incurred in interest and other income expense  net 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on capital leases and notes payable 
other income and expense has historically consisted of the proceeds from the sale of excess raw materials and the gain or loss on the disposal of equipment 
in  we expect our net interest and other income to decrease substantially as interest rates have decreased and our balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments is expected to decline 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our current financial condition and historical results of operations are based on our audited financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the selection and application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are important in understanding our financial statements and operating results 
historically our estimates for our critical accounting polices have been not been materially inaccurate 
use of estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the selection and application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current economic and industry conditions  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable at the time  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities 
actual future results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue under licensing and other collaborative research and development agreements as we perform services or meet contractual obligations 
accordingly  up front  non refundable license fees under agreements in which we have an ongoing research and development commitment are amortized  on a straight line basis  over the term of our ongoing obligations under the agreement 
revenues received for ongoing research and development activities under collaborative arrangements are recognized as the research and development activities are performed pursuant to the terms of the related agreements 
in the event we receive milestone payments in the future  we will recognize such payments when all of the terms of such milestone are achieved 
accrued expenses 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to estimate expenses that we believe have been incurred  but for which we have not yet received invoices from our vendors 
this process involves identifying services and activities that have been performed by third party vendors on our behalf and estimating the level to which they have been performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date 
examples of significant expenses for which we generally accrue based on estimates include fees for services  such as those provided by certain clinical research and data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with the conduct of our clinical trials  certain research organizations that perform preclinical studies  and fees owed to certain contract manufacturers in conjunction with the formulation or manufacture of materials for our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
in order to estimate costs incurred to date  but have not been invoiced  we analyze the progress and related activities  the terms of the underlying contract or agreement  any invoices received and the budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability for these related costs 
we make these estimates based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
share based compensation

r  share based payment  sfas no 
r on january  we use the black scholes method to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees and directors 
our forfeiture rate is based on historical 
table of contents experience as well as anticipated turnover and other qualitative factors  which may change over time 
there may be adjustments to future periods if actual forfeitures differ from current estimates 
our awards are issued with graded vesting 
the compensation cost for these graded vesting awards is recognized on the straight line method 
please refer to note to our financial statements for further information on share based compensation 
lease accounting 
in may  we began a non cancelable ten year agreement to lease  square foot research and office facility 
in january  we took possession of and controlled the physical use of the property and occupied the facility in may we have the option to extend the term of the lease for two successive additional periods of five years each by giving prior written notice 
a portion of the leasehold improvements at the research and office facility were capitalized as leasehold improvements paid by the lessor pursuant to the lease agreement 
the leasehold improvement assets are being amortized over the economic life and the liability is being amortized over life of lease  which is ten years 
the amortization is recorded as a discount to rent expense for the liability as the amortization expense for leasehold improvements for the asset 
the balances of the capitalized lessor paid leasehold improvements are classified in the balance sheet as leasehold improvements for the asset and other liabilities for the liability  respectively 
in addition  we took possession  or control of  the physical use of the facility in january  at which time the work was initiated on the leasehold improvements 
the leasehold improvements were completed in may this four month gap constituted a rent holiday 
as such  we accrued rent for that time period 
this accrued rent is being amortized as a discount to rent over the remaining year life of the lease 
further  we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the life of the lease since the minimum rent payments escalate over the lease term 
the difference between cash rent payments and rent expense is recorded as deferred rent 
the balance of these rent liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as other liabilities 
in  we subleased  square feet of our office facility under a sublease 
the initial term on the sublease shall terminate on december  with an option by the subtenant to extend the term until april in connection with this sublease agreement  we accrued a loss on rent  reflecting the present value net difference in the rent it expects to receive under the sublease and the estimated cost it would incur on the subleased space over the life of the sublease 
we recognize the sublease rental income on a straight line basis over the life of the sublease

liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity since our inception in may through december   we have funded our operations primarily with million in gross proceeds raised from a series of five private equity financings  our ipo in june  and two pipe financings  or private placement of public equity financings 
from inception through december   we have also borrowed a total of million under various notes payable  a credit facility with a commercial bank and capital leases  and have received approximately million in license fees  collaborative research payments and grants  of which million and million were recorded as deferred revenue as of december  and december   respectively 
at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million and we held no investments with an average maturity greater than months 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are generally held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  consisting of united states treasury securities  united states government agency securities  high grade corporate bonds  commercial paper  and money market accounts that have an average maturity date of less than months 
cash flows for the year ended december   cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments decreased by million  from million to million 
this decrease resulted primarily from cash used for operating activities  an arbitration settlement related to a production and supply agreement  purchase of capital equipment  and the repayment of capital lease obligations and notes payable 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  which reflects our net million loss for the period plus net cash used from changes in operating accounts of million  offset by non cash charges of million included in our net loss 
our net loss was largely the result of the cost of funding our clinical 
table of contents trials  preclinical studies and other research and development activities  and general and administrative expenses  offset in part by the amortization of deferred revenue from our license and collaboration agreements and net interest income 
the million net cash used by the net changes in operating accounts consisted of million in decreased accounts payable and accrued liabilities  which was largely due to the payments of million on an arbitration settlement award related to a production and supply agreement and a million reduction of accrued expense with the settlement of such arbitration as well as decreases in various other accruals  increase in accounts receivable and million increase in deferred revenue  offset in part by million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets 
we received approximately million of cash from investing activities during  which primarily consisted of net proceeds from short term investments of million and million in proceeds from sale of equipment  offset in part by million in cash paid for capital expenditures and million in exit costs related to the fermavir acquisition in we used net cash of million from financing activities during  which consisted of million in scheduled payments on our capital leases and promissory notes  million for repurchase of our common stock  offset in part by million in proceeds from a capital lease relating to the financing of equipment 
funding requirements our future funding requirements are difficult to determine and will depend on a number of factors  including any changes in our strategy in the future  our development plans  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the variability  timing and costs associated with conducting preclinical studies  the cost of manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials for our product candidates  the variability  timing and costs associated with conducting clinical trials  the rate of enrollment in such clinical trials and the results of these clinical trials  the cost to obtain and the timing of regulatory approvals required to advance the development of our programs or product candidates  the number of product candidates we may advance into clinical development  future payments we may receive or make under existing or future license or collaboration agreements if any  whether we obtain additional preclinical or clinical stage product candidates or programs through future in licensing or acquisition  the cost to maintain a corporate infrastructure to support being a publicly traded company  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  and enforcing patent and other intellectual property claims 
based on our current strategy and operating plan  and considering the potential costs associated with advancing the development of our existing pipeline on our planned timelines  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million as of december   including proceeds from anticipated existing licensing agreements and collaborations  will enable us to operate for a period of at least months 
our estimate assumes that we advance fv into a phase ii proof of concept trial in and file an ind for a lead hcv nucleoside polymerase clinical candidate in the first half of this estimate does not include any costs for the further development of the mscramm platform  including aurexis  or our hiv integrase inhibitor program or any other significant transaction or change in our strategy or development plans 

table of contents we currently do not have any commitments for future funding  nor do we anticipate that we will generate significant revenue from the sale of any products in the foreseeable future 
therefore  in order to meet our anticipated liquidity needs beyond months to continue the development of our product candidates  or possibly sooner in the event we enter into other transactions or change our strategy or development plans  we may need to secure additional capital 
we would expect to do so primarily through the sale of additional common stock or other equity securities  as well as through proceeds from licensing agreements  strategic collaborations  forms of debt financing  or any other financing vehicle 
funds from these sources may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  and our failure to raise such funds could have a material adverse impact on our future business strategy  plans  financial condition and results of operations 
if adequate funds are not available to us in the future  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs  delay or curtail our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
if additional capital is not available to us  we may need to obtain funds through license agreements  collaborative or partner arrangements pursuant to which we will likely relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise choose to develop or commercialize independently  or be forced to enter into such arrangements earlier than we would prefer  which would likely result in less favorable transaction terms 
additional equity financings may be dilutive to holders of our common stock  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant payment obligations and restrictive covenants that restrict how we operate our business
