business overview overview we are the trusted provider of internet infrastructure services for the networked world 
we offer a comprehensive spectrum of products and services that help a growing number of organizations and individuals to communicate and conduct commerce with confidence 
as of december   our business consisted of two reportable segments internet infrastructure and identity services is  which consists of naming services  secure socket layer ssl certificate services  identity and authentication services ias  and verisign japan  and other services  which represents continuing operations of non core businesses and legacy products and services from divested businesses 
prior to  our business consisted of the following two reportable segments internet services group isg and the communication services group csg 
as a result of a comprehensive review of our business strategy  we changed our reportable segments in comparative segment revenues and related financial information for   and are presented in note  segment information  description of segments  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
we have reclassified prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation 
we have operations inside as well as outside the us for a geographic breakdown of revenues and changes in revenues  see note  segment information  geographic revenues  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
the naming services business is the authoritative directory provider of all 
com  
net  
cc  
tv  
name and 
jobs domain names 
the ssl certificate services business enables enterprises and internet merchants to implement and operate secure networks and websites that utilize ssl protocol 
these services provide customers the means to authenticate themselves to their end users and website visitors and to encrypt communications between client browsers and web servers 
the ias business includes identity protection services  fraud detection services  managed public key infrastructure pki services  and unified authentication services 
these services are intended to help enterprises secure intranets  extranets and other applications and devices  and provide authentication credentials 
verisign japan is a majority owned subsidiary and its operations primarily consist of ssl certificate services and ias 
the other services segment consists of the continuing operations of our non core pre pay billing and payment services pre pay business as well as legacy products and services from divested businesses 
we are in the process of winding down the operations of the pre pay business 
in other services  the legacy products and services from divested businesses primarily include the following jamba  
table of contents which provided mobile entertainment to consumers  the rds business  which offered point of sale data information for retail  pharmaceutical and consumer goods customers  and the cdn business  which offered broadband content services that enable the delivery of high quality video and other rich media securely and efficiently at a very large scale 
during the fourth quarter of  we announced a change to our business strategy to allow management to focus its attention on our core competencies and to make additional resources available to invest in our core businesses 
the strategy calls for a divestiture or winding down of all the business lines in our former csg segment and all business lines in our former isg segment except for our core businesses 
the business lines that we expect to divest  including those that have been sold since the fourth quarter of  accounted for approximately of our overall revenues in fiscal these businesses are classified as disposal groups held for sale as of december   and their results of operations have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the continued execution of our divestiture plan is subject to the availability of financing  identification of buyers  and general market conditions  including further developments in the current global economic condition and potential continued deterioration of the credit markets 
while we are executing our divestiture plan  we will experience additional risks  including  but not limited to the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees  difficulties separating operations  services  products and personnel  the potential damage to relationships with our existing customers  and the delay in completion of transition services 
for example  our divestiture plan requires a substantial amount of management  administrative and operational resources 
once our divestiture plan is completed  the scale and scope of our operations will decrease in absolute terms  which we expect will allow our remaining core businesses to benefit from a more efficient and streamlined operational structure 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits we expect from the divestiture of our non core businesses and there is no guarantee that the planned divestitures will occur or will not be significantly delayed  all of which may result in future variability in our results of operations 
by divesting our non core businesses  additional resources should be available to invest in our core services that will remain naming services  ssl certificate services and ias 
in the first quarter of  we announced a realignment of our three core services into two business units to include the following naming services and authentication services  which would include both ssl certificate services and ias 
our core services our core services consist of our naming services  ssl certificate services and ias 
naming services as of december   we had approximately million domain names registered under the 
com and 
net registries  which are our principal registries 
the number of domain names registered is largely driven by internet usage and broadband penetration rates 
although growth in absolute number of registrations remains greatest in mature markets such as the us and western europe  growth on an annual percentage basis is expected to be greatest in markets outside of the us and europe where internet penetration has demonstrated the greatest potential for growth 
we are largely insulated from the risk posed by fluctuations in exchange rates due to the fact that all revenues paid to us for 
com and 
net registrations are in us dollars 
ssl certificate services as of december   we had an installed base of ssl certificates of approximately million 
we currently offer the following ssl certificate services verisign  geotrust  and thawte branded certificates 
the major factors impacting the growth and performance of our ssl certificate services business are the penetration and adoption of the internet  especially through broadband services  the spread of e commerce  the utilization of electronic means for executing financial transactions such as credit card payments  and the extent to which advertising through search engines encourages consumers to engage in e commerce 
as a result of the 
table of contents growing impact of the internet on global commercial transactions  we expect continued revenue growth in our business  primarily in markets outside of the us where e commerce has the largest growth potential 
ias as with our ssl certificate services  the major factors impacting the growth and performance of our ias are the penetration and adoption of the internet  especially through broadband services  the spread of e commerce  the utilization of electronic means for executing financial transactions such as credit card payments  and the extent to which advertising through search engines encourages consumers to engage in e commerce

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates those estimates 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies have the most significant impact on our judgment and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles 
revenue recognition requirements are complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates related to both the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
our assumptions and judgments regarding products and services could differ from actual events 
as our naming services  ssl certificate services and ias are provided over time  the associated revenues from these services are generally recognized over the contractual term 
however  certain revenues are recognized over an estimated relationship period determined based on an analysis of historical performance and customer usage 
while the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions  there are certain transactions that contain non standard business terms and conditions 
in addition  we may enter into certain revenue transactions that involve multiple element arrangements arrangements with more than one deliverable 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including whether an arrangement exists  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple elements  when to recognize revenues on the deliverables  and whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured  which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired 
fair value determination of acquired net assets  especially intangible assets  requires us to make significant estimates  assumptions and judgment 
these estimates are based upon a number of factors  including historical experience  market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired company 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include  but are not limited to  historical and projected customer retention rates  anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customer and product base and the expected use of the acquired assets 
these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually or between annual tests in the presence of impairment indicators such as a a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  b an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  c unanticipated competition  d loss of key personnel  e a more likely than not expectation of sale or disposal of a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof  f testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  or g recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit 
judgment is required in determining the existence of these factors and its effect on any impairment determination 
the fair value of our reporting units is determined considering the income  the market or the transaction valuation approaches or a combination thereof 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life 
under the market approach  the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 
the transaction approach is a valuation technique that estimates the fair value of the reporting unit based on market prices on actual transactions and asking prices for businesses currently available for sale 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of our reporting units for the purposes 
table of contents of our annual or interim analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows  operating trends  discount rates  control premiums  and other variables of these businesses 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over their estimated remaining useful lives 
we also consider our market capitalization on the date we perform the analysis 
our other long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment and purchased intangible assets 
we review other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business  difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset 
recoverability of other long lived assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows of the group containing the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
valuation of assets held for sale disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and are not depreciated or amortized 
classification of our disposal groups as held for sale occurs when sufficient authority to sell the disposal group has been obtained  the disposal group is available for immediate sale  an active program to sell the disposal group has been initiated and its sale is probable within one year 
if at any time these criteria are no longer met  the disposal group would be reclassified as held and used 
we evaluate the held for sale classification and the fair value of such disposal groups at each reporting period 
the fair value of assets held for sale is determined considering active bids from potential buyers and also using the income  the market or the transaction valuation approaches or a combination thereof 
the fair value analysis using the income  market and transaction approach for assets held for sale is similar to the fair value analysis of reporting units for goodwill impairment described above and requires significant judgment 
restructuring charges we record restructuring charges related to excess facilities and one time severance costs at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
severance costs associated with our standard restructuring plans are recorded once the costs are determined to be both probable and estimable 
excess facilities restructuring charges take into account the fair value of the future lease obligations of the abandoned space  including the potential for sublease income 
estimating the amount of sublease income requires management to make estimates for the space that will be rented  the rate per square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of each property 
these estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located  such as the supply of office space and prevailing lease rates 
changing market conditions by location and considerable work with third party leasing companies require us to periodically review each lease and change our estimates on a prospective basis  as necessary 
fair value of financial instruments our convertible debentures have contingent interest payments that are considered to be an embedded derivative which is marked to market at the end of each reporting period 
we utilize a valuation model based on simulations of stock prices  interest rates  credit ratings and bond prices to estimate the value of the embedded derivative 
the inputs to the model include risk adjusted interest rates  volatility and average yield curve observations and stock price 
several significant inputs to the model are not observable and require management judgment 

table of contents stock based compensation we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares which contain a service and or performance condition 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on observed and expected time to post vesting exercise and or cancellations 
expected volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the expected life of the options and the mean historical implied volatility from traded options 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we use the monte carlo simulation option pricing model to determine the fair value of market based awards 
the monte carlo simulation option pricing model takes into account the same input assumptions as the black scholes model  however  it also further incorporates into the fair value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied 
if factors change and as a result we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  the stock based compensation expense we record for such future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income loss  net income loss and net income loss per share 
income taxes accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations 
such judgments include  but are not limited to  the likelihood we would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards  domestic and or foreign tax credit carryforwards  the adequacy of valuation allowances  and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries 
to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the extent of our operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
the final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors  including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from us federal  state  and international tax audits effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin is an interpretation of sfas no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  and provides for the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions

net domain name registrations up to each year during the remaining three years of our agreement with icann through september  during  the growth in the number of domain names registered was primarily driven by continued internet growth and adoption  though we have seen some signs of slowing growth in domain name registrations for customers engaged in the business of on line advertising 
we expect that new name registrations and renewals from customers engaged in the business of participating in on line advertising will continue to weaken through primarily due to a decrease in earnings per click for those domain name holders 
we expect that on line advertising domain names will become a smaller part of our business  these names comprise approximately of our active domain names zone ending in

ssl certificate services revenues in our ssl certificate services business are derived from licensing and service fees charged to our customers for the issuance of ssl certificates that authenticate their identity to the third parties with whom they carry out secured transactions 
revenues in the ssl certificate services business are related to fees charged per certificate  which are based upon a number of factors  including i the brand name under which the certificate is issued  which determines the level of encryption and rigor of authentication  ii the number of 
table of contents servers authenticated  and iii the duration of the certification 
we generally issue ssl certificates for one  two and three years  however  the majority of our customers tend to commit to shorter certifications 
we have historically experienced healthy renewal rates  and have not increased prices for our ssl certificates during and during  our installed base of ssl certificates from our geotrust and thawte brands increased at a higher rate than our higher priced verisign brand and as a result of this shift to lower priced brands  our average unit revenue decreased compared to prior periods 
we expect that the number of our ssl certificates issued will continue to increase at a higher rate than the revenues recognized from our ssl certificate services due to the continued shift to lower priced brands 
as we have a market share leadership at the high end of the ssl certificates market  our unit growth rate for the high end is limited by the overall segment growth 
in the mid and low segments  where our market share is not as strong  we expect to see good growth opportunities for market share gains as these markets are growing faster than the high end market 
our ev ssl certificate sales  while still a small portion of our ssl certificate services business  continue to increase as we more than doubled our units sold compared to last year 
due to the effect of the economic slowdown  however  ev ssl certificates adoption has slowed as large scale customers delay their orders 
we expect the mainstream adoption of ev ssl certificates will be deferred until we see improvements in the macro economic environment 
the weakening economy is affecting our ssl certificate services business and  while we expect to experience growth  we expect those growth rates to decline in compared to our ssl certificate services revenues increased million in  as compared to  primarily due to a year over year increase in the installed base of ssl certificates

we also charge an annual service fee based upon the number of individual users authorized by the customer to access its network and a customer support fee 
our managed pki service is characterized by lower growth rates than other product lines within the ias business  reflecting the greater maturity of our managed pki service

in summary  our cash flows were as follows year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  and other general operating expenses  as well as payments related to taxes and facilities 
compared to cash provided by operations increased primarily due to an increase in revenues in coupled with an increase in cash collections from customers due to an improved collection process implemented in the increase in cash receipts was partially offset by payments for interest on our convertible debentures  and a decrease in interest income received due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates in compared to cash provided by operations decreased marginally primarily due to a decrease in cash received from customers resulting from the divestiture of our majority interest in jamba  coupled with the timing of receipts from customers 
the decrease in cash receipts was partially offset by a decrease in cash 
table of contents payments to suppliers and employees primarily resulting from lower headcount  an increase in cash received for interest income due to higher average cash balances in and a decrease in cash payments for income taxes due to lower pre tax income in net cash provided by used in investing activities the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to business combinations  divestiture of businesses  timing of purchases  maturities and sales of investments  purchases of property and equipment  investments in unconsolidated entities and long term note receivable 
compared to net cash provided by investing activities decreased primarily due to the reclassification of the money market funds held by the reserve classified as cash equivalents to prepaid expenses and other current assets in  offset by an increase in proceeds received in due to the divestiture of businesses  the sale of our investments in unconsolidated entities  the sale of property and equipment related to part of our mountain view facilities and the termination of the trust established for our director s and officer s liability self insurance coverage 
the decrease was also due to lower cash proceeds from maturities and sales of investments and cash spent on our acquisition of gnr  partially offset by lower cash spent on purchases of property and equipment 
compared to net cash provided by investing activities increased primarily due to proceeds received upon the divestiture of our majority ownership interest in jamba and certain other businesses  and a decrease in cash spent on business combinations and purchases of investments  partially offset by a decrease in cash received from maturities and sales of investments 
net cash used in provided by financing activities the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments under debt obligations  as well as stock repurchase and stock option exercise activities 
compared to net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to stock repurchases in without corresponding proceeds from financing activities  as compared to when stock repurchases were primarily funded by proceeds received from the issuance of the convertible debentures 
the remaining increase in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to an increase in stock repurchases in and a decrease in proceeds received from issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plans 
compared to net cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to proceeds received from issuance of the convertible debentures and an increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock upon stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases  partially offset by an increase in cash spent for stock repurchase activities and repayment of short term debt under the facility 
we believe existing cash and cash equivalents  together with funds generated from operations and the availability of financing  if necessary  from our facility should be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure requirements and to service our debt for the next months 
our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to expansion of our businesses  related acquisitions  and share repurchases 
we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during  and 
table of contents property and equipment expenditures our planned property and equipment expenditures for are anticipated to be approximately million and will primarily be focused on productivity  cost improvement and market development initiatives for our is business 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant non cancelable contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period total thereafter in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations icann agreement junior subordinated convertible debentures principal and interest total as of december   we had commitments under non cancelable operating leases for our facilities for various terms through see note  commitments and contingencies  leases  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k

our significant purchase obligations primarily consist of firm commitments with telecommunication carriers and other service providers 
we do not have any significant purchase obligations beyond in june  we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser of our mountain view property 
under the terms of the lease agreement  we will lease the property for an initial term of months  which will expire on december   with an option to extend the lease for five years from the date of initial term expiration 
our lease obligations under the term will be approximately million and million in and  respectively 
in  we issued billion principal amount of convertible debentures due we will pay cash interest semiannually to the holders of the convertible debentures on february and august of each year until maturity 
interest paid for the convertible debentures for the year ended december   was approximately million

as of december   we have met the criteria and as a result our contractual payments will increase to the amounts as listed in the table above for the respective future periods 
we provide for uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits accordingly 
due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  million of liabilities under fin have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the latter half of  there was a major disruption in the global credit markets due to the rising concerns about possible financial institution defaults  the bankruptcy filing of lehman brothers holdings inc lehman and the potential for a deep economic recession 
following these disruptions  certain money market funds managed by the reserve made various announcements that their underlying portfolios had experienced a loss of principal  the redemption rights of all holders were suspended indefinitely and the funds would be liquidated 
the loss of principal was primarily related to the underlying securities of lehman in the funds 
at the time of the redemption suspension  we had million invested in the primary fund and the international fund which we had previously classified as cash and cash equivalents and is now classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets 
due to the lack of an active market for most corporate and bank debt securities  we assessed the fair value of the underlying securities within the primary fund and the international fund based on a review of current investment ratings of the underlying securities within the money market funds coupled with an evaluation of the expected maturity value and the current performance of the securities within the funds in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest 
we based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of our investments in the primary fund and the international fund 
during the third quarter of  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of million in other loss income  net  related to the underlying securities of lehman held in the primary fund and the international fund and the related liquidity risk in the investment 
the credit and capital markets deteriorated significantly in and may continue to deteriorate into if these markets deteriorate further  or if we are allocated a portion of the legal and or administrative costs incurred by the primary fund and or the international fund during their liquidation process  we may incur additional impairments  which could negatively affect its financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
the timing of additional distributions from these money market funds are currently subject to the discretion of the funds boards of directors  possible oversight by the sec and resolution of certain pending and possible future lawsuits against the reserve 
during the fourth quarter of  we received a distribution of million from the primary fund 
as of december   we had million in the primary fund and the international fund 
on january   we received million from the reserve s international fund and on february  we received million from the reserve s primary fund 
the total distributions to date represents approximately and of our total investment in the primary fund and the international fund  respectively 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity we invest our cash primarily in money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not considered to be subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds 
foreign exchange risk management we conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies 
as we continue to expand our international operations we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange rate risks 
our foreign currency risk management program is designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with the monetary and non monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in non functional currencies 
the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses to income resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates 
we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality  prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures  and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments 
we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes  nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates 
the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts and in each case these contracts are limited to a duration of less than months 
as of december   our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations was not significant 
at december   we held forward contracts in notional amounts totaling million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies 
all forward contracts are recorded at fair market value 
a hypothetical uniform strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currency derivatives outstanding would result in a decrease increase in income of approximately million 
however  this would be largely offset by the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated monetary and non monetary assets and liabilities resulting in an insignificant net impact to income 
a hypothetical uniform strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a significant impact to our financial statements 
there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented  due primarily to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous 
as a result  the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise  which may positively or negatively affect income 
market risk management the fair market value of the convertible debentures issued by us and due august  is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of the convertible debentures will also increase as the market price of our stock increases and decrease as the market price falls 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the convertible debentures but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
as of december   the fair value of the convertible debentures was approximately million  based on quoted market prices 
the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative on convertible debentures is also subject to interest rate risk and market risk 
generally  the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative will change due to changes in interest rates as well as due to changes in the fair market value of the convertible debentures
