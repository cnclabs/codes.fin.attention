the integration segment provides cradle to grave services for a wide variety of security  communications and control systems 
the company specializes in turn key systems that integrate many different technologies 
systems are customized to meet the specific needs of its customers 
through the specialty segment we provide emergency preparedness programs  and specialized radio frequency communication equipment and integration

customers are primarily medium and large businesses and governmental agencies 
the company derives a majority of its revenues from project installations and  to a smaller extent  maintenance service revenue 
our vision and strategy our vision is to maintain our leadership position in security technology 
we intend to do this in part by providing advice on product selection and system design  examining and thoroughly testing each security product as it would be set up for use in our customers facilities  and using only systems and components that are reliable and efficient to use 
in addition to growing the business organically  we have been actively pursuing the strategic acquisition of synergistic integrators and specialty products and service companies to further fuel steady growth 
consistent with our expansion strategy  we acquired seven companies since may of  which include the two acquisitions made in october see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
to finance our acquisitions  we have used a combination of internally generated cash  the sale of company common stock and bank debt 
we currently have a million credit facility with td banknorth  which includes a million term loan of which  was outstanding at december  as part of our credit facility we also have an million revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility were  at december  it is our expectation and intent to use cash and to incur additional debt as appropriate to finance future working capital and acquisitions 
additionally  to fund future acquisitions we would consider the issuance of subordinated debt  or the sale of equity securities  or the sale of existing company assets 
trends we anticipate that the overall average operating margins for our business to be approximately for  as compared to operating margins of  essentially breakeven  and for years  and  respectively 
there are several factors impacting operating margins  including levels of competition for a particular project and the size of the project 
as a significant amount of our costs are relatively fixed  such as labor costs  increases or decreases in revenues can have a significant impact on operating margins 
the company continually monitors costs and pursues cost control measures and sales initiatives to improve operating margins 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued fsp no 
determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp 
fsp clarifies the application of sfas in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
fsp was effective for the company on september  for all financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis or at least annually 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
the statement is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent hierarchy for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with gaap 
prior to the issuance of sfas no 
 gaap hierarchy was defined in the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement on auditing standards sas no 
the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
unlike sas no 
 sfas no 
is directed to the entity rather than the auditor 
statement no 
is effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board auditing amendments to au section the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  sfas no 
is not expected to have any material impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity

fair value measurements 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  the company has adopted the provisions of sfas no 
with respect to its financial assets and liabilities only 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas no 
as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas no 
must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management uses its best judgment in valuing these estimates and may  as warranted  solicit external professional advice 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from a project in either the integration or specialty segments are recognized on the percentage of completion method  whereby revenue and the related gross profit are determined based upon the actual costs incurred to date for the project to the total estimated project costs at completion 
project costs generally include all material and shipping costs  the company s direct labor  subcontractor costs and an allocation of indirect costs related to the direct labor 
changes in the project scope  site conditions  staff performance and delays or problems with the equipment used on the project can result in increased costs that may not be billable or accepted by the customer and results in a loss or lower profit than was originally anticipated at the time of the proposal 
estimates for the costs to complete the project are continuously updated by management during the performance of the project 
provisions for changes in estimated costs and losses  if any  on uncompleted projects are made in the period in which such changes are determined 
in general  we determine a project to be substantially completed after the scope of work is completed  which includes installing the equipment as required in the contract 
system is functional and has been tested 
training has been provided 
the majority of the company s projects are completed within a year 
revenue from product sales are recognized when title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
service contracts  which are generally separate and distinct agreements from project agreements  are billed either monthly or quarterly on the last day of the month covered by the contract 
accordingly  revenue from service contracts are recognized ratably over the length of the agreement 
in  and  the company did not bundle any significant service contracts with our systems installation work 
trade receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are stated at net realizable value 
this value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts 
the allowance is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon historical experience with the customer  the aging of the past due amounts and the relationship with and economic status of our customers 
the evaluation is based upon estimates taking into account the facts and circumstances at the time of the evaluation 
actual uncollectible accounts could exceed our estimates and changes to its estimates will be accounted for in the period of change 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
our trade receivables are not collateralized 
inventory valuation inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost has been determined using the first in  first out method 
inventory quantities on hand are regularly reviewed  and where necessary  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories are recorded 
warranty the company offers warranties on all products  including parts and labor that range from one year to three years depending upon the type of product concerned 
for products made by others  the company passes along the manufacturer s warranty to the end user 
intangible assets the company s intangible assets include goodwill and other intangibles that consist of the fair value of acquired customer lists  service contracts acquired  trade names  and covenants not to compete 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired at the date of acquisition 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial and accounting standards sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with that statement  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but are tested at least annually for impairment 
prior to january   the company had not recorded goodwill or other intangible assets of indefinite lives 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives  consisting primarily of acquired customer lists  service contracts and covenants not to compete are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to fifteen years and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
if the intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  the intangible asset will be amortized over the remaining useful life 
if the asset being amortized is determined to have an indefinite useful life  the asset will be tested for impairment 
the impairment test will consist of measuring its fair value with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the intangible assets exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for an amount equal to the excess and the adjusted carrying amount is recognized as its new accounting basis 
the company s goodwill impairment test is based on a two part procedure consistent with the requirements of sfas the first test consists of determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  a second test is performed 
in step two  the implied fair value of the goodwill which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the net assets is compared to the carrying value of the goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized for any excess value of goodwill over the implied value 
we determined the reporting unit by analyzing geographic regions  as management evaluates the company s performance in this manner 
we have identified five separate and distinct operating units for the testing requirements of sfas  and evaluate each reporting unit for impairment 
income taxes deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  analysis of consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december  change revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges operating profit interest income other income expense interest expense income loss before tax expense provision for income taxes net income loss revenue revenue for the year ended december  was  representing an increase of  or  as compared to revenue of  for the year ended december  arizona operations continued to show significant revenue improvement as revenues from its top three customers showed year over year increases 
improved revenues from our colorado and virginia operations also contributed to the higher revenues for the year ended december   compared to the same period in the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue from our california banking operations  as well as from our airorlite subsidiary 
while up significantly from preceding years  new jersey new york s revenues were flat in compared to a significant portion of the revenues in both years for new jersey new york resulted from work completed for several large public agencies in the new york metropolitan area 
in february  the company entered into a subcontractor agreement with global security engineering solutions  a division of l services  inc l pursuant to which l would issue task orders under its indefinite quantity firm fixed price contract with the us marine corp systems command to deliver a tactical video capture system tvcs 
tvcs is used for real time visualization and situational awareness while marine units are conducting military operations in urban terrain training exercises 
the performance period of the contract is three years 
in  the revenue recognized under this contract represented million and there were outstanding task orders included in our backlog of approximately million at december  cost of revenue cost of revenue for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  the gross margin as a percent of revenues for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december   mainly resulting from stronger margins in our new jersey new york and virginia operations 
in the earlier months of  new jersey new york experienced a margin decline as the result of cost overruns on a number of installations  which contributed to the improvement for the year ended december  versus in addition  during new jersey new york experienced higher margins on several of the large public agency jobs in the new york metropolitan area due to efficient project management  which also contributed to this year over year comparison 
in addition to the gross margin as a percent of revenue improvement  the significantly higher revenues from our new jersey new york and arizona operations contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended december  gross profit in also benefited from the commencement of work on the l contract discussed above 
partially offsetting the improved margins were significant losses incurred in the first quarter of in our airorlite subsidiary in order to complete work on certain open contracts 
also contributing to the improved margins in the first year of was an overall shift to higher margin jobs  and improved labor utilization 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of or  was mainly attributable to higher vehicle expense due to increased fuel costs during  higher stock option expense and a net increase in bad debt expense for the current year period  partially offset by improved labor utilization  lower professional fees  and lower depreciation and amortization of intangibles expense 
interest income interest income for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to higher cash balances during the twelve month period ended december  versus the same period in the prior year 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  although the average outstanding debt balance was only  higher in the twelve month period ended december  versus that in the year ended december   the average prime rate of interest paid was basis points lower in the period than it was in tax expense the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  based upon income before tax expense of  the tax rate is a result of the company operating in multiple states and jurisdictions with higher tax rates  combined with the impact of being unable to claim a state tax benefit on the airorlite subsidiary losses 
tax expense for the year ended december  was  this provision is driven primarily by profitability in states with higher income tax rates 
net income loss as a result of the above noted factors our net income was  for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  this resulted in diluted earnings per share of on weighted average diluted common shares outstanding of  for the year ended december   as compared to diluted loss per share of on weighted average diluted common shares outstanding of  for the year ended december  comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  analysis of consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december  change revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses selling  general administrative expenses goodwill intangible asset impairment charges operating profit loss interest income other expense interest expense loss before tax expense tax expense benefit net loss revenue revenue for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  this represents an increase of over the prior year 
cis security systems corp 
cis virginia and maryland operations acquired in october accounted for  of the increase in revenues 
new jersey s revenues increased significantly as a result of the contracts awarded by large public agencies in the new york metropolitan area at the end of and early for the year ended december   the company experienced continued revenue improvement from our arizona division  as well as improvements in our colorado  texas and california divisions 
revenues from governmental agencies represented and of total revenues  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of revenue cost of revenue for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  the gross profit margin for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  the decline in the gross profit margin was driven principally from the california and new jersey operations 
california s margin decline was the result of cost overruns on a number of projects that were quoted late in and early the decline in new jersey in the first quarter of was the result of cost overruns on a number of installations 
in addition  as discussed above in revenue  several large projects were booked in new jersey at the end of and early in these projects carry gross profit margins that are below the company s historical average 
therefore  while gross margin percentages declined in new jersey for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year  because of the significant increase in revenue from these larger projects  gross profit dollars actually increased by year over year 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increased costs associated with the cis acquisition in our fourth quarter  as well as higher corporate costs  due mainly to organizational changes  and costs incurred in addressing the internal control weaknesses identified in item a of the annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   as well as costs incurred in preparation for sarbanes oxley implementation  were generally offset by lower bad debt expense and improved labor utilization 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges based upon our goodwill evaluation under the requirements of sfas  the company took a charge to operations of  or 
per diluted share associated with goodwill impairment associated with our california banking vertical market for the year ended december  for the year ended december  the company recorded a  impairment charge for the write down of a trade name 
interest income interest income for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  average outstanding debt balance was considerably higher in the twelve month period ended december  versus for the year ended december   accounting for the higher interest expense in tax expense tax expense for the year ended december  was  this provision is driven primarily by profitability in states with higher income tax rates 
for the year ended december   principally as a result of the loss before tax incurred by the company  there was an overall tax benefit of  this benefit was partially offset by state income taxes for those jurisdictions that were profitable during the period 
the write off of the goodwill discussed above is a permanent difference under fasb  accounting for income taxes 
accordingly  there was no tax benefit taken for this write off 
net loss as a result of the above noted factors our net loss was  for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  this resulted in diluted loss per share of on weighted average common shares outstanding of  for the year ended december   as compared to diluted loss per share of on weighted average common shares outstanding of  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  our minimal cash balance at december  is due to minimizing the cash balances in our operating accounts by managing it with our revolving credit facility 
our net current assets were  at december  versus  at december  total debt at december  was  compared to the december  balance of  cash used in operating activities was  during the year ended december  the most significant use of cash resulted from a net increase in accounts receivable of  and cost in excess of billings and estimated profits of  and a decrease in accounts payable of  this was partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses of  and an increase in billings in excess of costs and estimated profits of  cash used in investing activities was  the most significant expenditures were for vehicle purchases and earn out payments related to the cis acquisition 
cash from financing activities provided  representing  in net proceeds from the revolving bank line  plus proceeds from stock option exercises of  and a net recovery from stockholder of  partially offset by term loan and capital lease payments 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility at december  were  the company is required to maintain certain financial and reporting covenants and restrictions on dividend payments under the terms of the loan agreement with tb bank  na see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
backlog and bookings booked orders increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the company s backlog as of december  was  and was  at december  the primary factor in the decline in the backlog is attributable to the work completed on several large public agency jobs in new jersey new york in  partially offset by the bookings related to the l contract 
booked orders increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the corresponding period of dividends we have not declared cash dividends on our common equity 
the payment of dividends is prohibited under the existing credit agreement with td bank  n 
a 
we may  in the future  declare dividends under certain circumstances 
seasonality revenues generated by our services have typically been seasonal in nature and there could be periods of fluctuations in revenue volume due to the timing of project installations or factors that are beyond the company s control  such as weather and construction delays 
inflation our revenues generally have kept pace with inflation 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
aggregate contractual obligations as of december   the company s contractual obligations  including payments due by period  are as follows payment due by period thereafter total long term debt obligations interest obligation on long term debt capital lease obligations short term debt total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have one revolving loan for which the interest rate on outstanding borrowings is variable and is based upon the prime rate of interest
