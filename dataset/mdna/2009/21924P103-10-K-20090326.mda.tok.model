item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements due to important factors including  but not limited to  those set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring  developing and commercializing significant products primarily for the respiratory market 
our commercial strategy is to in license or acquire rights to non promoted or underperforming  patent protected  branded pharmaceutical products  or late stage product candidates  and then maximize their potential value and competitive position by promoting the products using our sales and marketing capabilities and applying various life cycle management techniques to extend the period we can sell the product and related derivative products 
we currently market our products only in the united states 
on october   critical therapeutics and cornerstone biopharma completed their previously announced merger 
cornerstone biopharma s reasons for the merger included  among other things  the opportunity to expand cornerstone biopharma s respiratory product portfolio  the potential for enhanced future growth and value and the ability to access additional capital 
following the closing of the merger  former cornerstone biopharma stockholders owned approximately  and former critical therapeutics stockholders owned approximately  of our common stock  after giving effect to shares issuable pursuant to outstanding options and warrants held by cornerstone biopharma s stockholders immediately prior to the effective time of the merger  but without giving effect to any shares issuable pursuant to options and warrants held by critical therapeutics stockholders immediately prior to the effective time of the merger 
because former cornerstone biopharma stockholders owned  immediately following the merger  approximately of the combined company on a fully diluted basis and as a result of certain other factors  cornerstone biopharma was deemed to be the acquiring company for accounting purposes and the transaction was treated as a reverse acquisition in accordance with gaap 
accordingly  for all purposes  our financial statements for periods prior to the merger reflect the historical results of cornerstone biopharma  and not critical therapeutics  and our financial statements for all subsequent periods reflect the results of the combined company 
in addition  unless specifically noted otherwise  discussions of our financial results throughout this document do not include the historical financial results of critical therapeutics including sales of zyflo cr and zyflo prior to the completion of the merger 
key marketed products we currently promote spectracef  zyflo cr and the allerx dose pack family of products

under the dey agreement  we pay dey a portion of quarterly net sales of zyflo cr  after third party royalties  in excess of million 
spectracef 
spectracef is a third generation cephalosporin with the api cefditoren pivoxil that we are marketing in mg and mg tablet formulations

in october  we acquired from meiji the exclusive us rights to manufacture and sell spectracef mg and additional cefditoren pivoxil products and to use the spectracef trademark from meiji pursuant to a license and supply agreement  as amended and supplemented 
in exchange for these exclusive us rights  we agreed to pay meiji a million non refundable license fee in installments over five years and quarterly royalties based on the net sales of the cefditoren pivoxil products covered by the agreement 
we paid  of the license fee in  million in and million in october additional installments of the license fee are due and payable as follows million in october  million in

zyflo cr and zyflo 
we currently market zyflo cr and zyflo  which contain the api zileuton and are indicated for the prevention and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and children years of age and older 
the fda approved our nda for zyflo cr  our twice daily controlled release zileuton product  in may  and we launched zyflo cr in october we began selling zyflo in the united states in october allerx dose pack products 
we currently market three allerx dose pack products  each in day and day regimens allerx dose pack and allerx dose pack  both of which we began marketing in february  allerx dose pack df and allerx dose pack df  which we began marketing in august and july  respectively  and allerx dose pack pe and allerx dose pack pe  which we began marketing in september and october  respectively 
each of these products is administered orally and is indicated for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis 
in february  we acquired all of the rights to the allerx products held by adams in exchange for our rights to the humibid family of products 
we began marketing the first of our allerx day dose pack products in february since adding multiple line extensions as well as a day dose pack for patient convenience  we now market allerx dose pack and allerx dose pack 
we believe that allerx dose pack  allerx dose pack  allerx dose pack pe and allerx dose pack pe are protected under claims in the patent  which we licensed directly from pharmaceutical innovations in august under our license agreement with pharmaceutical innovations  as amended  we pay pharmaceutical innovations royalties based on a percentage of annual net sales of each product  subject to specified minimums 
other products we currently generate revenues from product sales and royalties from the sale of other products that we do not actively promote 
of these  hyomax  balacet  apap and deconsal have generated the most net revenues to date for us 
of our marketed products that we do not promote  only our balacet and apap products are promoted by a third party 
hyomax 
the hyomax line of products consists of generic formulations of four antispasmodic medications containing the api hyoscyamine sulfate  an anticholinergic  which may be prescribed for various gastrointestinal disorders 
aristos launched the first hyomax product  hyomax sl mg tablets  in may  followed by hyomax sr mg tablets and hyomax ft mg chewable melt tablets in june and hyomax dt mg immediate release mg sustained release tablets in july we pay sovereign its costs to manufacture the hyomax products exclusively for us  as well as a royalty based on a share of the net profits realized from the sale of the products 
balacet  apap and apap these products are indicated for the relief of mild to moderate pain 
in july  we licensed from vintage the rights to balacet and apap for an upfront payment of million  a note payable of million and ongoing quarterly royalty payments equal to a percentage of the products net sales 
we paid the note payable in full in february we began marketing balacet in april  but ceased all promotional efforts for this product in january to concentrate our resources on the respiratory market 
in december  we licensed the rights to an authorized generic formulation of balacet from vintage 
in july  we began marketing apap through our aristos subsidiary as a generic formulation of balacet 
table of contents in september  we entered into a supply and marketing agreement with pliva relating to apap under this agreement  which we terminated effective december   pliva sold apap that was supplied to it by vintage and paid us royalties based on the quarterly net sales of apap in april  we entered into a co promotion agreement with atley pharmaceuticals to co promote balacet  and apap  which was added pursuant to an amendment to the co promotion agreement in july under this agreement  we pay atley pharmaceuticals co promotion fees based on a percentage of the net profits from our sales of balacet and apap above a specified baseline based on prescriptions by all prescribers within assigned sales territories 
deconsal 
in july  we acquired all rights related to prescription products marketed under the deconsal brand name from carolina pharmaceuticals ltd  or carolina pharmaceuticals  an entity under common control with us  in exchange for quarterly royalties equal to a percentage of the net sales of deconsal products through december  in january  we launched deconsal ii  an expectorant and nasal decongestant combination tablet for oral administration with the apis guaifenesin and phenylephrine 
in  we launched the deconsal ct tannate chewable tablets and deconsal dm tannate chewable tablets  which contain an antihistamine  a nasal decongestant and  with respect to deconsal dm  an antitussive 
in may  the fda announced that manufacturers must stop making products that contain guaifenesin in a timed release dosage form by august  and stop shipping in interstate commerce by november  as a result  we stopped selling deconsal ii in november product candidates our product development pipeline includes two spectracef line extensions  an anticholinergic and antihistamine combination product candidate  and two extended release antitussive and antihistamine combination product candidates 
the spectracef line extensions include spectracef once daily  a single tablet  once daily dosage of spectracef  for which we commenced a clinical trial in the fourth quarter of and expect to commence additional clinical trials in late  with an snda submission targeted for  and spectracef suspension  an oral  liquid suspension of spectracef  for which we expect to rely on previous clinical trials for use of this product candidate by children with pharyngitis or tonsillitis  conduct clinical trials in for the use of this product candidate by children with acute otitis media and submit an nda in for use of this product candidate by children with acute otitis media  pharyngitis or tonsillitis 
we are developing crtx  an anticholinergic and antihistamine combination product candidate for the treatment of the symptoms of allergic rhinitis 
we are targeting an nda submission for crtx in we are also developing crtx and crtx  antitussive and antihistamine combination product candidates  for which we are targeting regulatory submissions in if approved  we are planning to commercially launch crtx and crtx in late or early history of losses from inception in through  we incurred operating losses  including net losses of  in and million in our net income was million in and  in as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to continue to incur significant development and commercialization expenses as we seek fda approval for spectracef once daily and spectracef suspension  advance the development of our other product candidates  including our anticholinergic and antihistamine combination product candidate  crtx  and our antitussive and antihistamine combination product candidates  crtx and crtx  seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical testing  and expand our sales team and marketing capabilities to prepare for the commercial launch of future products  subject to fda approval 
we also expect to incur additional expenses to add operational  financial and management information systems and personnel  including personnel to support our product development efforts 
accordingly  we will need to increase our 
table of contents revenues to be able to sustain and increase our profitability 
there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
financial operations overview net revenues our net revenues are comprised of net product sales and royalty agreement revenues 
we recognize product sales net of estimated allowances for product returns  estimated rebates in connection with contracts relating to managed care  medicaid and medicare  estimated chargebacks  price adjustments  product vouchers  co pay vouchers  and prompt payment and other discounts 
the primary factors that determine our net product sales are the level of demand for our products  unit sales prices and the amount of sales adjustments that we recognize 
royalty agreement revenues consist of royalties we receive under license agreements with third parties that sell products to which we have rights 
the primary factors that affect royalty agreement revenues are the demand and sales prices for such products and the royalty rates that we receive on the sales of such products by third parties 
from time to time  we implement price increases on our branded products 
our branded and generic products are subject to rebates  chargebacks and other sales allowances that have the effect of decreasing the net revenues that we ultimately realize from product sales 
our generic products may also be subject to substantial price competition from equivalent generic products introduced by other pharmaceutical companies 
such competition may also decrease our net revenues from the sale of our generic products 
cost of product sales our cost of product sales is primarily comprised of the costs of manufacturing and distributing our pharmaceutical products 
in particular  cost of product sales includes third party manufacturing and distribution costs  the cost of api  freight and shipping  reserves for excess or obsolete inventory and labor  benefits and related employee expenses for personnel involved with overseeing the activities of our third party manufacturers 
cost of product sales excludes amortization of product rights 
we contract with third parties to manufacture all of our products and product candidates 
changes in the price of raw materials and manufacturing costs could adversely affect our gross margins on the sale of our products 
changes in our mix of products sold also will result in variations in our cost of product sales 
accordingly  our management expects gross margins will change as our product mix is altered by changes in demand for our existing products or the launch of new products 
sales and marketing expenses our sales and marketing expenses consist of labor  benefits and related employee expenses for personnel in our sales  marketing and sales operations functions  advertising and promotion costs  including the costs of samples  and the fees we pay under our co promotion agreements to third parties to promote our products  which are based on a percentage of net profits from product sales  determined in accordance with the particular agreement 
the most significant component of our sales and marketing expenses is labor  benefits and related employee expenses 
we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase as we expand our sales and marketing infrastructure to support additional products and product lines and as a result of increased co promotion fees due to greater product sales 
royalty expenses royalty expenses include the contractual amounts we are required to pay the licensors from which we have acquired the rights to our marketed products or third parties to whom we pay royalties under settlement agreements relating to our products 
royalties are generally based on a percentage of the products net sales 
with respect to the hyomax line of products  royalties are based on a percentage of the net profits earned by us on the sale of the products 
although product mix affects our royalties  we generally expect that our royalty expenses will increase as total net product sales increase 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses primarily include labor  benefits and related employee expenses for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business development  information technology  regulatory medical affairs and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in sales and marketing or research and development expenses and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
general and administrative expenses also consist of the costs of maintaining and overseeing our intellectual property portfolio  which include the cost of external legal counsel and the mandatory fees of the us patent and trademark office and foreign patent and trademark offices 
general and administrative expense also includes depreciation expense for our property and equipment  which we depreciate over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight line method 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to build the infrastructure necessary to support our commercialization and product development activities and to meet our compliance obligations as a public company 
in addition  we have incurred additional legal  accounting and related costs relating to our october merger 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of product development expenses incurred in identifying  developing and testing our product candidates and the write off of in process research and development expenses related to the alpha program acquired from critical therapeutics in connection with our merger 
product development expenses consist primarily of labor  benefits and related employee expenses for personnel directly involved in product development activities  fees paid to professional service providers for monitoring and analyzing clinical trials  expenses incurred under joint development agreements  regulatory costs  costs of contract research and manufacturing  and the cost of facilities used by our product development personnel 
we expense product development costs as incurred 
we believe that significant investment in product development is important to our competitive position and plan to increase our expenditures for product development to realize the potential of the product candidates that we are developing or may develop 
our product development expenses reflect costs directly attributable to product candidates in development during the applicable period and to product candidates for which we have discontinued development 
additionally  product development expenses include our costs of qualifying new cgmp third party manufacturers for our products  including expenses associated with any related technology transfer 
we do not allocate indirect costs such as salaries  benefits or other costs related to our accounting  legal  human resources  purchasing  information technology and other general corporate functions to the research and development expenses associated with individual product candidates 
rather  we include these costs in general and administrative expenses 
amortization of product rights we capitalize our costs to license product rights from third parties as such costs are incurred and amortize these amounts on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the product or the remaining trademark or patent life 
we re evaluate the useful life of our products on an annual basis to determine whether the value of our product rights assets have been impaired and appropriately adjust amortization to account for such impairment 
amortization of product rights is expected to increase in the future as we begin amortizing product rights related to new products 
other charges other charges include expenses related to settlements of litigation and the impairment of fixed assets 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
in addition  our reported 
table of contents financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
not all of these significant accounting policies  however  fit the definition of critical accounting estimates 
we believe that our estimates relating to revenue recognition  product rights  inventory  accrued expenses and stock based compensation described below fit the definition of critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition net product sales product sales 
we recognize revenue from our product sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  or sfas  upon transfer of title  which occurs when product is received by our customers 
we sell our products primarily to large national wholesalers  which have the right to return the products they purchase 
under sfas  we are required to reasonably estimate the amount of future returns at the time of revenue recognition 
we recognize product sales net of estimated allowances for product returns  rebates  price adjustments  chargebacks  and prompt payment and other discounts 
product returns 
consistent with industry practice  we offer contractual return rights that allow our customers to return product within an month period  from six months prior to and up to twelve months subsequent to the expiration date of our products 
our products have a to month expiration period from the date of manufacture 
we adjust our estimate of product returns if we become aware of other factors that we believe could significantly impact our expected returns 
these factors include our estimate of inventory levels of our products in the distribution channel  the shelf life of the product shipped  review of consumer consumption data as reported by external information management companies  actual and historical return rates for expired lots  the remaining time to expiration of the product  and the forecast of future sales of the product  as well as competitive issues such as new product entrants and other known changes in sales trends 
we evaluate this reserve on a quarterly basis  assessing each of the factors described above  and adjust the reserve accordingly 
rebates 
the liability for commercial managed care rebates is calculated based on historical and current rebate redemption and utilization rates with respect to each commercial contract 
the liability for medicaid and medicare rebates is calculated based on historical and current rebate redemption and utilization rates contractually submitted by each state 
price adjustments and chargebacks 
our estimates of price adjustments and chargebacks are based on our estimated mix of sales to various third party payors  which are entitled either contractually or statutorily to discounts from the listed prices of our products 
we make these judgments based on the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with gaap 
in the event that the sales mix to third party payors is different from our estimates  we may be required to pay higher or lower total price adjustments and or chargebacks than we have estimated 
special promotional programs 
from time to time  we offer certain promotional incentives to our customers for our products  and we expect that we will continue this practice in the future 
these programs include sample cards to retail consumers  certain product incentives to pharmacy customers and other sales 
table of contents stocking allowances 
we account for these programs in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
we have initiated three voucher programs for spectracef whereby we offer a point of sale subsidy to retail consumers 
we estimate our liability for these voucher programs based on the historical redemption rates for similar completed programs used by other pharmaceutical companies as reported to us by a third party claims processing organization and actual redemption rates for our completed programs 
the first program expired on december  the second and third programs are still ongoing  and we have no present intention to cancel these programs 
we account for the costs of these special promotional programs as price adjustments 
prompt payment discounts 
we typically require customers of branded and generic products to remit payments within days and days  respectively 
in addition  we offer wholesale distributors a prompt payment discount as an incentive to remit payment within the first days after the date of our invoice for branded products and days after the date of our invoice for generic products 
this discount is generally  but may be higher in some instances due to product launches or customer and or industry expectations 
because our wholesale distributors typically take the prompt payment discount  we accrue of the prompt payment discounts  based on the gross amount of each invoice  at the time of our original sale to them  and we apply earned discounts at the time of payment 
we adjust the accrual periodically to reflect actual experience 
historically  these adjustments have not been material 
we do not anticipate that future changes to our estimates of prompt payment discounts will have a material impact on our net revenue 
the following table provides a summary of activity with respect to our sales allowances in thousands price adjustments prompt product and payment returns rebates chargebacks discounts balance at december  current provision related to sales in current period payments and credits balance at december  current provision related to sales in current period current provision related to sales made in prior periods acquired in the merger payments and credits balance at december  expense recognized for product returns was million and million in and  respectively  representing and of gross product sales in and  respectively 
expense recognized for product returns related to current year provisions were million in  or of gross product sales 
expense recognized for product returns related to changes in prior year estimates in were million and related primarily to product returns of deconsal  balacet and spectracef  offset by lower than originally anticipated returns for allerx 
expense recognized for rebates was million and  in and  respectively  representing approximately and of gross product sales in and  respectively 
the increase in rebates is primarily due to the overall increase in sales and our entry into additional supplemental medicaid rebate programs during expense recognized for price adjustments and chargebacks was million and million in and  respectively  representing approximately and of gross product sales in and  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to million and million of increases in price adjustments and chargebacks  respectively  related to the launch of the generic products  which typically have higher levels of price adjustments and chargebacks than branded products 
price adjustments were also increased by 
table of contents million due to the costs of the spectracef point of sale voucher programs for retail customers that we launched in and by  due to increases in price adjustments and chargebacks related to our branded products 
expense recognized for prompt payment discounts was million and  in and  respectively  representing approximately of gross product sales in each year 
royalty agreement revenues we receive royalties under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products to which we have rights 
the license agreements provide for the payment of royalties based on sales of the licensed product 
these revenues are recorded based on estimates of the sales that occurred in the relevant period 
the relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by the licensees and analysis of historical royalties paid  adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
we maintain regular communication with our licensees to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual royalty agreement revenues and estimated royalty agreement revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period in which they become known  typically the following quarter 
product rights product rights are capitalized as incurred and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the product or the remaining trademark or patent life on a straight line or other basis to match the economic benefit received 
amortization begins once fda approval has been obtained and commercialization of the product begins 
we evaluate our product rights annually to determine whether a revision to their useful lives should be made 
this evaluation is based on our management s projection of the future cash flows associated with the products 
at december   we had an aggregate of million in capitalized product rights  which we expect to amortize over a period of seven to fourteen years 
inventory inventory consists of raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
raw materials include the api for a product to be manufactured  work in process includes the bulk inventory of tablets that are in the process of being coated and or packaged for sale  and finished goods include pharmaceutical products ready for commercial sale or distribution as samples 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value with cost determined under the first in  first out  or fifo  method 
our estimate of the net realizable value of our inventories is subject to judgment and estimation 
the actual net realizable value of our inventories could vary significantly from our estimates and could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations in any reporting period 
in evaluating whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  we consider such factors as the amount of inventory on hand and in the distribution channel  estimated time required to sell such inventory  remaining shelf life and current and expected market conditions  including levels of competition 
on a quarterly basis  we analyze our inventory levels and write down inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of the expected net realizable value and inventory that is in excess of expected requirements based upon anticipated product revenues 
as of december   we had million in inventory and an inventory reserve of  the inventory reserve includes provisions for inventory that management believes will become short dated before being sold 
short dated inventory is inventory that has not expired yet  but which wholesalers or pharmacies refuse to purchase because of its near term expiration date 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate certain expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such services as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include product development expenses  reserves for product returns  rebates to third parties  including private insurers and government programs such as medicaid  royalties owed to third parties on sales of products  interest owed on debt instruments  and compensation and benefits for employees 

table of contents stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  using the prospective application method  which requires us to recognize compensation cost for all awards granted or modified after january  awards outstanding at january  continue to be accounted for using the accounting principles originally applied to the award 
the expense associated with stock based compensation is recognized on a straight line basis over the service period of each award 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we recognized employee stock based compensation expense using the intrinsic value method  which measures stock based compensation expense as the amount at which the market price of the stock at the date of grant exceeds the exercise price 
because the exercise price for options awarded to employees is equal to the fair value at the grant date  we did not recognize compensation expense for stock options granted to employees prior to we account for transactions in which services are received in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received from non employees or of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured  in accordance with sfas r 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock based compensation under sfas r 
there are a number of assumptions used to calculate the fair value of stock options or restricted stock issued to employees under this pricing model 
accounting for equity instruments granted by us under sfas r and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  requires us to estimate the fair value of the equity instruments granted 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments are too high or too low  stock based compensation expense will be overstated or understated  respectively 
when equity instruments are granted or sold in exchange for the receipt of goods or services and the value of those goods or services can be readily estimated  we use the value of such goods or services to determine the fair value of the equity instruments 
when equity instruments are granted or sold in exchange for the receipt of goods or services and the value of those goods or services cannot be readily estimated  as is true in connection with most compensatory stock options and warrants granted to employees and non employees  our board of directors determines fair value contemporaneously with the issuance or grant 
the two factors that most affect stock based compensation are the estimate of the underlying fair value of our common stock and the estimate of the stock price volatility 
prior to the completion of the merger on october   cornerstone biopharma s board of directors determined the underlying fair value of cornerstone biopharma s common stock which was exchanged in the merger for shares of our common stock based on cornerstone biopharma s results of operations  the book value of its stock  its available cash  assets and financial condition  its prospects for growth  the economic outlook in general and the condition and outlook of the pharmaceutical industry in particular  its competitive position in the market  the market price of stocks of corporations engaged in the same or similar line of business that are actively traded in a free and open market  either on an exchange or over the counter  positive or negative business developments since the board s last determination of fair value  and such additional factors that it deemed relevant at the time of the grant or issuance 
for example  in addition to the factors enumerated above  cornerstone biopharma s board of directors specifically considered the following in making its determination of fair value 
with respect to the grants on march   may   september  and december   cornerstone biopharma s financial performance was improving due to growing product sales  relatively strong gross margins  and leveraging of its sales force and fixed overhead 
with respect to the grants made on october   the date of the merger  cornerstone biopharma s board of directors considered the fair market value of critical therapeutics common stock 
following the completion of the merger  our board of directors determines the underlying fair value of our common stock based on the market price of our common stock as traded on the nasdaq capital market 

table of contents results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and net revenues the following table sets forth a summary of our net revenues for and  including zyflo cr and zyflo net product sales completed after the closing of our merger on october  year ended december  change change in thousands  except percentages net product sales allerx dose pack allerx dose pack allerx dose pack df allerx dose pack df allerx dose pack pe allerx dose pack pe spectracef balacet hyomax   n a deconsal ct and deconsal dm zyflo cr and zyflo n a other currently marketed products discontinued products total net product sales royalty agreement revenues net revenues does not include the historical sales of zyflo cr and zyflo made by critical therapeutics prior to the completion of the merger on october  net product sales 
net product sales were million in  compared to million in  an increase of approximately million  or 
this increase was primarily due to million in net product sales of the hyomax line of products  the first of which was launched in may  a million increase in net product sales of the allerx dose pack family of products  primarily due to increased sales volume  price increases on all allerx dose pack products and packaging issues in that delayed product shipments until  and  in net product sales of zyflo cr and zyflo during the last two months of royalty agreement revenues 
royalty agreement revenues were million in  compared to million in  a decrease of approximately  or 
this decrease was primarily due to a net decrease in royalty agreement revenues based on the underlying volume of sales pursuant to our license agreements with third parties 
costs and expenses cost of product sales 
cost of product sales exclusive of amortization of product rights of million and million in and  respectively was million in  compared to million in  an increase of approximately million  or 
gross margin exclusive of amortization of product rights of million and million in and  respectively was in and in cost of product sales in and consisted primarily of the expenses associated with manufacturing and distributing products and reserves established for excess or obsolete inventory 
the increase in our gross 
table of contents margin was primarily due to higher gross margins associated with our hyomax line of products  which we launched in we recorded inventory write offs of  and  in and  respectively 
the write offs in and resulted from excess or obsolete inventory that  due to its expiration dating  would not be sold 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million in  compared to million in  an increase of approximately million  or 
this increase was primarily due to the following a million increase in labor  benefits  related employee expenses and travel related expenses  primarily due to the reorganization of our commission based sales force in may  whereby we consolidated all of our sales functions under one national sales director  reduced the size of our sales team from sales professionals to sales professionals and began compensating all of our sales professionals with salaries  bonuses and related benefits 
although this reorganization resulted in a reduction in the total number of employees on our sales force  our labor  benefits  other employee expenses and travel related expenses increased due to the more generous pay  benefits and travel reimbursement packages given to the former commission based sales professionals who were retained following the reorganization  a million increase in co promotion expenses that was primarily due to renegotiated contract terms with our co promotion partners  and a million increase in advertising and promotion expenses  primarily due to product launches and increased promotional efforts 
in addition  sales and marketing expenses in were reduced by million of funding we received from meiji in in connection with the expansion of our sales force that was promoting spectracef 
we received this funding pursuant to a july letter agreement with meiji  which supplemented the spectracef license and supply agreement 
we did not receive any such payments from meiji in royalty expenses 
royalty expenses were million in  compared to million in  an increase of approximately million  or 
this increase was primarily due to the launch of the hyomax line of products in and increased net product sales of the allerx family of products 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in  an increase of approximately million  or 
this increase was primarily due to the following million increase in labor  benefits  related employee expenses and travel related expenses due to our growth during  million in merger related legal and accounting expenses that were not capitalized as direct costs of the merger   increase in fda regulatory related fees   increase in product liability and other insurance related costs   increase in facility lease related costs  and  increase in corporate advertising and promotional costs 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in  compared to  in  an increase of approximately million  or

table of contents successfully complete clinical testing  and expand our sales team and marketing capabilities to prepare for the commercial launch of future products  subject to fda approval 
we also expect to incur additional expenses to add operational  financial and management information systems and personnel  including personnel to support our product development efforts 
accordingly  we will need to increase our revenues to be able to sustain and increase our profitability on an annual and quarterly basis 
there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
our failure to achieve consistent profitability could impair our ability to raise capital  expand our business  diversify our product offerings and continue our operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the level of product sales of our currently marketed products and any additional products that we may market in the future  the scope  progress  results and costs of development activities for our current product candidates  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates  the number of  and development requirements for  additional product candidates that we pursue  the costs of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the costs and timing of establishing manufacturing and supply arrangements for clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and products  the extent to which we acquire or invest in products  businesses and technologies  the extent to which we choose to establish collaboration  co promotion  distribution or other similar arrangements for our marketed products and product candidates  and the costs of preparing  filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing and defending claims related to intellectual property owned by or licensed to us 
to the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements or other financing alternatives 
our only committed external source of funds is borrowing availability under the paragon line of credit  which is described in more detail below under paragon line of credit 
our ability to borrow under the paragon line of credit is subject to our satisfaction of specified conditions 
additional equity or debt financing  or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
as of december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and borrowing availability of million under the paragon line of credit 
based on our current operating plans  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  revenues from product sales and borrowing availability under the paragon line of credit are sufficient to continue to fund our existing level of operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
paragon line of credit in april  we obtained financing under a bank line of credit for up to million with paragon commercial bank 
we have used the paragon line of credit to fund our general operations and product acquisitions 
as amended and renewed in june  the paragon line of credit is subject to a monthly borrowing base equal to of our accounts receivable balances outstanding days or less and of the  assignment of deposits to us by our president and chief executive officer 
because our borrowing base under the paragon line of credit exceeded million as of december   the full amount of the line of credit was available for borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit 
of this amount  we had no borrowings outstanding and had issued letters of credit totaling  resulting in million of available borrowing capacity 
we are currently considering financing alternatives to fund capital expenditures in the future 

table of contents amounts outstanding under the paragon line of credit bear interest at a variable rate equal to the wall street journal prime rate  which was as of december  the paragon line of credit is collateralized by our accounts receivable  inventories  intangible assets  other personal property  a million deed of trust on the personal residence of our president and chief executive officer and an assignment of deposits in the amount of  to us by our president and chief executive officer 
our president and chief executive officer and carolina pharmaceuticals  inc  a company under common control with us  have jointly guaranteed the paragon line of credit 
the paragon line of credit requires  among other requirements  that we not incur any additional debt without paragon s consent and that our president and chief executive officer maintains a certain level of liquid assets and remains primarily employed as one of our executive officers 
interest is due monthly with all outstanding principal due on maturity in june the maximum amount outstanding under the paragon line of credit during was million 
off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet arrangements  including structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues or results of operations since inception 
we expect our cost of product sales and other operating expenses will change in the future in line with periodic inflationary changes in price levels 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our property and equipment  we believe that the incremental inflation related to the replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources 
while our management generally believes that we will be able to offset the effect of price level changes by adjusting our product prices and implementing operating efficiencies  any material unfavorable changes in price levels could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows
