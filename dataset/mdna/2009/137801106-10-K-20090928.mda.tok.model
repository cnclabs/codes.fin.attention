overview introduction we are an independent oil and natural gas company 
our strategy is to exploit our current undeveloped reserves and acquire  where economically prudent  assets suitable for enhanced oil recovery at a low cost 
we intend to convert our proved undeveloped and or unproved reserves into proved producing reserves by applying water  gas and or chemical flooding and other eor techniques 
our assets are located onshore us in texas  new mexico and oklahoma 
during our first three years of operations  our primary objective was to achieve growth through acquiring existing  mature crude oil and natural gas fields 
the last two years we have focused on building the infrastructure and commencing waterflood operations in our two largest properties  panhandle and cato 
these development activities are more clearly described below under drilling capital development and operating activities update 

table of contents we believe our portfolio of crude oil and natural gas properties provides opportunities to apply our operational strategy 
additionally  we will continue to evaluate acquisitions that are consistent with our operational strategy 
overall estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves decreased by mmboe  or  to mmboe as of june   as compared to mmboe as of june  our june  proved reserves of mmboe  were comprised mmboe of pdp  mmboe of pdnp  and mmboe of pud 
crude oil reserves accounted for of our total reserves at june  additional detail of our proved reserves is presented in items and business and properties proved reserves 
at our cato properties  we added approximately  mboe of new reserves in extensions and discoveries due to better than expected initial waterflood response in the phase i area of the project 
cato s production increased from roughly boepd to over boepd as injection into the waterflood pattern commenced in the injection wells and direct crude oil production increases occurred in pattern producing wells 
ultimately  this led to the conversion of approximately  mboe of pud to pdp reserves 
approximately mboe of prior year pud to pdp reserve conversions at our panhandle properties waterflood were reclassified back to pud based upon actual response realized through june  which has been slower than originally estimated 
offsetting the positive extensions and discoveries at our cato properties  mboe were the divestitures of our corsicana and pantwist properties  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  totaling  mboe  the impairment of  mboe at our desdemona barnett shale properties due to the decline in commodity prices during the year ended june  the fiscal year  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  and other revisions primarily driven by the decline in commodity prices and forecast changes which changed the estimated economic lives of our assets  mboe 
a summary of the year on year changes to our proved reserves is shown in the following table summary of changes in proved reserves mboe reserves at june  extensions and discoveries forecast revisions financial revisions impairment sales of assets production reserves at june  reserves were estimated using crude oil and natural gas prices and production and development costs in effect on june  on june   crude oil and natural gas prices were per barrel and per mmbtu  respectively 
the values reported may not necessarily reflect the fair market value of the reserves 
drilling capital development and operating activities update for the fiscal year  we incurred million of capital expenditures million spent to develop our existing fields 
the million difference between the million incurred and the million spent is primarily timing differences related to expenditures incurred during the fiscal year and the payments for those capital expenditures during the fiscal year 
at june   we had accrued capital expenditures of million that were paid during the fiscal year 
the goal for the fiscal year was to convert existing pud reserves to pdp reserves and increase production 
the company drilled and completed wells four asp observation wells at the nowata field  five wells in the panhandle field four harvey unit waterflood development wells and 
table of contents one cockrell ranch infill well  and nine wells at cato six waterflood producers and three waterflood injectors 
for the year ending june  the fiscal year  our board of directors has approved a capital development budget of million as follows million at the cato properties  million at the panhandle properties  and million at the remaining properties 
our fiscal year capital development program does not include the drilling of new wells 
the financing of our capital expenditures is discussed below under liquidity and capital resources 
the following reviews our capital development activity during the fiscal year and planned activity during the fiscal year 
cato properties 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the cato properties were mmboe  of which mmboe were pdp  mmboe were pdnp and mmboe were pud 
these properties include roughly  acres across three fields in chavez and roosevelt counties  new mexico 
the prime asset is the roughly  acre cato field  which produces from the historically prolific san andres formation  which has been successfully waterflooded in the permian basin for over years 
there were two successful waterflood pilots conducted in the field in the s by shell and amoco 
we have experienced encouraging initial waterflood response at the cato field 
the first phase of development phase i includes water injection wells injectors and producing wells producers 
once the injection permits were received in september  we began injecting  barrels of water per day bwipd 
as we continued injecting water into the field  waterflood production has grown from five producers during december offsetting a prior amoco waterflood pilot to producers experiencing production as of june  during january  we increased the injection rate to approximately  bwipd 
during february  we expanded the footprint of phase of the cato waterflood from to roughly acres and announced an increased capital expenditures budget to million  of which million was intended for the cato properties 
we currently have ten sub pumps operating in the field and plan to install additional sub pumps to support increasing production and corresponding higher levels of fluid production 
the sustained production gains at the cato properties are the result of an earlier than expected waterflood production response 
the fiscal year drilling program at cato  which comprised drilling nine wells six waterflood producers and three waterflood injectors  was completed in october normal production declines were experienced outside of the phase i waterflooded area  but these declines were more than offset by increased production from the waterflood 
at june   we booked proved reserves extensions and discoveries at cato as phase i results were better than initially expected 
field production increased from roughly boepd to over boepd after we commenced injection into injection wells of the waterflood pattern which led to increased crude oil production in producers 
when we increased the waterflood footprint from acres to acres  the rate of water injection per acre decreased leading to a temporary decrease in production 
we added approximately mmboe of new reserves based on the responses experienced through june  additionally  mmboe of pud reserves were reclassified to pdp reserves as a result of the responses experienced in phase i 
we plan to increase the number of injection wells and enlarge the waterflood footprint in the fiscal year 
net production at cato averaged boepd in june panhandle properties 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the panhandle properties were mmboe  of which mmboe were pdp and mmboe were pud 
these 
table of contents properties include roughly  acres in carson  gray and hutchinson counties  texas 
they are delineated in thirty three leases the largest of which are cockrell ranch  pond  harvey  mobil fee  cooper  block and schafer ranch 
during the quarter ended june   we maintained our average daily water injection rate at the cockrell ranch unit our first panhandle properties waterflood at roughly  barrels per day 
this resulted in increasing our average daily production at the cockrell ranch unit from approximately net boepd between june and december to maintaining net boepd production through june  while crude oil production continues to increase at cockrell ranch  the gains are below our expectations 
based on actual performance of the waterflood through june   we reclassified mboe of pdp reserves back to pud at june  after this reclassification  the remaining amount of the prior year conversion of pud to pdp reserves is mboe 
we have retained netherland  sewell associates  inc to assist us with reservoir analysis and simulation work at cockrell ranch 
we are establishing a controlled injection pattern to gauge the effects of optimizing water injection into the highest remaining crude oil saturation intervals of the brown dolomite formation our target producing formation 
the result of this field observation  coupled with rigorous reservoir simulation modeling  should allow us to move the project forward into a more predicable production response profile 
moreover  the analysis will improve our planning of future capital development programs for the remaining panhandle properties leases 
waterflood production will be curtailed from the previously reported boepd to boepd during the test period 
as of the end of september  all previously curtailed production will have been restored 
our original fiscal year waterflood capital development plan for the panhandle properties included six separate mini floods on reduced well spacing to enable us to accelerate field development 
tighter well spacing and smaller development patterns should accelerate permitting and response times  allowing a larger development footprint over a greater acreage position 
the amended capital development plan provided for the development of only one mini flood phase through june the harvey unit 
the harvey unit had its waterflood permit application approved by the texas railroad commission on october  the harvey unit mini flood consists of six injection wells and producing wells which required four new wells to be drilled among the existing wells at the field 
the drilling of the four replacement injector wells was completed on january   thus completing the mini flood pattern 
we initiated injection at the harvey unit on march  at a rate of  barrels per day 
during the fiscal year  we received approval of the mini flood permits at the pond lease and at the olive cooper lease 
as a result of the reduction in our capital plan and a focus on our cato properties  we slowed the filing of panhandle mini flood permits 
we now expect to file the appropriate waterflood permits for the remaining three mini floods by the quarter ending december  net production at the panhandle properties for june was boepd 
desdemona properties 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the desdemona properties were mmboe  of which mmboe were pdp and mmboe were pdnp 
approximately mmboe of the reserves were attributable to the duke sand reservoir 
desdemona properties waterflood 
we drilled and completed required replacement wells to initiate the development of the duke sand waterflood on the desdemona properties during the fiscal year having procured and completed infrastructure of the waterflood facilities in september water injection commenced in september through june   we have injected over million barrels of water into a pilot location of the duke sand reservoir 
the primary source of water for the waterflood was from our barnett shale natural gas wells 
during july  we shut in our remaining barnett shale producing wells due to continued low natural gas prices 
accordingly  the source for water injection for our duke sand waterflood pilot ceased 
without a known economic source of water  we will not continue to defer expenditures associated with this waterflood 
therefore  we expensed million during june for the aggregate deferred expenditures spent to implement this waterflood pilot  as discussed 
table of contents in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we continue to believe that this reservoir is an excellent secondary and tertiary recovery candidate  however  we do not have current plans to recommence injection for the foreseeable future 
we had no proved reserves for the duke sand waterflood pilot project 
desdemona properties barnett shale 
we drilled and completed vertical and horizontal wells in the barnett shale during the and fiscal years 
due to the decline in natural gas commodity prices and based upon operating performance  there was uncertainty in the likelihood of developing puds associated with our barnett shale properties 
therefore  during the quarter ended december   we recorded a million pre tax impairment to our barnett shale properties and a million pre tax impairment to the goodwill associated with our subsidiary which holds the equity in our barnett shale properties 
during the quarter ended june   we recorded an additional million pre tax impairment to our barnett shale properties as the forward outlook for natural gas prices continued to decline  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
during july  we shut in our barnett shale natural gas wells  and  based upon the current and near term outlook of natural gas prices  we have no plans to return these wells to production in the foreseeable future 
net production for june at the desdemona properties was boepd 
based upon the previously discussed shut in wells  the production rates are estimated to be boepd for the foreseeable future 
nowata properties 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the nowata properties were mmboe  all of which were pdp 
our asp tertiary recovery pilot project has been in full operation since december through june   we have injected approximately 
pvi of asp and polymer flush 
we drilled and completed four observation wells in december  to enable us to test flood front results in the pilot project 
we completed injecting of our polymer flush during june we anticipate completing the full asp pilot performance analysis within the next three to six months  and we estimate additional completion costs to total million 
there are currently no proved reserves associated with the asp pilot 
net production for june at the nowata properties was boepd 
davenport properties 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the davenport properties were mmboe  of which mmboe were pdp and mmboe were pdnp 
net production at the davenport properties for june was boepd 
industry conditions we operate in a competitive environment for i acquiring properties  ii marketing oil and natural gas and iii attracting trained personnel 
some of our competitors possess and employ financial resources substantially greater than ours and some of our competitors employ more technical personnel 
some of our competitors may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than what our financial or technical resources permit 
our ability to acquire additional properties and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to identify  evaluate and obtain capital for investment in the oil and natural gas industry 
we do believe significant acquisition opportunities exist and will continue to exist as major energy companies and larger independents continue to focus their attention and resources toward the discovery and development of large fields and smaller companies are faced with decreasing margins and access to capital 

table of contents our strategy exploit and develop existing properties 
we believe we have an attractive portfolio of assets to implement our business plan 
we intend to add proved reserves to  and increase production from  our existing properties through the application of commonly used eor technologies  including water  gas and chemical flooding and other techniques 
acquire strategic assets 
we seek to acquire low cost assets with reserves suitable for eor techniques in the onshore us we will continue to target acquisitions that meet our engineering and operational standards in a financially prudent manner 
drill known formations 
our portfolio is composed of mature fields with proved primary and or secondary reserves  existing infrastructure and abundant technical information 
accordingly  our production growth is not dependent on wildcat exploration drilling of new formations and the high degree of speculation associated with making new discoveries  but the application of commonly used secondary and or tertiary recovery methods to increase production and reserves 
eor techniques involve significant capital investment and an extended period of time  generally a year or longer  until production increases 
generally  surfactant polymer injection is regarded as more risky as compared to waterflood operations 
our ability to successfully convert pud reserves to pdp reserves will be contingent upon our ability to obtain future financing and or raise additional capital 
further  there are inherent uncertainties associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas  as well as price volatility 
see item a 
risk factors 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital and liquidity have been issuance of securities  borrowings under our credit agreements  and cash flows from operating activities 
these sources are discussed in greater detail below 
for the twelve months ended june   our primary sources of cash were receipts from the sale of crude oil and natural gas production  issuances of common stock  net borrowings under our credit agreements  sales of oil and gas properties  payments for in the money commodity derivative contracts  settlements from third parties and the wo settlement pertaining to the panhandle fire litigation as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our cash receipts from sales are discussed in greater detail under results of operations operating revenues 
the non revenue sources of cash are discussed in greater detail below on july   we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of million shares of our common stock 
the net proceeds were used to pay down long term debt due under our senior credit agreement see note to our consolidated financial statements 
on october   we sold our wholly owned subsidiary  pantwist  llc pantwist  for million million net of closing adjustments of million of discontinued operating income recorded in the first quarter of the fiscal year and million in advisory fees see note to our consolidated financial statements 
during october  we sold certain uncovered floor price commodity derivative contracts covering july to december for million to our counterparty  and during november  we sold all remaining uncovered floor price commodity derivative contracts covering november through june for million to our counterparty 
we recorded a realized gain of million and an unrealized gain of million as a result of these transactions 
on october   an independent electrical contractor paid us million its full insurance policy limit in exchange for a full release of any existing or future claims related to wildfires that began on march  in carson county  texas 
the million has been fully 
table of contents expended to cover the settlements discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
on december   we sold our interests in the corsicana properties for million see note to our consolidated financial statements 
on december   we finalized new senior and subordinated credit facilities  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
for the senior credit facility  the initial and current borrowing base  based upon our proved reserves  is million and has an outstanding balance of million as of september  we have fully drawn the million borrowing under the subordinated credit facility 
our two credit facilities are discussed in greater detail below 
during the twelve month period ended june   our cash outlays were primarily for lease operating expense  general and administrative expenses  and the settlement and legal fees associated with the fire litigation claims  which are discussed in greater detail in note to our consolidated financial statements and under results of operations operating expenses 
capital expenditures  which are discussed in greater detail under drilling capital development and operating activities update 
the repurchase of  shares of series d convertible preferred stock  including accrued and unpaid pik dividends relating to such shares for approximately million  which is discussed in greater detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
as discussed under drilling capital development and operating activities  we have million of capital expenditures during the twelve month period ended june  million of the incurred million pertains to secondary and tertiary exploration activities new projects where no secondary or tertiary reserves have previously been recorded 
as of june   we had implemented one tertiary exploration project that has existing reserves associated with secondary recovery activities the asp tertiary recovery pilot project at the nowata properties 
this project is considered exploratory as it entails more risk compared to our development activities where proved secondary or tertiary reserves exist since this project did not have proved tertiary reserves prior to its implementation 
we estimate the crude oil price necessary to sustain the long term economic viability of this project is approximately per barrel 
this price could vary based on several factors  including actual recovery rates and chemical costs 
liquidity at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
our working capital balance included a million derivative current asset and a million deferred tax current liability 
for the year ended june   we had net income applicable to common stock of million and a loss from operations of million  including a million impairment of long lived assets see note to our consolidated financial statements  million of exploration expense see note to our consolidated financial statements and million of legal and settlement expenses in connection with the panhandle fire litigation see note to our consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended june   our cash used in operations of million was negatively impacted by million of settlement payments  net of reimbursements  related to the resolution of the panhandle fire litigation 
we depend on our credit agreements  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  to fund a portion of our operating and capital needs 
under our senior credit agreement  the initial and current borrowing base  based upon our proved reserves  is million 
at june   our remaining available borrowing capacity under the senior credit agreement was million  
table of contents and at september   our remaining borrowing capacity was million 
pursuant to the terms of our senior credit agreement  our borrowing base is to be redetermined based upon our june  reserve report 
we have submitted our reserve report and other financial information to our lenders as part of the redetermination process 
at june   we were in compliance with the debt covenants contained in each of our credit agreements 
the determination for the twelve month period ending december  will be the first financial covenant tests which exclude the gain from our sale of the pantwist properties see note to our consolidated financial statements 
based upon our six month operating results through june   we may not be in compliance with all of our financial covenants when we reach the twelve month period ending december  if a combination of increased production  rising commodity prices  changes in our capital structure and other actions do not occur by december   we anticipate not being in compliance with the covenants 
in that event  we will seek covenant relief from our lenders  though there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such relief 
we have taken  and are considering taking  actions to ensure the aforementioned covenant compliance and sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations for the twelve months ending june   which includes funding our capital expenditure budget of million 
actions we have taken during the six month period ended june  to improve liquidity include negotiating lower service rates with vendors  employee workforce reductions and shutting in uneconomic wells 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have derivative contracts in place to protect us from falling crude oil and natural gas commodity prices on a portion of our production through december and rising interest rates related to a portion of our outstanding debt through january 
we are also considering credit and capital markets alternatives 
during each year of our prior five years in existence  we have successfully accessed the credit and capital markets to fund our operations and capital needs 
we believe the combination of i cash on hand  ii cash flow generated from the expected success of prior capital development projects  iii debt available under our credit agreements and iv our ability to access the equity markets  provide sufficient means to conduct our operations  meet our contractual obligations and undertake our capital expenditure program for the twelve months ending june  as previously discussed in the section titled drilling capital development and operating activities update 
to the extent that cash on hand as of june   cash flow generated by operations subsequent to june  and borrowings under our credit agreements are insufficient to fund our operating cash flow requirements and our capital expenditure plans  we will need to i raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities  ii refinance our existing credit arrangements  iii divest oil and gas property assets  iv reduce operating and capital expenditures and v pursue strategic alternatives 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in refinancing our credit arrangements or raising capital through the issuance of our debt or equity securities 
on december   our universal shelf registration statement was declared effective by the sec for the issuance of common stock  preferred stock  warrants  senior debt and subordinated debt up to an aggregate amount of million 
after the issuance of common stock on july   we have million of availability under this registration  however  the amount of securities which we may offer pursuant to this shelf registration statement during any twelve month period shall be limited to one third of the aggregate market value of the common equity of the company held by our non affiliates since our public float is not in excess of million 
we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts  prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered 
at the time any of the securities covered by the registration statement are offered for sale  a prospectus supplement will be prepared and filed with the sec containing specific information about the terms of any such offering 

table of contents historically  our primary sources of capital and liquidity have been issuance of equity securities  borrowings under our credit agreements  and cash flows from operating activities 
our two credit agreements are discussed in greater detail as presented below 
for the fiscal year  we expect to fund our operations and capital expenditures from cash from operations  our credit agreements and the capital markets 
to develop our reserves as reported in our june  reserve report  we will require access to the capital markets in each of the next four years  as our projected capital expenditures are greater than projected cash flow from operations through december credit agreements at june  and  the outstanding amount due under our credit agreements was million and million  respectively 
the million at june   consisted of outstanding borrowings under the senior and subordinated credit agreements of million and million  respectively 
at june   the average interest rates under the senior and subordinated credit agreements were and  respectively 
our long term debt consists of our senior credit facility current borrowing base of million and our subordinated credit agreement million availability  which are discussed in greater detail below

table of contents results of operations years ended june   and overall for the fiscal year  we had income applicable to common stock of million  which was a million improvement as compared to the million loss applicable to common stock for the fiscal year 
items that led to the improvement were increased gain on derivatives of million  preferred stock repurchased for less than the carrying amount of million  higher income from discontinued operations of million and lower preferred stock dividend of million 
these positive factors were partially offset by higher operating expenses of million  lower operating revenues of million  lower deferred income tax benefit of million and goodwill impairment of million 
for the fiscal year  we had a loss applicable to common stock of million  which was million greater than the million loss applicable to common stock incurred for the year ended june  the fiscal year 
increased revenues of million  increased deferred tax benefit of million and lower interest expense of million were more than offset by higher loss on commodity derivatives of million  higher operating expenses of million  lower income from discontinued operations of million and increased preferred stock dividend of million

fiscal year the fiscal year operating revenues of million were million lower as compared to the fiscal year operating revenues of million 
the million reduction is primarily attributable to lower prices received for crude oil and natural gas sales  which lowered revenues by million and million  respectively  and by lower natural gas sales volumes  which lowered revenues by million 
these decreases were partially offset by increased crude oil sales volumes  which increased revenues by million 

table of contents the impact of lower prices for crude oil and natural gas sales  as discussed above  is partially mitigated by commodity derivative settlements received during the fiscal year as presented in the preceding table 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  if crude oil and natural gas nymex prices are lower than derivative floor prices  we will be reimbursed by our counterparty for the difference between the nymex price and floor price ie realized gain 
conversely  if crude oil and natural gas nymex prices are higher than the derivative ceiling prices  we will pay our counterparty for the difference between the nymex price and ceiling price ie realized loss 
crude oil sales 
for the fiscal year  approximately of the increased crude oil sales of mbbls were attributed to development activity at the cato properties  as previously discussed under the drilling capital development and operating activities update 
also  we had increased crude oil sales from the panhandle properties due to development activity previously discussed under drilling capital development and operating activities update 
natural gas sales 
for the fiscal year  the overall decrease in natural gas sales of mmcf pertains primarily to reductions with respect to our barnett shale project at our desdemona properties 
during the first half of calendar year  various workovers and re fracture stimulations were attempted to increase production 
through december  these efforts were met with marginal success 
in january  we halted our workover program in the desdemona properties barnett shale 
once the workover activity ceased  we experienced normal barnett shale annual production declines of approximately 
in july  we shut in our barnett shale natural gas wells and  based upon the current and near term outlook of natural gas prices  we have no plans to return these wells to production in the foreseeable future 
also  higher gas production from the cato properties due to the aforementioned development activity was offset by lower gas production from our panhandle properties due to normal field decline of approximately annually and temporary pipeline curtailments of gas deliveries by our gas purchasers 
crude oil and natural gas prices 
the average price we receive for crude oil sales is generally at market prices received at the wellhead  except for the cato properties  for which we receive below market prices due to the levels of impurities in the oil 
differentials gapped briefly as commodity prices rapidly declined between july and december  however  the differentials have since recovered with the higher crude oil prices 
the average price we receive for natural gas sales is approximately the market price received at the wellhead  adjusted for the value of natural gas liquids  less transportation and marketing expenses 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have commodity derivatives in place that provide for to crude oil floor prices and to natural gas floor prices 
if crude oil and natural gas nymex prices are lower than the floor prices  we will be reimbursed by our counterparty for the difference between the nymex price and floor price 
we expect to grow sales through our development plans as previously discussed under overview drilling capital development and operating activities update 
fiscal year v 
fiscal year the fiscal year operating revenues of million represent an improvement of million as compared to the fiscal year operating revenues of million 
the million improvement is primarily attributable to higher realized prices received for crude oil and natural gas sales  as shown in the above table  which led to increases of million and million  respectively  and 
table of contents a full twelve months of cato properties operating revenues versus three months in fiscal year which contributed an additional million to operating revenues 
operating expenses fiscal year v 
fiscal year for the fiscal year  our total operating expenses were million  or million higher than the fiscal year of million 
the primary contributors to the increase were an impairment of long lived assets of million and exploration expense of million associated with the desdemona properties duke sands waterflood project 
in addition  we experienced increased lease operating expenses of million  general and administrative of million and higher depletion and depreciation of million 
fiscal year v 
fiscal year for the fiscal year  our total operating expenses were million  or million higher than the fiscal year of million 
the million increase is primarily attributed to increased lease operating expenses of million  higher general and administrative expenses of million  higher production and ad valorem taxes of million and increased depletion and depreciation expense of million 
lease operating expenses our lease operating expenses loe consist of the costs of producing crude oil and natural gas such as labor  supplies  repairs  maintenance  workovers and utilities 
for the fiscal year  our loe was million  which is million higher than fiscal year of million 
the million increase resulted primarily from increased workover activities and general repairs at the panhandle properties of million and higher operating expenses incurred at the cato properties of million to support increased crude oil and natural gas sales  as discussed under operating revenues  partially offset by lower operating expenses of million due to lower natural gas sales at the desdemona properties  as discussed under operating revenues 
we also had higher loe at the davenport and nowata properties of million due to increased electricity expenses  general repairs and workover expenses 
the workover activities at the panhandle properties pertained to returning wells to production and have increased production  as discussed under operating revenues  and are expected to result in increased production in future months 
for the fiscal year  our loe per boe  based on production  was as compared to for the fiscal year 
in general  secondary and tertiary loe is higher than the loe for companies developing primary production because our fields are more mature and typically produce less oil and more water 
we expect the loe to decrease during the fiscal year as we realize the benefit of a full year of lower service rates with vendors  and we expect loe per boe to decrease as production increases from the waterflood and eor development activities we have implemented and are implementing as discussed under the drilling capital development and operating activities update 
we did experience decreases in our loe per boe during the fiscal year as the loe per boe for the six months ended june  was  which is lower than the loe per boe for the six months ended december  for the fiscal year  our loe was million  which is million higher as compared to the fiscal year loe of million 
we incurred higher loe due to the inclusion of the cato properties of million  increased lifting costs at the desdemona properties of million  increased workover rig expenses at the panhandle and pantwist properties of million and increased electricity expense of million 
other factors contributing to higher loe were increased crude oil and natural 
table of contents gas sales  as discussed under operating revenues  and generally higher costs for goods and services 
our loe for the fiscal year included a full year of cato properties operating results versus three months in the fiscal year 
our loe per boe has increased from during the fiscal year to for the fiscal year  for the reasons previously discussed 
production and ad valorem taxes for the fiscal year  our production and ad valorem taxes were million  which is million lower than the fiscal year of million 
our production taxes were lower by million due to lower operating revenues and were partially offset by increased ad valorem taxes of million 
the increased ad valorem taxes were due to notification of revisions in tax property valuations by taxing authorities for the calendar year 
therefore  the fiscal year includes higher tax rates for the twelve months plus a charge for applying the rates to the first six months of the calendar year 
our production taxes as a percent of operating revenues for the fiscal year of was comparable to the fiscal years of 
we anticipate the fiscal year to be subject to similar production tax rates 
for the fiscal year  our production and ad valorem taxes were million  which is million higher than the fiscal year of million 
the million increase is attributable to higher operating revenues  as previously discussed 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative g a expenses consist of support services for our operating activities and investor relations costs 
fiscal year v 
fiscal year for the fiscal year  our g a expenses totaled million  which is million higher than fiscal year of million 
the primary contributors to the million increase were higher litigation costs of million pertaining to the settlement costs and legal fees pertaining of the fire litigation as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements and increased stock compensation expense of million partially offset by reduced payroll expense of million 
during the quarter ended march   we took steps to reduce our payroll  eliminating of our home office staff 
the quarter ended june  was the first time we realized these savings 
since we have settled all fire litigation claims except for one lawsuit  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we expect significant decreases in future quarters legal expenses 
also  the previously discussed workforce reductions are expected to reduce payroll and benefits costs by million annually 
fiscal year v 
fiscal year for the fiscal year  our g a expenses totaled million  which is million higher than fiscal year of million 
the primary contributors to the million increase were increased stock compensation expense of million resulting from the issuance of stock options as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements and the issuance of restricted shares as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  increased labor and staffing costs of million  which includes the accrual of bonuses earned during the fiscal year and the payment of bonuses during the quarter ended december   and 
table of contents higher legal fees of million pertaining to the fire litigation as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these increases were partially offset by lower fees of million for accounting services to achieve full compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act and reductions totaling million pertaining to other expenses 
impairment of long lived assets during the fiscal year  we recorded a million impairment on our barnett shale properties 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the decline in commodity prices created an uncertainty in the likelihood of developing our reserves associated with our barnett shale natural gas properties within the next five years 
therefore  during the quarter ended december   we recorded a million pre tax impairment to our barnett shale properties 
during the quarter ended june   we recorded an additional million pre tax impairment to our barnett shale properties as the forward outlook for natural gas prices continued to decline and we shut in our barnett shale natural gas wells 
the fair value was determined using estimates of future production volumes  prices and operating expenses  discounted to a present value 
exploration expense during the fiscal year  we recorded exploration expense of million pertaining to the duke sands waterflood project 
the primary source of water for this waterflood project had been derived from our barnett shale wells 
since we have shut in our barnett shale natural gas production due to uneconomic natural gas commodity prices  as previously discussed  we no longer have an economic source of water to continue flooding the duke sands 
therefore  our rate of water injection has been reduced to a point where we cannot consider the waterflood active 
we continue to believe that this reservoir is an excellent secondary and tertiary recovery candidate  however  we do not have current plans to recommence injection for the foreseeable future 
depletion and depreciation for the fiscal year  our depletion and depreciation expense was million  an increase of million as compared to the fiscal year depletion and depreciation expense of million 
this includes depletion expense pertaining to our oil and natural gas properties  and depreciation expense pertaining to our field operations vehicles and equipment  natural gas plant  office furniture and computers 
the increase is due to increased crude oil and natural gas sales volumes net as previously discussed under operating revenues and higher per boe depletion rates 
for the fiscal year  our depletion rate pertaining to our oil and gas properties was per boe  as compared to the fiscal year rate of per boe 
the increased depletion rates resulted from higher depletion rates for our cato and panhandle properties based on our reserve redetermination at june  and periodic reassessments of depletion rates during the fiscal year 
for the fiscal year  our depletion and depreciation expense was million  an increase of million as compared to the fiscal year depletion and depreciation expense of million 
this includes depletion expense pertaining to our oil and natural gas properties  and depreciation expense pertaining to our field operations vehicles and equipment  natural gas plant  office furniture and computers 
the increase is due to increased crude oil and natural gas sales volumes as previously discussed under operating revenues and higher per boe depletion rates 
for the fiscal year  our depletion rate pertaining to our oil and gas properties was per boe  as compared to fiscal year rate of per boe 
the higher depletion rates resulted from a reduction of reserves for the desdemona barnett shale and pantwist properties  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  and higher depletion rates attributed to the cato properties 

table of contents interest expense and other for the  and fiscal years  we incurred interest expense of million  million and million  respectively  as a direct result of the credit agreements we entered into  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the interest expense for the  and fiscal years was reduced by million  million and million  respectively  for interest cost that was capitalized to the waterflood and asp projects discussed under the drilling capital development and operating activities update 
we incurred higher interest costs during the fiscal year due to higher outstanding debt balances and higher interest rates 
gain loss on commodity derivatives as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have entered into financial contracts for our commodity derivatives and an interest rate swap arrangement 
for the fiscal year  we recorded a gain on derivatives of million as compared to losses of million and million for the and fiscal years  respectively 
the fiscal year gain consisted of an unrealized gain of million  a realized gain on settlements of commodity derivative contracts of million and a million realized gain on the sale of floor priced contracts 
the fiscal year loss consists of unrealized and realized losses of million and million  respectively 
for the fiscal year  we incurred an unrealized loss of million and a realized gain of million 
for the realization of settlements  if crude oil and natural gas nymex prices are lower than the floor prices  we will be reimbursed by our counterparty for the difference between the nymex price and floor price ie realized gain 
conversely  if crude oil and natural gas nymex prices are higher than the ceiling prices  we will pay our counterparty for the difference between the nymex price and ceiling price ie realized loss 
the unrealized gain for the fiscal year reflects the fair value of the commodity derivatives as of june  by their nature  these commodity derivatives can have a highly volatile impact on our earnings 
a five percent change in the prices for our commodity derivative instruments could impact our pre tax earnings by approximately million 
income tax benefit expense for the fiscal year  we had income tax expense of million  as compared to an income tax benefit for the and fiscal years of million and million  respectively 
these tax amounts included taxes related to discontinued operations as shown in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the increased income taxes for the fiscal year  as compared to the and fiscal years  is due to the increase in taxable income and an increase in the state tax rate and other permanent items  as presented in note to our consolidated financial statements  resulting in an aggregate rate of 
the income tax rates for the and fiscal years was for each year 
income from discontinued operations for the  and fiscal years  we had income from discontinued operations of million  million and million  respectively  due to our divestitures of the pantwist  llc  corsicana properties and rich valley properties  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents preferred stock dividend the preferred stock dividend for the fiscal year of million was a decrease of million from million for fiscal year 
this resulted from the november and december repurchases of preferred stock as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
due to the repurchases  our quarterly preferred stock dividends will be approximately million per quarter of which will be pik  with the remaining balance paid in cash 
also  the fiscal year amount includes million of federal tax we were required to withhold in accordance with internal revenue service regulations from september through june these amounts did not have a material effect to our prior period financial statements 
due to the previously discussed repurchases  we no longer have any preferred stock that required withholding taxes 
the preferred stock dividend for the fiscal year of million was million higher than the million for the fiscal year 
this is primarily due to million federal tax withholding previously discussed

critical accounting policies we have identified the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
these are the accounting policies that we have determined involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
gaap requires management to make judgments and estimates  including choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 

table of contents oil and gas properties and equipment we follow the successful efforts method of accounting 
exploration expenses  including geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals  are charged to expense 
the costs of drilling and equipping exploratory wells are deferred until the company has determined whether proved reserves have been found 
if proved reserves are found  the deferred costs are capitalized as part of the wells and related equipment and facilities 
if no proved reserves are found  the deferred costs are charged to expense 
all development activity costs are capitalized 
we are primarily engaged in the development and acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties 
our activities are considered development where existing proved reserves are identified prior to commencement of the project and are considered exploration if there are no proved reserves at the beginning of such project 
the property costs reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets resulted from acquisition and development activities and deferred exploratory drilling costs 
capitalized overhead costs that directly relate to our drilling and development activities were million and million  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
we recorded capitalized interest costs of million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
costs for repairs and maintenance to sustain or increase production from existing producing reservoirs are charged to expense 
significant tangible equipment added or replaced that extends the useful or productive life of the property is capitalized 
costs to construct facilities or increase the productive capacity from existing reservoirs are capitalized 
costs to construct facilities or increase the productive capacity from existing reservoirs are capitalized 
depreciation and depletion of producing properties are computed on the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves 
our unit of production amortization rates are revised prospectively on a quarterly basis based on updated engineering information for our proved developed reserves 
our development costs and lease and wellhead equipment are depleted based on proved developed reserves 
our leasehold costs are depleted based on total proved reserves 
investments in major development projects are not depleted until such project is substantially complete and producing or until impairment occurs 
as of june  and  capitalized costs related to waterflood and asp projects that were in process and not subject to depletion amounted to million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  were deferred costs related to drilling and equipping exploratory wells as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
if conditions indicate that long term assets may be impaired  the carrying value of our properties is compared to management s future estimated pre tax cash flow from the properties 
if undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  then the asset value is written down to fair value 
impairment of individually significant unproved properties is assessed on a property by property basis  and impairment of other unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis 
the impairment assessment is affected by factors such as the results of exploration and development activities  commodity price projections  remaining lease terms  and potential shifts in our business strategy 
asset retirement obligation our financial statements reflect the fair value for any asset retirement obligation  consisting of future plugging and abandonment expenditures related to our oil and gas properties  which can be reasonably estimated 
the asset retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value at the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to producing properties on the consolidated balance sheets 
periodic accretion of the discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents estimates of proved reserves the term proved reserves is defined by the sec in rule a of regulation s x adopted under the securities act of  as amended 
in general  proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological or engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based on future conditions 
our estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense 
if proved reserves decline  then the rate at which we record depletion expense increases 
a decline in estimates of proved reserves may result from lower prices  new information obtained from development drilling and production history  mechanical problems on our wells  and catastrophic events such as explosions  hurricanes and floods 
lower prices also may make it uneconomical to drill wells or produce from fields with high operating costs 
in addition  a decline in proved reserves may impact our assessment of our oil and natural gas properties for impairment 
our proved reserve estimates are a function of many assumptions  all of which could deviate materially from actual results 
as such  reserve estimates may vary materially from the ultimate quantities of crude oil and natural gas actually produced 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition is based on the sales method of recording revenue 
we do not have imbalances for natural gas sales 
we recognize revenue when crude oil and natural gas quantities are delivered to or collected by the respective purchaser 
title to the produced quantities transfers to the purchaser at the time the purchaser receives or collects the quantities 
prices for such production are defined in sales contracts and are readily determinable based on publicly available information 
the purchasers of such production have historically made payment for crude oil and natural gas purchases within thirty five days of the end of each production month 
we periodically review the difference between the dates of production and the dates we collect payment for such production to ensure that accounts receivable from the purchasers are collectible 
the point of sale for our crude oil and natural gas production is at our applicable field tank batteries and gathering systems  therefore  we do not incur transportation costs related to our sales of crude oil and natural gas production 
as previously discussed  for the years ended june   and  we sold our crude oil and natural gas production to several independent purchasers 
the following table shows purchasers that accounted for or more of our total revenues year ended june  valero marketing supply co 
coffeeville resources refinery and marketing  llc plains marketing  lp eagle rock field services  lp dcp midstream  lp less than of operating revenue in the event that one or more of these significant purchasers ceases doing business with us  we believe that there are potential alternative purchasers with whom we could establish new relationships and that those relationships would result in the replacement of one or more lost purchasers 
we would 
table of contents not expect the loss of any single purchaser to have a long term material adverse effect on our operations  though we may experience a short term decrease in our revenues as we make arrangements for alternative purchasers 
however  the loss of a single purchaser could potentially reduce the competition for our crude oil and natural gas production  which could negatively impact the prices we receive 
stock based compensation expense we account for share based payment arrangements with employees and directors at their grant date fair value and record the related expense over their respective vesting periods 
the value of stock based compensation is impacted by our stock price  which has been highly volatile  and items that require management s judgment  such as expected lives and forfeiture rates 
derivatives we are required to hedge a portion of our production at specified prices for oil and natural gas under our senior and subordinated credit agreements  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the purpose of the derivatives is to reduce our exposure to declining commodity prices 
by locking in minimum prices  we protect our cash flows which support our annual capital expenditure plans 
we have entered into commodity derivatives that involve costless collars for our crude oil and natural gas sales 
these derivatives are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets based upon their respective fair values 
we have entered into an interest rate basis swap contract to reduce our exposure to future interest rate increases 
we do not designate our derivatives as cash flow or fair value hedges 
we do not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our commodity and interest rate swap derivatives 
we anticipate  however  that our counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their respective obligations under our commodity and interest rate swap derivatives contracts 
we do not obtain collateral or other security to support our commodity derivatives contracts nor are we required to post any collateral 
we monitor the credit standing of our counterparties to understand our credit risk 
changes in the fair values of our derivative instruments and cash flows resulting from the settlement of our derivative instruments are recorded in earnings as gains or losses on derivatives on our consolidated statements of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk pursuant to our credit agreements  we are subject to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations  as described under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources credit agreements 
we have partially mitigated this risk by implementing an interest rate swap agreement  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
this agreement is effective through january  and establishes a fixed libor rate for million in notional exposure 
during our fiscal year ended june   if there had been an increase in the interest rate of  our total interest cost would have increased by million annually 
commodity risk our revenues are derived from the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production 
the prices for oil and natural gas are extremely volatile and sometimes experience large fluctuations as a result of relatively small changes in supplies  weather conditions  economic conditions and government actions 
pursuant to our senior and subordinated credit agreements discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we are required to maintain our existing commodity derivative contracts  all of which have ubna as our counterparty 
we have no obligation to enter into commodity derivative contracts in the future 
should we choose to enter into commodity derivative contracts to mitigate future price risk  we cannot enter into contracts for greater than of our crude oil and natural gas production volumes attributable to proved producing reserves for a given month 
therefore  for the hedged production  we will receive at least the floor prices 
as of june   we maintained the following commodity derivative contracts time period floor oil price ceiling oil price barrels per day floor gas price ceiling gas price mcf per day barrels of equivalent oil per day assuming that the prices that we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production are above the floor prices  based on our actual fiscal year sales volumes for the year ended june   a decline in the prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production would have had an approximate million negative impact on our revenues 

table of contents we computed our mark to market valuations used for our commodity derivatives based on assumptions regarding forward prices  volatility and the time value of money 
we compared our valuations to our counterparties valuations to further validate our mark to market valuations 
during the year ended june   we recognized an unrealized gain on commodity derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations amounting to million 
during the years ended june  and  we recognized an unrealized loss on commodity derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations amounting to million and million  respectively 
if crude oil prices fell below our hedged crude oil price floor  we would receive approximately million annually due to having the crude oil price floor hedge in place 
if natural gas prices fell below our hedged natural gas price floor  we would receive approximately million annually due to having the natural gas price floor hedge in place 
on september   we entered into two fixed price commodity swap contracts with our counterparty natixis  which is one of our lenders under the senior credit agreement 
the fixed price swaps are based on west texas intermediate nymex prices and are summarized in the table below 
time period fixed oil price barrels per day
