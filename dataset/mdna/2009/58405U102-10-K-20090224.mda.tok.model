 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied with existing us generally accepted accounting principles requiring use of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements

table of contents medco health solutions  inc 
notes to consolidated financial statements continued partial deferral in fasb staff position fsp fas  partial deferral of the effective date of statement fsp fas  as noted below 
the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on the company s financial position or operating results 
fsp fas deferred the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november  for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the adoption of fsp fas in is not expected to have an impact on the company s consolidated statements of financial position or results of operations but may result in additional fair value disclosures related to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities 
in october  the fasb issued fsp fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp fas  which clarified the determination of the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
effective upon issuance  the company s adoption of fsp fas did not have an impact on the company s financial position or operating results 
fair value hierarchy 
sfas defines the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data 
level unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity s own assumptions 
the company utilizes the best available information in measuring fair value

the company s money market mutual funds are invested in funds that seek to preserve principal  are highly liquid  and therefore are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at the principal amounts deposited  which equals the asset values quoted by the money market fund custodians 
available for sale investments classified as level are measured using quoted market prices for identical assets 
the company s interest rate swap agreements are valued using observable market inputs  and therefore are classified within level historically  there have not been significant fluctuations in the fair value of the financial assets

the company s equity investments are not significant 
intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash includes currency on hand and time deposits with banks or other financial institutions

as a result of the company s normal payment cycle  cash disbursement accounts representing outstanding checks not yet presented for payment of  million and  million are included in claims and other accounts payable  and client rebates and guarantees payable at december  and december   respectively  including certain amounts reclassified from cash 
no overdraft or unsecured short term loan exists in relation to these negative balances 
short term investments 
the company holds short term investments in us government securities to satisfy the statutory capital requirements for the company s insurance subsidiaries

the company has no exposure to or investments in any instruments associated with the sub prime loan market 
fair value of financial instruments 
the carrying amount of cash  accounts receivable  claims and other accounts payable  client rebates and guarantees payable  the accounts receivable financing facility  and the term loan and revolving credit obligations under the company s senior unsecured bank credit facilities approximated fair values as of december  and december  the company estimates fair market value for these assets and liabilities based on their market values or estimates of the present value of their cash flows 
the estimated aggregate fair value of the senior notes and the senior notes equaled million and  million  respectively  at december  the fair values are based on observable relevant market information 
the estimated aggregate fair value of the company s million senior notes was million and million at december  and december   respectively  and is based on observable relevant market information 
the fair value of the company s obligation under its interest rate swap agreements  which hedge interest costs on the senior notes  is based upon observable market based inputs that reflect the present values of the difference between estimated future fixed rate payments and future variable rate receipts and represented a net receivable of million as of december   which is reported in other noncurrent assets  and a net payable of million as of december   which was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities  with an offsetting amount recorded in long term debt  net 
the fair value of the company s obligation under its forward starting interest rate swap agreements  which hedged the changes in the expected future interest rate payments on the proposed debt offering attributable to fluctuations in the treasury benchmark interest rate  was calculated as the net present value of the hedged transaction  and was million million  net of tax as of december   these agreements were settled prior to december  see note  debt  for additional information 
accounts receivable 
the company separately reports accounts receivable due from manufacturers and accounts receivable due from clients 
manufacturer accounts receivable  net  includes billed and estimated unbilled receivables from manufacturers for earned rebates and other prescription services 
unbilled rebates receivable from manufacturers are generally billed beginning days from the end of each quarter

unbilled pbm receivables are primarily from clients and are typically billed within days based on the contractual billing schedule agreed upon with each client 
at the end of 
table of contents medco health solutions  inc 
notes to consolidated financial statements continued any given reporting period  unbilled pbm receivables from clients may represent up to two weeks of dispensing activity and will fluctuate at the end of a fiscal month depending on the timing of these billing cycles 
client accounts receivable  net  also includes a reduction for rebates and guarantees payable to clients when such are settled on a net basis in the form of an invoice credit 
in cases where rebates and guarantees are settled with the client on a net basis  and the rebates and guarantees payable are greater than the corresponding client accounts balances  the net liability is reclassified to client rebates and guarantees payable on the consolidated balance sheets 
when these payables are settled in the form of a check or wire  they are recorded on a gross basis and the entire liability is reflected in client rebates and guarantees payable on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company s client accounts receivable also includes receivables from cms for the company s medicare part d prescription drug program medicare part d product offerings and premiums from members

as a result  this component of the pbm business experiences slower accounts receivable turnover 
as of december  and december   identified net specialty pharmacy accounts receivable  primarily due from payors and patients  amounted to million and million  respectively 
a portion of the specialty pharmacy business includes reimbursement by payors  such as insurance companies  under a medical benefit  or by medicare or medicaid 
these transactions also involve higher patient co payments than experienced in the pbm business 
as a result  this portion of the specialty pharmacy business  which yields a higher margin than the pbm business  experiences slower accounts receivable turnover than in the aforementioned pbm cycle and has a different credit risk profile 
see note  segment reporting  for more information on the specialty pharmacy segment 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and december  of million and million  respectively  includes million and million  respectively  related to the specialty pharmacy segment

the company s allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and december  also includes million and million  respectively  related to polymedica for diabetes supplies  which are primarily reimbursed by insurance companies and government agencies 
in addition  the company s allowance for doubtful accounts also reflects amounts associated with member premiums for the company s medicare part d product offerings 
the company regularly reviews and analyzes the adequacy of the allowances based on a variety of factors  including the age of the outstanding receivable and the collection history 
when circumstances related to specific collection patterns change  estimates of the recoverability of receivables are adjusted

the company actively monitors the status of its accounts receivable and has mechanisms in place to minimize the potential for incurring material accounts receivable credit risk 
concentration of credit risk relating to these accounts receivable  excluding the largest client noted above  is limited by the diversity and number of patients and payors

the company purchases its pharmaceuticals either directly from its primary wholesaler  amerisourcebergen corp  which accounted for approximately and of the company s and drug purchases  respectively  or from manufacturers 
most of the purchases from the company s primary wholesaler were for brand name pharmaceuticals 
the company believes that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brand name pharmaceuticals are readily available  except to the extent that brand name drugs are available to the market exclusively through the manufacturer 
the company derives a substantial portion of its specialty pharmacy segment revenue from the sale of specialty drugs provided by a limited number of single source biopharmaceutical manufacturers

depreciation is calculated using the straight line method for assets with useful lives as follows buildings  years  machinery  equipment and office furnishings  three to years  and computer software  three to five years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining life of the lease or the useful lives of the assets 
in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  certain costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over three to five years 
costs for general and administrative expenses  overhead  maintenance and training  as well as the cost of software coding that does not add functionality to existing systems  are expensed as incurred 
net revenues 
product net revenues consist principally of sales of prescription drugs to clients and members  either through the company s networks of contractually affiliated retail pharmacies or through the company s mail order pharmacies 
the majority of the company s product net revenues are derived on a fee for service basis 
the company s product net revenues also include revenues from the sale of diabetes supplies by polymedica 
specialty pharmacy product net revenues represent revenues from the sale of primarily biopharmaceutical drugs and are reported at the net amount billed to third party payors and patients 
the company recognizes product revenues when the prescriptions are dispensed through retail pharmacies in the company s networks of contractually affiliated retail pharmacies or the company s mail order pharmacies and received by members and patients 
the company evaluates client contracts using the indicators of emerging issues task force eitf no 
 reporting gross revenue as a principal vs 
net as an agent eitf  to determine whether the company acts as a principal or as an agent in the fulfillment of prescriptions through the retail pharmacy network 
the company acts as a principal in most of its transactions with clients and revenues are recognized at the prescription price ingredient cost plus dispensing fee negotiated with clients  including the portion of the price allocated by the client to be settled directly by the member co payment  as well as the company s administrative fees gross reporting 
gross reporting is appropriate because the company a has separate contractual relationships with clients and with pharmacies  b is responsible to validate and economically manage a claim through its claims adjudication process  c commits to set prescription prices for the pharmacy  including instructing the pharmacy as to how that price is to be settled co payment requirements  d manages the overall prescription drug relationship with the patients  who are members of clients plans  and e has credit risk for the price due from the client 
in limited instances where the company adjudicates prescriptions at pharmacies that are under contract 
table of contents medco health solutions  inc 
notes to consolidated financial statements continued directly with the client and there are no financial risks to the company  such revenue is recorded at the amount of the administrative fee earned by the company for processing the claim net reporting 
the company s product net revenues also include premiums associated with the company s medicare part d pdp risk based product offerings 
these products involve prescription dispensing for beneficiaries enrolled in the cms sponsored medicare part d prescription drug benefit 
the company s two insurance company subsidiaries have been operating under contracts with cms since  and currently offer several medicare pdp options 
the products involve underwriting the benefit  charging enrollees applicable premiums  providing covered prescription drugs and administering the benefit as filed with cms 
the company provides three medicare drug benefit plan options for beneficiaries  including i a standard part d benefit plan as mandated by statute  and ii two benefit plans with enhanced coverage  that exceed the standard part d benefit plan  available for an additional premium 
the company also offers numerous customized benefit plan designs to employer group retiree plans under the cms medicare part d prescription drug benefit 
the pdp premiums are determined based on the company s annual bid and related contractual arrangements with cms 
the pdp premiums are primarily comprised of amounts received from cms as part of a direct subsidy and an additional subsidy from cms for low income member premiums  as well as premium payments received from members 
these premiums are recognized ratably to product net revenues over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits 
premiums received in advance of the applicable benefit period are deferred and recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
there is a possibility that the annual costs of drugs may be higher or lower than premium revenues 
as a result  cms provides a risk corridor adjustment for the standard drug benefit that compares the company s actual annual drug costs incurred to the targeted premiums in the company s cms approved bid 
based on specific collars in the risk corridor  the company will receive from cms additional premium amounts or be required to refund to cms previously received premium amounts 
the company calculates the risk corridor adjustment on a quarterly basis based on drug cost experience to date and records an adjustment to product net revenues with a corresponding account receivable or payable to cms reflected on the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to premiums  there are certain co payments and deductibles the cost share due by members based on prescription orders by those members  some of which are subsidized by cms in cases of low income membership 
for subsidies received in advance  the amount is deferred and recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
if there is cost share due from members or cms  the amount is accrued and recorded in client accounts receivable  net  on the consolidated balance sheets 
after the end of the contract year and based on actual annual drug costs incurred  cost share amounts are reconciled with cms and the corresponding receivable or payable is settled 
the cost share is treated consistently as other co payments derived from providing pbm services  as a component of product net revenues in the consolidated statements of income where the requirements of eitf are met 
premium revenues for the company s pdp products  which exclude member cost share  were million  or less than of total net revenues  in  million  or less than of total net revenues  in  and million  or approximately of total net revenues  in the company s agreements with cms  as well as applicable medicare part d regulations and federal and state laws  require the company to  among other obligations i comply with certain disclosure  filing  record keeping and marketing rules  ii operate quality assurance  drug utilization management and medication therapy management programs  iii support e prescribing initiatives  iv implement grievance  appeals and formulary exception processes  v comply with payment protocols  which include the return of overpayments to cms and  in certain circumstances  coordination with state pharmacy assistance programs  vi use approved networks and formularies  and provide access to such networks to any willing pharmacy  vii provide emergency out of network coverage  and viii adopt a comprehensive medicare and fraud  waste and abuse compliance program

notes to consolidated financial statements continued executing the program are subject to audit  and if material contractual or regulatory non compliance was to be identified  applicable sanctions and or monetary penalties  including suspension of enrollment and marketing  may be imposed 
additionally  each calendar year  payment will vary based on the annual benchmark that applies as a result of medicare part d plan bids for the applicable year  as well as for changes in the cms methodology for calculating risk adjustment factors 
rebates and guarantees regarding the level of service the company will provide to the client or member or the minimum level of rebates or discounts the client will receive are deducted from product net revenues as they are earned by the client 
rebates are generally credited or paid to clients subsequent to collections from pharmaceutical manufacturers  although there are certain instances where rebates are paid to clients on a more accelerated basis 
other contractual payments made to clients are generally made upon initiation of contracts as implementation allowances  which may  for example  be designated by clients as funding for their costs to transition their plans to the company 
the company considers these payments to be an integral part of the company s pricing of a contract and believes that they represent only a variability in the timing of cash flows that does not change the underlying economics of the contract 
accordingly  these payments are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of product net revenues  generally on a straight line basis  over the life of the contract where the payments are refundable upon cancellation of the contract or relate to noncancelable contracts 
amounts capitalized are assessed periodically for recoverability based on the profitability of the contract 
service revenues consist principally of administrative fees and clinical program fees earned from clients and other non product related revenues  sales of prescription services to pharmaceutical manufacturers and data to other parties  and performance oriented fees paid by specialty pharmacy manufacturers 
service revenues are recorded by the company when performance occurs and collectibility is assured 
cost of revenues 
cost of product net revenues includes the cost of inventory dispensed from the mail order pharmacies  along with direct dispensing costs and associated depreciation 
cost of product net revenues also includes ingredient costs of drugs dispensed by and professional fees paid to retail network pharmacies 
in addition  cost of product net revenues includes the operating costs of the company s call center pharmacies  which primarily respond to member and retail pharmacist inquiries regarding member prescriptions  as well as physician calls 
cost of product net revenues also includes an offsetting credit for rebates earned from pharmaceutical manufacturers whose drugs are included on the company s preferred drug lists  which are also known as formularies 
rebates receivable from pharmaceutical manufacturers are accrued in the period earned by multiplying estimated rebatable prescription drugs dispensed through the company s retail networks and through the company s mail order pharmacies by the contractually agreed manufacturer rebate amount 
rebates receivable estimates are revised to actual  with the difference recorded to cost of revenues  upon billing to the manufacturer  generally to days subsequent to the end of the applicable quarter 
these bills are not issued until the necessary specific eligible claims and third party market share data are received and thoroughly analyzed 
historically  the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized and recorded to actual amounts billed has not been material to the company s results of operations 
the company s cost of product net revenues also includes the cost of drugs dispensed by the company s mail order pharmacies or retail networks for members covered under the company s medicare part d pdp product offerings and are recorded at cost as incurred 
the company receives a catastrophic reinsurance subsidy from cms for approximately of costs incurred by individual members in excess of the individual annual out of pocket maximum of  million for coverage year   million for coverage year and  for coverage year the subsidy is reflected as an offsetting credit in cost of product net revenues to the extent that catastrophic costs are incurred 
catastrophic reinsurance subsidy amounts received in advance are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
if there are catastrophic reinsurance subsidies due from cms  the amount is recorded in client accounts

goodwill 
goodwill of  million at december  and  million at december  represents  for the pbm segment  the push down of the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the company s net assets from the acquisition of the company by merck in  and  to a significantly lesser extent  the company s acquisition of a majority interest in europa apotheek in  and the acquisitions of polymedica in and provantage health services  inc provantage in goodwill also includes  for the specialty pharmacy segment  a portion of the excess of the purchase price the company paid to acquire accredo health  incorporated accredo over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired  as well as  to a significantly lesser extent  the company s acquisition of critical care systems  inc critical care in  and the acquisition of selected assets of pediatric services of america  inc pediatric services in see note  acquisitions of businesses  for more information on the acquisition of a majority interest in europa apotheek  and the polymedica and critical care acquisitions 
the company s goodwill balance is assessed for impairment annually using a two step fair value based test or whenever events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  by comparing the fair value of each segment s reporting units to the carrying value of the assets and liabilities assigned to each reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit were to exceed the company s estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit  the company would then be required to estimate the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities within the reporting unit for purposes of calculating the fair value of goodwill 
the company would be required to record an impairment charge to the extent recorded goodwill exceeds the fair value amount of goodwill resulting from this allocation

the company continues to believe that its business practices comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations and is vigorously defending itself in the actions described below 
the company believes that most of the claims made in these legal proceedings and government investigations would not likely be covered by insurance 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  the company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management

rule b sales plans 
medco s comprehensive compliance program includes a broad policy against insider trading 
the procedures promulgated under that policy include regularly scheduled blackout periods that apply to over employees 
executive officers are prohibited from trading during the period that begins on the first day of the last month of the fiscal period and ends on the third trading day after the release of earnings 
in addition  executive officers are required to pre clear all of their trades 
medco s executive officers are also subject to share ownership guidelines and retention requirements 
the ownership targets are based on a multiple of salary  or times salary  but are expressed as a number of shares 
the targets are determined using base salary and the closing price of our stock on the date of our annual meeting of shareholders 
the number of shares required to be held has been calculated using a stock price  the closing price of our stock on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders 

table of contents to facilitate compliance with the ownership guidelines and retention requirements  medco s board of directors authorized the use of prearranged trading plans under rule b of the securities exchange act of rule b permits insiders to adopt predetermined plans for selling specified amounts of stock or exercising stock options under specified conditions and at specified times 
executive officers may only enter into a trading plan during an open trading window and they must not possess material nonpublic information regarding the company at the time they adopt the plan 
using trading plans  insiders can diversify their investment portfolios while avoiding concerns about transactions occurring at a time when they might possess material nonpublic information 
under medco s policy  sales instructions made pursuant to a written trading plan may be executed during a blackout period 
in addition  the use of trading plans provides medco with a greater ability to monitor trading and compliance with its stock ownership guidelines 
generally  under these trading plans  the individual relinquishes control over the transactions once the trading plan is put into place 
accordingly  sales under these plans may occur at any time  including possibly before  simultaneously with  or immediately after significant events involving our company 
all trading plans adopted by medco executives are reviewed and approved by the office of the general counsel 
for ease of administration  executives have been permitted to add new orders to existing plans rather than requiring the adoption of a new plan 
once modified  a plan cannot be changed for at least days 
both new plans and modifications are subject to a mandatory waiting period designed to safeguard the plans from manipulation or market timing
