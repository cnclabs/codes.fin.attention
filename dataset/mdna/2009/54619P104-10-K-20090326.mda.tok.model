item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview louisiana bancorp  inc is a louisiana corporation that became the holding company for bank of new orleans in connection with the conversion of the bank in july from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank 
bank of new orleans is a community oriented savings bank headquartered in metairie  louisiana 
we currently operate three banking offices in jefferson and orleans parishes  and a loan production office located in hammond  louisiana 
our fourth banking office has been temporarily closed since hurricane katrina in august our primary business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and using those funds together with funds we borrow to originate loans to our customers and invest in mortgage backed and other securities 
at december   we had total assets of million  including million in net loans and million of mortgage backed and other securities  total deposits of million and shareholders equity of million 
historically  we have operated as a traditional thrift relying almost exclusively on long term  fixed rate single family residential mortgage loans to generate interest income 
approximately six years ago  we determined to revise our lending strategy in order to increase our originations of multi family residential  commercial real estate and land loans 
our results of operations depend  to a large extent  on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on our loan and investment portfolios and interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
our net interest income is largely determined by our net interest spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
results of operations are also affected by our provisions for loan losses  fee income and other non interest income and non interest expense 
non interest expense principally consists of compensation and employee benefits  office occupancy and equipment expense  data processing  advertising and business promotion and other expense 
we expect that our non interest expenses will increase as we continue to grow and expand our operations 
in addition  our salaries and benefits expense have increased due to the new stock benefit plans that we have implemented following the conversion to the stock form 
our results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may materially impact our financial conditions and results of operations 
business strategy our business strategy is focused on operating a growing and profitable community oriented financial institution 
below are certain highlights of our business strategy growing our loan portfolio 
we expect to be more aggressive in our efforts to originate new loans in accordance with our policies 
we also intend to be more aggressive in purchasing loans or participation interests in loans that meet our underwriting standards 
in doing so  we have purchased loans originated outside our market area which meet our underwriting standards 
in addition to facilitating loan growth  such purchases may lessen the geographic concentration of our loans 
expanding our market area 
we intend to pursue opportunities to expand our market area by opening additional banking offices 
during  we opened a loan production office in hammond  louisiana  which is located on the northwest shore of lake pontchartrain 
we may consider opening additional loan production offices  and acquisitions of other financial institutions although we have no current plans  understandings or agreements with respect to any specific acquisitions 
we expect to focus our expansion efforts on contiguous markets to the west of jefferson parish and on the north shore of lake pontchartrain 
in addition  we may consider nearby markets in southern and coastal mississippi 
maintaining high asset quality 
even with the effects of hurricane katrina  we continue to maintain exceptional levels of asset quality 
at december   our non performing loans amounted to 
table of contents  or of total assets 
we attribute our high asset quality to our prudent and conservative underwriting practices  and we intend to maintain high asset quality after the offering even as we grow the bank 
continuing to provide exceptional customer service 
as a community oriented savings bank  we take pride in providing exceptional customer service as a means to attract and retain customers 
we deliver personalized service to our customers that distinguishes us from the large regional banks operating in our market area 
our management team has strong ties to  and deep roots in  the community 
we believe that we know our customers banking needs and can respond quickly to address them 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements and other sections contained in this report 
critical accounting policies in reviewing and understanding financial information for louisiana bancorp  you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing our financial statements 
these policies are described in note a of the notes to our financial statements  which are included in item of this annual report on form k 
the accounting and financial reporting policies of louisiana bancorp conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and to general practices within the banking industry 
accordingly  the financial statements require certain estimates  judgments  and assumptions  which are believed to be reasonable  based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented 
the following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
these policies require numerous estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations which may significantly affect our reported results and financial condition for the period or in future periods 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
the allowance is an amount that represents the amount of probable and reasonably estimable known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio  based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the types and amount of loans in the loan portfolio  historical loss experience  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  estimated losses relating to specifically identified loans  and current economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including  among others  exposure at default  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impacted loans  value of collateral  estimated losses on our commercial and residential loan portfolios and general amounts for historical loss experience 
all of these estimates may be susceptible to significant change 
while management uses the best information available to make loan loss allowance evaluations  adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions or changes in accounting guidance 
historically  our estimates of the allowance for loan loss have not required significant adjustments from management s initial estimates 
in addition  the office of thrift supervision  as an integral part of its examination processes  periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses 
the office of thrift supervision may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from management s estimates  additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
income taxes 
we make estimates and judgments to calculate some of our tax liabilities and determine the recoverability of some of our deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses 
we also estimate a reserve for deferred tax assets if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax 
table of contents assets will not be realized in future periods 
these estimates and judgments are inherently subjective 
historically  our estimates and judgments to calculate our deferred tax accounts have not required significant revision to our initial estimates 
in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  recent cumulative losses and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we make assumptions for the amount of taxable income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require us to make judgments about our future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
how we manage market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from the interest rate risk which is inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages interest rate risk exposure 
in addition to market risk  our primary risk is credit risk on our loan portfolio 
we attempt to manage credit risk through our loan underwriting and oversight policies 
the principal objective of our interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk embedded in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given our business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with approved guidelines 
we seek to manage our exposure to risks from changes in interest rates while at the same time trying to improve our net interest spread 
we monitor interest rate risk as such risk relates to our operating strategies 
we have established an asset liability committee alco investment committee  which is comprised of our president and chief executive officer  chief financial officer  controller and two outside directors  and which is responsible for reviewing our asset liability and investment policies and interest rate risk position 
the alco investment committee meets on a regular basis 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on future earnings 
in recent years  we primarily have utilized the following strategies in our efforts to manage interest rate risk we have increased our originations of shorter term loans particularly multi family residential  commercial real estate and land loans  we have attempted to match fund a portion of our loan portfolio with borrowings having similar expected lives  on occasion  we have sold long term year fixed rate mortgage loans which had been classified as held for sale  we have attempted  where possible  to extend the maturities of our deposits and borrowings  and we have invested in securities with relatively short anticipated lives  generally three to five years  and we hold significant amounts of liquid assets 
gap analysis 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset and liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to affect adversely net interest income while a positive 
table of contents gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to affect adversely net interest income 
our one year cumulative gap was a positive at december  the following table sets forth the amounts of the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which we expect  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown the gap table 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities of the bank at december   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
the loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and anticipated prepayments of adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans  and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans 
annual prepayment rates for single family and other mortgage loans are assumed to range from to 
the annual prepayment rate for mortgage backed securities is assumed to range from to months or less more than months to months more than months to year more than year to years more than years to years more than years total amount dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable investment securities mortgage backed securities other interest earning assets total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities passbook accounts checking accounts money market accounts certificate accounts borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest earning assets less interest bearing liabilities cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate gap as a percentage of total assets at december  cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of cumulative interest bearing liabilities at december  interest earning assets are included in the period in which the balances are expected to be redeployed and or repriced as a result of anticipated prepayments  scheduled rate adjustments and contractual maturities 

table of contents for purposes of the gap analysis  loans receivable includes non performing loans gross of the allowance for loan losses  undisbursed loan funds  unamortized discounts and deferred loan fees 
interest rate sensitivity gap represents the difference between net interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
net portfolio value and net interest income analysis 
our interest rate sensitivity also is monitored by management through the use of models which generate estimates of the change in its net portfolio value npv and net interest income nii over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the following table sets forth our npv as of december  and reflects the changes to npv as a result of immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as indicated 
change in interest rates in basis points rate shock net portfolio value npv as of portfolio value of assets amount change change npv ratio change dollars in thousands bp static in addition to modeling changes in npv  we also analyze potential changes to nii for a twelve month period under rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the following table shows our nii model as of december  change in interest rates in basis points rate shock net interest income change change dollars in thousands bp static the above table indicates that as of december   in the event of an immediate and sustained basis point increase in interest rates  our net interest income for the months ending december  would be expected to increase by  or to million 
as is the case with the gap table  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv and nii require the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to 
table of contents maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results 
average balances  net interest income  and yields earned and rates paid 
the following table shows for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest from average interest earning assets and the resulting yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates  and the net interest margin 
tax exempt income and yields have not been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis 
all average balances are based on monthly balances 
management does not believe that the monthly averages differ significantly from what the daily averages would be 
year ended december  average balance interest average yield rate average balance interest average yield rate average balance interest average yield rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable mortgage backed securities investment securities other interest earning assets total interest earning assets non interest earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities passbook  checking and money market accounts certificate accounts total deposits borrowings total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity net interest earning assets net interest income  average interest rate spread net interest margin average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities includes nonaccrual loans during the respective periods 
calculated net of deferred fees and discounts and allowance for loan losses 
equals net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis 
the following table shows the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities affected our interest income and expense during the periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to changes in rate  which is the change in rate multiplied by 
table of contents prior year volume  and changes in volume  which is the change in volume multiplied by prior year rate 
the combined effect of changes in both rate and volume has been allocated proportionately to the change due to rate and the change due to volume

the increase in our securities portfolio was funded primarily by wholesale funding sources consisting of federal home loan bank advances and reverse repurchase agreements 
our net loans receivable increased during the year ended december  by million 
loans secured by single family residences increased by million  and loans secured by commercial real estate increased by million 
originations of loans secured by one to four family residences were million during  an increase of million from originations of multi family residential  commercial real estate and land loans were million and million in and  respectively 
during  we purchased million in loans comprised of  in single family residential loans and million in commercial real estate loans 
total deposits grew during the year ended december  by million  with million of the growth occurring during the fourth quarter 
certificates of deposit were million at december   an increase of million from the prior year end  while total transaction accounts were million  a decrease of million 
in management s opinion  this net growth in total deposits is primarily attributable to the current volatility in the worldwide financial markets  which has created an inflow of deposits into conservative  highly capitalized financial institutions  like ours 
management expects that the majority of these recently deposited funds will return to the equity markets when the volatility in the financial markets dissipates 
total borrowings increased during by million  with total fhlb advances growing by million and reverse repurchase agreements increasing by million 
this increase in total borrowings provided funding for the increase in mortgage backed securities  referenced previously 

table of contents total shareholders equity amounted to million at december   or of total assets 
shareholders equity was million less at december  compared to december   due primarily to repurchases of shares of our common stock for the company s recognition and retention plan at a cost of million  and repurchases of shares for treasury at a cost of million pursuant to the company s stock repurchase programs 
net income during the year was million and other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income taxes  was million 
the remaining change in shareholders equity was due to the release of esop shares at a cost of  and credits of  to additional paid in capital to recognize the appreciation in the esop shares and the market value of the stock options granted during the year 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general 
for the year ended december   the company reported net income of million  an increase of  from the year ended december  the increase in net income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income of million resulting primarily from higher average balances of interest earning assets following the company s initial public offering in july  and the wholesale leverage strategies implemented during the impact of the increase in net interest income was partially offset by higher levels of non interest expense related to our employee stock ownership plan esop and our other equity based compensation plans 
interest income 
for the year ended december   interest income was million  an increase of million from the year ended december  during  interest income on loans increased by  due to an increase in the average balance of loans receivable of million 
interest income on mortgage backed securities increased by million in compared to due to an increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities of million and an increase in average yield of basis points 
during  interest income on investment securities increased by  due to an increase in average balance of million  despite a decrease in average yield of basis points 
interest on other interest earning assets declined by  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due to a reduction in average balance of million 
interest expense 
for the year ended december   total interest expense increased by  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  total average interest bearing deposits decreased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest paid on deposits declined by  due to the decline in average deposit balance and a reduction in average interest paid of 
interest expense on total borrowings was million for the year ended december   an increase of  from the year ended december  the average balance of our total borrowings increased by million during  as the bank increased the leverage in its balance sheet to acquire additional mortgage backed securities 
the average interest rate paid on our borrowings was during  a decline of basis points from the prior year 
provision for loan losses 
we have identified the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses as a critical accounting policy where amounts are sensitive to material variation 
this policy is significantly affected by our judgment and uncertainties and there is a likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different  but reasonably plausible  conditions or assumptions 
our activity in the provision for loan losses  which are charges or recoveries to operating results  is undertaken in order to maintain a level of total allowance for losses that management believes covers all known and inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable at each reporting date 
our evaluation process typically includes  among other things  an analysis of delinquency trends  non performing loan trends  the level of charge offs and recoveries  prior loss experience  total loans outstanding  the volume of loan originations  the type  size and geographic concentration of our loans  the value of collateral securing the loan  the borrower s ability to repay and repayment performance  the number of loans requiring heightened management oversight  local economic conditions and industry experience 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to make additional provisions for estimated loan losses based upon judgments different from those of management 

table of contents the bank recorded net recoveries on its allowance for loan losses of  and  respectively  for the years ended december  and the recoveries in both and are reversals of provisions for loan losses made in prior years on loans secured by properties damaged by hurricane katrina in that have been subsequently paid off by the borrowers in the respective periods during which the recoveries were recorded 
these recoveries are net of the loan loss provisions established during the respective periods 
our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans receivable was at december   a decline of basis points from december  our allowance for loan losses at december  amounted to of our non performing loans 
management believes that the company s allowance for loan losses at december  represents its best estimate of probable losses that existed on that date 
non interest income 
non interest income for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
customer service fees were  for  an increase of  from the prior year 
included in customer service fees are commissions earned on reverse mortgage loan originations  which increased by  during other non interest income was  for  a decrease of  from non interest expense 
for the years ended december  and  non interest expense was million and million  respectively 
salary and benefit expenses increased by million and other non interest expense increased by  during the year ending december   over the increased level of salaries and benefits expense for was due to an increase of  in salaries and wages  a  increase in benefit plan expenses  and  in expense from our new equity based compensation plans 
our equity based compensation plans were approved by our shareholders in february  and therefore was a new component of non interest expense in the increase in other noninterest expense during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due primarily to the louisiana bank shares tax and the louisiana corporate franchise tax  which were not applicable prior to our mutual to stock conversion and initial public offering 
the louisiana bank shares tax was  and the louisiana corporate franchise tax was  for the year ended december  the remaining increase in other non interest expense was due to increased public reporting expenditures and higher levels of professional fees due to our status as a publicly traded company for the entire year in income tax expense 
income tax expense for the year ended december  amounted to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in income tax expense during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due to the  increase in pre tax income between the periods  as well as an adjustment to our deferred tax liability of  in the fourth quarter of  which lowered our effective tax rate 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general 
the company s net income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  or from the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in our net income for was an increase in net interest income of  the growth in net interest income in compared to was due to an increase in average net interest earning assets of million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the growth in average net interest earning assets was the result of the deployment of million in net proceeds derived from our initial public offering that closed in july the increase in our net interest income was partially offset by a reduction in the amount of recoveries from our allowance for loan losses during compared to for the year ended december   the amount of our recoveries from the allowance for loan losses was  compared to  for the year ended december  the majority of these recoveries relate to provisions for loan losses established immediately following hurricane katrina on properties that were substantially impaired 
interest income 
our total interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or from the prior twelve month period 
during  interest earned on our loan 
table of contents portfolio increased by  interest on investment securities increased by  and interest on other earning assets increased by  compared to the respective amounts in the increase in interest earned on our loan portfolio was due primarily to a million increase in the average balance of loans receivable during the period  as well as a basis point increase in the average yield on the loan portfolio 
the growth in our loan portfolio has been primarily in the multi family residential and commercial real estate sector 
the increases in interest income on our investment securities and other earning assets  which includes cash and cash equivalents  was the result of an aggregate increase of million in average balances of these categories 
these categories experienced increases in their respective balances following the closing of the company s initial public offering in july interest expense 
our total interest expense amounted to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense on deposits was million  an increase of  or from the previous year 
this change in interest expense on deposits was due to an increase in the average cost of deposits of basis points in compared to the primary reason for the increase in the average cost of our deposits in was the renewal of older  lower costing deposits at the prevailing market rates during the year 
interest expense on borrowings was million for the year ended december   a decrease of  from the year ended december  this decline in interest expense on borrowings was the result of a decrease in the average balance of borrowings of million during compared to the average balance of our borrowings for the years ended december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
provision for loan losses 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a recovery from the allowance for loan losses in the amount of  this is a decrease in the level of recoveries of  from the year ended december  the recoveries in both and are attributed to provisions for loan losses established in following hurricane katrina 
the company s provision for loan losses was million in based on management s assessment  relying on the information available at that time  of the level of loan losses in our loan portfolio 
of this million provision established in   was recorded specifically against an aggregate of million of loans  with the remainder of the provision unallocated and applied to the general allowance for loan losses 
during and  the recoveries from our allowance for loan losses were primarily due to the repayment of principal on the million of loans specifically identified in non interest income 
non interest income for the year ended december  was  a decrease of approximately  from the year ended december  customer service fees for were  a decrease of  from the prior month period 
other non interest income for was  an increase of  from the year ended december  non interest expense 
total non interest expense was million for both the years ended december  and december  salaries and employee benefit costs were million for both years  as well 
occupancy expense during was million  an increase of  from the previous month period 
during and  the company reported losses on sales of available for sale securities of  and  respectively 
these losses were offset by additional interest income recognized on the reinvestment of the sale proceeds 
other non interest expenses were  for the year ended december   a decrease of  from the year ended december  income tax expense 
our income tax expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase in income taxes was due primarily to the increase in pre tax income of  during the period 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  compared to an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are from deposits  amortization of loans  loan prepayments and the maturity of loans  mortgage backed securities and other investments  and other funds provided from operations 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities and maturing investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments can be greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we also maintain excess funds in short term  interest bearing assets that provide additional liquidity 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents amounted to million 
in addition  at such date our available for sale investment and mortgage backed securities amounted to an aggregate of million 
we use our liquidity to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund maturing certificates of deposit and demand deposit withdrawals  to invest in other interest earning assets  and to meet operating expenses 
at december   we had certificates of deposit maturing within the next months amounting to million 
based upon historical experience  we anticipate that a significant portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be redeposited with us 
for the year ended december   the average balance of our outstanding fhlb advances and other borrowings was million 
at december   we had million in outstanding fhlb advances and we had million in additional fhlb advances available to us 
in addition to cash flow from loan and securities payments and prepayments as well as from sales of available for sale securities  we have significant borrowing capacity available to fund liquidity needs 
in recent years we have utilized borrowings as a cost efficient addition to deposits as a source of funds 
our borrowings consist primarily of advances from the federal home loan bank of dallas  of which we are a member 
under terms of the collateral agreement with the federal home loan bank  we pledge residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities as well as our stock in the federal home loan bank as collateral for such advances 
we also access funds through reverse repurchase agreements with commercial banks 
these borrowings are typically used to fund purchases of mortgage backed securities at terms more favorable than those available through the federal home loan bank 
our borrowings from reverse repurchase agreements amounted to million at december  furthermore  we have the ability to borrow from the federal reserve bank discount window on an overnight or other short term basis 
borrowings from the federal reserve discount window are typically collateralized us government or agency issued investment or mortgage backed securities 
commitments the following table summarizes our outstanding commitments to originate loans and to advance additional amounts pursuant to outstanding letters of credit  lines of credit and undisbursed construction loans at december  total amounts committed amount of commitment expiration per period to year over to years over to years after years in thousands letters of credit lines of credit undisbursed portion of loans in process commitments to originate loans total commitments 
table of contents contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at december  total payments due by period to year over to years over to years after years in thousands certificates of deposit fhlb advances and other borrowings total long term debt operating lease obligations total contractual obligations we anticipate that we will continue to have sufficient funds and alternative funding sources to meet our current commitments 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements  accompanying notes  and related financial data of louisiana bancorp presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
most of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  therefore  the impact of interest rates has a greater impact on its performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
