item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
see risk factors elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a discussion of important factors and risks associated with our business that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers  acquisitions  or divestitures of business combinations that may be announced after the date hereof 
we develop and market a comprehensive suite of e commerce software products  as well as provide related services in conjunction with our products  including support and maintenance  professional services  managed application hosting services  and e commerce optimization services for enhancing online sales and support 
we primarily derive revenue from the sale of software products and related services 
our software licenses are priced based on the size of the customer implementation 
our recurring services revenue is comprised of managed application hosting services  e commerce optimization services  and support and maintenance services 
managed application hosting revenue is recognized monthly as the services are provided based on a per transaction  per cpu or percent of customer s revenue basis 
e commerce optimization services are priced on a per transaction basis and recognized monthly as the services are provided 
support and maintenance arrangements are priced based on the level of support services provided as a percent of net license fees per annum 
under support and maintenance services  customers are generally entitled to receive software upgrades and updates  maintenance releases and technical support 
professional and education services revenue includes implementation  technical consulting and education training 
we bill professional service fees primarily on a time and materials basis 
education services are billed as services are provided 
shift to increasing ratably recognized revenue before  most of our revenue from arrangements involving the sale of our software was derived from perpetual software licenses and in most circumstances was recognized at the time the license agreement was executed and the software was delivered 
beginning in the first quarter of  an increasing number of our perpetual software license arrangements have also included the sale of our managed application hosting services or e commerce optimization services 
as a result of applying the requirements of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to our evolving business model  the revenue from these arrangements is recognized on a ratable basis over the estimated term of the contract or arrangement  commencing with the go live date for providing the managed application hosting services or e commerce optimization services 
the addition of e commerce optimization services and managed application hosting services solution offerings introduced new products in our portfolio for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe of fair value 
as a result  when we sell e commerce optimization services and managed application hosting services in conjunction with e commerce software  we defer all up front fees  such as those for licenses  support and maintenance and professional services  received prior to the delivery of the managed application hosting services or e commerce optimization services 
we recognize revenue from these fees ratably over either the term of the contract or estimated life of the arrangement depending on the specific facts of the arrangement  commencing with the go live date for providing the managed application hosting services or e commerce optimization services 
in addition  when professional services revenue is deferred in connection with these arrangements and other instances in which there are undelivered elements to a transaction for which we do not have vsoe of fair value  we defer the direct costs related to performing the professional services prior to delivery of the element related to these services 
these amounts are recognized ratably to cost of revenue in the same manner as the related revenue 
key measures that we use to evaluate our performance the change to our business model has required our management to re consider the measures that we use to evaluate our business results 
in addition to the traditional measures of financial performance that are reflected in 
table of contents our results of operations determined in accordance with gaap  we also monitor certain non gaap financial measures related to the performance of our business 
a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s historical or future financial performance that excludes amounts that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in the gaap statement of operations 
among the gaap and non gaap measures that we believe are most important in evaluating the performance of our business are the following we use product license bookings  a non gaap financial measure  as an important measure of growth in demand for our atg e commerce platform and the success of our sales and marketing efforts 
we define product license bookings as product license revenue as reported under gaap plus the contract value of licenses executed and whose recognition was deferred in the current period less revenue that was recognized from license contracts executed and deferred in prior periods 
when considering the contract value of licenses executed during the period we use our judgment in assessing collectability and likelihood of granting future concessions 
factors that we consider include the financial condition of the customer and contractual provisions included in the contract 
we believe that this measure provides us with an indication of the amount of new software license business that our direct sales team has added in the period 
product license revenue associated with a particular transaction may be deferred for reasons other than the presence of a managed application hosting or e commerce optimization services arrangement  such as the presence of credit risk or other contractual terms that  under gaap  require us to defer the recognition of revenue 
the deferred revenue for such a transaction may be recognized in a single future period when the conditions that originally required deferral have been resolved  rather than ratably 
we include all additions to deferred product license revenue in our calculation of product license bookings 
we use cash flow from operations as an indicator of the success of the business 
because a portion of our revenue is deferred in the near term  our net income may be significantly different from the cash that we generate from operations 
we use recurring services revenue  as reported under gaap  to evaluate the success of our strategy to deliver site independent online services and the growth of our recurring revenue sources 
recurring services revenue includes e commerce optimization services  application hosting services and support and maintenance related to atg e commerce platform sales 
we use revenue and gross margins on our various lines of business to measure our success at meeting cash and non cash cost and expense targets in relation to revenue earned 
we use days sales outstanding dso  calculated by dividing accounts receivable at period end by revenue and multiplying the result by the number of days in the period 
we also use a modified dso that adjusts our revenue by the change in deferred revenue during the period to provide us with a more accurate picture of the strength of our accounts receivables and related collection efforts 
the percentage of accounts receivable that are less than days old is an important factor that our management uses to understand the strength of our accounts receivable portfolio 
this measure is important because a disproportionate percentage of our product license bookings often occurs late in the quarter  which has the effect of increasing our dso and modified dso 
trends in on line sales and our business set forth below is a discussion of recent developments in our industry that we believe offer us significant opportunities  present us with significant challenges  and have the potential to significantly influence our results of operations 
impact of weakening economy 
the global recession that currently is affecting all sectors of the us and most foreign economies creates substantial uncertainty for our business 
weakening economic conditions have led to delays or reductions in capital spending  including purchases of information technology across industries and markets  and some customers in markets that we serve  such as luxury retailers  have been particularly affected 
we cannot accurately predict the duration or severity of the current adverse economic conditions or their impact on our customers demand for our products and services 
as a result  it is difficult for us to reliably forecast our longer term 
table of contents revenues or results of operations  and we have recently announced that until macro economic conditions have stabilized  we will no longer provide annual guidance 
instead  we will only issue forward looking information about our expected operating results on a quarter by quarter basis 
also  in light of these uncertainties  we are monitoring our operating expenses closely and have implemented expense control measures  including constraints on new hiring and discretionary spending 
trend in on line sales 
the growth of e commerce as an important sales channel is the principal driver for demand for our products and services 
we believe that in the current environment  the on line channel is growing in importance for many of our customers  as e commerce may offer more opportunities for revenue growth as well as significant cost savings and operational benefits such as improved inventory control and purchasing processes compared with retailers bricks and mortar operations 
e commerce replatforming 
enterprises periodically upgrade or replace the network and enterprise applications software and the related hardware systems that they use to run their e commerce operations in order to take advantage of advances in computing power  system architectures and enterprise software functionality that enable them to increase the capabilities of their e commerce systems while simplifying operation and maintenance of these systems and reducing their cost of ownership 
in the e commerce software industry  we refer to these major system upgrades or replacements as replatforming 
we believe that on average  customers in our market replatform or refresh their e commerce software approximately every five years 
as a result of these factors  we have experienced a period of increased replatforming activity over the last several years  with increased corporate spending on e commerce optimization services across many of our markets 
the extent to which this trend will continue in light of current adverse economic conditions is unknown 
however  we are cautiously optimistic that in the near term spending on e commerce technology will continue at levels comparable to those we have recently experienced  and that it may even increase as a priority for some of our customers and prospects  due to the growing importance and cost benefits of the on line channel 
emergence of the on demand model of software as a service 
an important trend throughout the enterprise software industry in recent years has been the emergence of software as a service  or saas 
saas is a software delivery model whereby a software vendor that has developed a software application hosts and operates it for use by its customers over the internet 
the emergence of saas has been driven by customers desire to reduce the costs of owning and operating critical applications software  while shifting the risks and burdens associated with operating and maintaining the software to the software vendor  enabling the customer to focus its resources on its core business 
rapidly evolving and increasingly complex customer requirements 
the market for e commerce is constantly and rapidly evolving  as we and our competitors introduce new and enhanced products  retire older ones  and react to changes in internet related technology and customer demands 
the market for e commerce has seen diminishing product differentiators  increasing product commoditization and evolving industry standards 
to succeed  we need to enhance our current products and develop new products on a timely basis to keep pace with market needs  satisfy the increasingly sophisticated requirements of customers and leverage strategic alliances with third parties in the e commerce field who have complementary products 
international expansion 
revenues derived from foreign sales as a percentage of our total revenues declined to in from in this decrease is attributable in part to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in the second half of  the value of the us dollar usd increased compared to the british pound gbp and the euro  which are the two currencies in which the majority of our foreign sales arise 
continued strength of the usd in relation to the gbp and euro in could result in lower foreign revenue in we seek to invest resources into further developing our reach internationally 
in support of this initiative we have entered into partnership agreements abroad that will support our continued growth 
as the international market opportunity continues to develop we will adjust our strategy 
competitive trend 
the market for online sales  marketing and customer service software is intensely competitive  subject to rapid technological change  and significantly affected by new product introductions by large competitors with significantly greater resources and installed customer bases 
we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future 

table of contents virtualization 
the trend towards virtualization could challenge our current software license pricing structure 
virtualization is an approach to computing wherein the actual  physical hardware resources of a computer system are configured to simulate the operations of one or more abstract computers  known as virtual machines  on which software can be executed 
the introduction of virtualization technologies may lead us to consider alternative pricing strategies 
development of atg s partner ecosystem 
as we train and develop our atg partner ecosystem we will see a larger number of implementations outsourced to these partners resulting in stable or potentially lower  professional services revenue 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
however  an increasing percent of our sales are influenced by our partner ecosystem 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  deferral of costs  the allowance for accounts receivable  software development costs  the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  income taxes and assumptions for stock based compensation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  known trends or events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we define our critical accounting policies as those that require us to make subjective estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations or that concern the specific manner in which we apply gaap 
our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 
we believe the following critical accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
revenue recognition we generate revenue through the sale of perpetual software licenses  recurring services  which are comprised of support and maintenance services  application hosting services and e commerce optimization services  and professional and education services 
please refer to the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for a more comprehensive discussion of our revenue recognition policy 
our policy is to recognize revenue when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met  which generally include the following persuasive evidence of an arrangement we use a legally binding contract signed by the customer as evidence of an arrangement 
we consider the signed contract to be the most persuasive evidence of the arrangement 
delivery has occurred or services rendered software and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers electronically 
electronic delivery occurs when we provide the customer access to the software 
our software license agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance 
our e commerce optimization services and application hosting services are delivered on a monthly basis 
professional services are generally delivered on a time and material basis 
fee is fixed or determinable we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement  primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we have established a 
table of contents history of collecting under the terms of the original contract without providing concessions on payments  products or services 
our standard payment terms are primarily net days 
significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is fixed or determinable 
we must also make judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment constitutes a concession 
our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable 
while we do not expect that experience to change  if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract terms without providing concessions on licenses  revenue from licenses would be required to be recognized when cash is received 
such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 
collection is probable we assess the probability of collection from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors  including the customer s payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable  we do not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed  which generally means revenue is recognized upon our receipt of the cash payment 
our experience has been that we are generally able to estimate whether collection is probable 
while we do not expect that experience to change  if we were to determine that collection is not probable for any arrangement  revenue from the elements of an arrangement would be recognized upon the receipt of cash payment unless other revenue recognition criteria are not met 
such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 
generally we enter into arrangements that include multiple elements 
such arrangements may include sales of software licenses and related support and maintenance services in conjunction with application hosting services  e commerce optimization services or professional services 
in these situations we must determine whether the various elements meet the applicable criteria to be accounted for as separate elements 
if the elements cannot be separated  revenue is recognized once the revenue recognition criteria for the entire arrangement have been met or over the period that our obligations to the customer are fulfilled  as appropriate 
if the elements are determined to be separable  revenue is allocated to the separate elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value and recognized separately for each element when the applicable revenue recognition criteria for each element have been met 
in accounting for these multiple element arrangements  we must make determinations about whether elements can be accounted for separately and make estimates regarding their relative fair values 
recording revenue from arrangements that include application hosting services requires us to estimate the estimated life of the customer arrangement 
pursuant to the application of relevant gaap literature  eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  our arrangements with application hosting services are accounted for as one unit of accounting 
in such situations  we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the term of the estimated life of the customer arrangement 
based on our historical experience with our customers  we estimate the life of the typical customer arrangement to be approximately four years 
our vsoe of fair value for certain elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in comparable transactions when the element is sold separately 
vsoe of fair value for support and maintenance is based upon our history of charging our customers stated annual renewal rates 
vsoe of fair value for professional services and education is based on the price charged when the services are sold separately 
annually  we evaluate whether or not we have maintained vsoe of fair value for support and maintenance services and professional services 
we have concluded that we have maintained vsoe of fair value for both support and maintenance services and professional services because the majority of our support and maintenance contract renewal rates and professional service rates per personnel level fall in a narrow range of variability within each service offering 
for multiple element arrangements  vsoe of fair value must exist to allocate the total arrangement fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of a perpetual license arrangement 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement  revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements  or until all elements are delivered  whichever is earlier 
if vsoe of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but vsoe of fair value does not exist for one or more delivered elements  revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred  and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue as the elements are delivered 

table of contents in certain instances  we sell perpetual software licenses with application hosting services and e commerce optimization services 
we do not have vsoe of fair value for either of these services 
in these situations all elements in the arrangement for which we receive up front fees  which typically include perpetual software fees  support and maintenance fees and set up and implementation fees  are recognized as revenue ratably over the period of providing the application hosting service or e commerce optimization services 
we allocate and classify revenue in our statement of operations based on our evaluation of vsoe of fair value  or a proxy of fair value thereof  available for each applicable element of the transaction 
we generally base our proxy of fair value on arms length negotiations for the contracted elements 
this allocation methodology requires judgment and is based on our analysis of our sales transactions 
allowances for accounts receivable we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we perform credit reviews of each customer  monitor collections and payments from our customers and determine the allowance based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
in addition  we record allowances to revenue based on past credit memo history in the professional services business 
research and development costs we account for research and development costs for our software products that we license to our customers in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  and sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  which specifies that costs incurred internally to develop computer software products should be charged to expense as incurred until technological feasibility is reached for the product 
once technological feasibility is reached  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is made available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility is established 
we believe that the time period from reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release is very short 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is reached are not material  and accordingly  all such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
costs incurred to develop software applications used in our e commerce optimization services are accounted for in accordance with aicpa statement of position  accounting for computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
capitalizable costs consist of a certain external direct costs of materials and services incurred in developing or obtaining internal use computer software and b payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with  and who devote time to  the project 
these costs generally consist of internal labor during configuration  coding and testing activities 
research and development costs incurred during the preliminary project stage or costs incurred for data conversion activities  training  maintenance and general and administrative or overhead costs are expenses as incurred 
costs that cannot be separated between maintenance of  and relatively minor upgrades and enhancements to  internal use software are also expensed as incurred 
capitalization begins when the preliminary project stage is complete  management with the relevant authority authorizes and commits to the funding of the software project  it is probable the project will be completed  the software will be used to perform the functions intended and certain functional and quality standards have been met 
our research and development efforts during and related to our e commerce optimization services were primarily maintenance and data conversion activities 
as a result  we did not capitalize any research and development costs during or we expect that during we will capitalize certain internal use software development costs under sop for planned product enhancements for atg e commerce optimization services 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets  including intangible assets we review our long lived assets  including intangible assets subject to amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability 
table of contents of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
in assessing recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount factors 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives  based upon the pattern in which the expected benefits will be realized  or on a straight line basis  whichever is greater 
we did not record any impairment charges in any of the years presented 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on december  as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
because we have one reporting segment under sfas  we utilize the entity wide approach for assessing goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if impairment exists 
no impairment of goodwill resulted from our evaluation of goodwill in any of the years presented  however in the future these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly and adjust the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
as of december   we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realizability of these assets 
as of december   we determined that the deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions would more likely than not be realized 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  we reversed a total of million of the deferred tax valuation allowance 
on january  we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin  which did not result in a material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax contingencies 
the total net liability for uncertain tax positions was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
if these tax positions were settled in our favor these liabilities would be reversed and lower our effective tax rate in the period recorded 
stock based compensation expense since january   we have accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock option awards 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of our underlying common stock 
changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock options  which could have a material impact on our financial statements 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates  our stock based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted

we define product license bookings as product license revenue as reported under gaap plus the contract value of licenses executed and whose recognition was deferred in the current period less revenue that was recognized from license contracts executed and deferred in prior periods 
we believe that this measure provides us with an indication of the amount of new software license business that our direct sales team has added in the period 

table of contents the following table summarizes and reconciles to our product licenses revenue  as reported under us gaap  our product license bookings for the periods presented years ended december  in thousands product license bookings product license bookings deferred product license deferred revenue recognized product license revenue product license bookings increased million  or  to million in from million in and increased million or to million in from million in these increases reflect growth in the e commerce market and the success of our sales and marketing initiatives 
product license bookings deferred was  and of our total product license bookings for  and  respectively 
the increase in deferral of bookings is due to the inclusion of e commerce optimization services  application hosting and other elements in an increasing number of our contracts 
deferred revenue will be recognized in future periods when delivery of the service occurs or as contractual requirements are met 
product license deferred revenue recognized was million  million  and million in  and the increases  particularly in  reflects the cumulative additions to deferred product revenue that have ocurred since we expect first quarter product license bookings to be in the range of equal to the first quarter of or up

partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in professional and education services of million  or total revenue increased million  or  to million for from million for  as a result of the acquisition of estara in october which contributed revenue of million in and to growth in professional and education services revenue of million 
partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in product license revenue of million that was directly a result of the change in our business model requiring us to defer all revenue recognition for fees received up front when software licenses are sold in conjunction with managed application hosting services and or e commerce optimization services 
revenue generated from international customers increased to million  but declined as a percent of total revenue to compared to and of total revenue in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the fluctuation in international revenue as a percent of total revenue is largely attributable to the strength of the us dollar usd relative to the british pound sterling gbp and the euro 
in  the usd lost value relative to the gbp and euro making our goods and services cheaper to foreign customers 
in the second half of  the usd gained value relative to the gbp and euro making our goods and services more expensive to foreign customers

revenue generated and deferred in prior periods is recognized when delivery of the service occurs or as contractual requirements are met 
product license revenue generated from international customers increased to million for from million in product license revenue decreased  to million  for from million in the decrease for is due to deferrals of license revenue related to multiple element transactions in which we are hosting the software or providing e commerce optimization services

partially offsetting this impact is the recognition of million in product license revenue which was deferred in prior periods 
product license revenue generated from international customers increased to million for from million in product license revenue as a percentage of our total revenue increased to in from in while it was in this fluctuation in revenue mix is due in part to the introduction in late of new services  such as our e commerce optimization services  that are included in our recurring services revenue 
the change in revenue mix is also a result of the change in our business model described above  that has resulted in an increased percentage of our software license revenue being recognized in future periods when delivery of the service occurs or as contractual requirements are met

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of money market funds  corporate obligations and government obligations with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk 
however  a change in interest rates would not have a material impact to the fair values of these securities at december  and primarily due to their short maturity and our intent to hold the securities to maturity 
there have been no significant changes since december  the majority of our operations are based in the us  and accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of foreign currencies 
our primary foreign currency exposures relate to our short term intercompany balances with our foreign subsidiaries and accounts receivable valued in the united kingdom in us dollars 
our primary foreign subsidiaries have functional currencies denominated in the british pound and euro  and foreign denominated assets and liabilities are remeasured each reporting period with any exchange gains and losses recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
based on currency exposures existing at december  and  a movement in foreign exchange rates would not expose us to significant gains or losses in earnings or cash flows
