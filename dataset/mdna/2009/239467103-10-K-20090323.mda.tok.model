item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations operating revenues in revenue from operations was  vs 
revenue from operations of  for a decrease of 
in  operating revenues were  equipment sales and kit sales decreased from  in to  in in the company sold four blood volume analyzers for a total of  versus six in for  kit sales increased by in over and by in over kit sales increased by in over and by in over  patients  utilizing the bva  had blood volume measurements in vs 
 in   in and  in for the year ended december  the company provided volumex doses free of charge to facilities utilizing the bva for research versus in  in  in and in the major reasons for the current year increase in kit sales are an increase in utilization of existing instruments along with blood volume analyzers placed in service at december  versus placed in service at december  effective february   the company raised prices by approximately on blood volume kits which was the first price increase in two years 
the company did not raise prices on blood volume kits in the decrease in gross profit percentage on kit sales for the year ended december  is mainly due to the aforementioned increase in volumex doses provided free of charge to facilities using the bva for research 
the main reason for the decrease in gross profit percentage for equipment sales and related services from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  is that six blood volume analyzers were sold in versus four in the gross margin on the blood volume analyzer is substantially higher than the gross margin on volumex kits 
the following table provides gross margin information on equipment sales related services for the years ended december  and december  equipment sales and related services kit sales year ended december  equipment sales and other year ended december  total year ended december  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit gross profit percentage equipment sales and related services kit sales year ended december  equipment sales and other year ended december  total year ended december  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit gross profit percentage operating revenues from cryobanking and related services decreased in by  or from this was due mainly to revenue from semen storage decreasing by  or to  versus  in the year ended december  there was also a decrease of  in semen analysis and other lab services 
the company s idant laboratories subsidiary contributed   and of operating revenues in  and respectively 
operating expenses for  consolidated expenses from operations including cost of sales totaled  and the loss from operations was  in  expenses from operations including cost of sales totaled  the loss from operations was  in  expenses from operations including cost of sales totaled  the loss from operations totaled  total operating costs including cost of sales for daxor and the bva segment were  for the year ended december  versus  for the year ended december  for a decrease of  or 
the main reason for this decrease is a reduction of  in payroll and related expenses 
research and development expenses for daxor and the bva segment decreased in by  or to  from  in however  daxor remains committed to making blood volume analysis a standard of care in at least three disease states 
in order to achieve this goal  we are continuing to spend time and money in research and development in order to get the best product to market 
we are still working on the following three projects gfr glomeril filtration rate  total body albumin analysis  and wipe tests for radiation contamination and detection 
we are also progressing on the next version of the delivery device for the radioactive dose volumex 
the current version is the max which has a patent 
the next version  the max will be without a needle and should give the company extended protection with a second patent when it is completed 
total operating costs including cost of sales for the cryobanking segment were  for the year ended december  versus  for the year ended december  for an increase of  or 
dividend income dividend income earned in was  vs 
 in  for an increase of  or 
in  dividend income was investment gains gains on the sale of investments were  in vs 
 in  and  in a major reason for the increase in gains on the sale of investments in is that the company realized  in gains on a security that was sold as the result of a merger 
this stock would not have otherwise been sold but would have been held by the company as of december  the sum of dividend income plus investment gain from sale of securities was  in   in  and  in liquidity and capital resources the company s management has pursued a policy of maintaining sufficient liquidity and capital resources in order to assure continued availability of necessary funds for the viability and projected growth of all ongoing projects 
at december   the company had  in short term debt versus  at december  the following amounts are included in short term debt at december  and december  income taxes payable of  and  respectively  deferred tax liability of  and  respectively  and securities borrowed at fair market value of  and  the deferred tax liability represents taxes due on the unrealized gain of the investment portfolio and securities borrowed at fair market value represent short positions in common stock 
at december   stockholders equity was  vs 
 at december  at december  the company s security portfolio had a market value of  versus  at december  at december   the company s total liabilities and stockholders equity were  versus  at december  income from the company s security portfolio is a major asset for the company as it conintues its efforts in research and marketing staff 
at december   the company is in a satisfactory financial position with adequate funds available for its immediate and anticipated needs 
the company plans its budgetary outlays on the assumption that the raising of additional financial capital may be difficult in the next to years 
the company believes that its present liquidity and assets are adequate to sustain the expenses associated with its sales and marketing program 
the following table shows the cost  market value  net unrealized gain  unrealized gain and loss at december st from through valuation date cost fair market value net unrealized gain unrealized gains unrealized losses december  december  december  december  december  the company s invested capital has increased over the past years  going from  in to  in the value of the company s investments increased from  in to  during this year period 
the company has been able to partially offset the continuing operating losses which in were the highest in the company s history 
the increase in value of the company s assets provides an underpinning for the company s expanding activities 
while there can be no assurance that these assets will not decrease in value  it is unlikely  at the present time  that they will go back to historical cost 
the company feels  however  that with respect to the blood volume analyzer and the blood optimization program  it is undercapitalized 
recent inquiries have indicated that additional capital is not available on reasonable terms without great dilution to existing shareholders 
the company believes that if the blood volume analyzer becomes a standard of care in any one of the areas described in this k filing  it will then have much easier access to additional capital 
critical accounting policies available for sale securities available for sale securities represent investments in debt and equity securities primarily common and preferred stock of utility companies that management has determined meet the definition of available for sale under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
accordingly  these investments are stated at fair market value and all unrealized holding gains or losses are recorded in the stockholders equity section as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
conversely  all realized gains  losses and earnings are recorded in the statement of operations under other income expense 
the company will also engage in the short selling of stock 
when this occurs  the short position is marked to the market and this adjustment is recorded in the statement of operations 
any gain or loss is recorded for the period presented historical cost is used by the company to determine all gains and losses  and fair market value is obtained by readily available market quotes on all securities 
the company s investment goals  strategies and policies are as follows the company s investment goals are capital preservation and maintaining returns on this capital with a high degree of safety 
the company maintains a diversified securities portfolio comprised primarily of electric utility preferred and common stocks 
the company also sells covered calls on portions of its portfolio and also sells puts on stocks it is willing to own 
it also sells uncovered calls and will engage in short positions up to of the value of its portfolio 
the company s short position may temporarily rise to of the company s portfolio without any specific action because of changes in valuation  but should not exceed this amount 
the company s investment policy is to maintain approximately of of its portfolio in electric utilities 
investments in utilities are primarily in electric companies 
investments in non utility stocks will not exceed of the portfolio 
investment in speculative issues  including short sales  maximum of limited use of options to increase yearly investment income 
a 
the use of call options 
covered options can be sold up to a maximum of of the value of the portfolio 
this provides extra income in addition to dividends received from the company s investments 
the risk of this strategy is that investments the company may have preferred to retain can be called away 
therefore  a limitation of is placed on the amount of stock on which options which can be written 
the amount of the portfolio on which options are actually written is usually between of the portfolio 
the actual turnover of the portfolio is such that the average holding period is in excess of years for available for sale securities 
b 
the use of put options 
put options are written on stocks which the company is willing to purchase 
while the company does not have a high rate of turnover in its portfolio  there is some turnover  for example  due to preferred stocks being called back by the issuing company  or stocks being called away because call options have been written 
if the stock does not go below the put exercise price  the company records the proceeds from the sale as income 
if the put is exercised  the cost basis is reduced by the proceeds received from the sale of the put option 
there may be occasions where the cost basis of the stock is lower than the market price at the time the option is exercised 
c 
speculative short sales short options 
the company limits its speculative transactions to no more than of the value of the portfolio 
the company may sell uncovered calls on certain stocks 
if the stock price does not rise to the price of the calls  the option is not exercised  and the company records the proceeds from the sale of the call as income 
if the call is exercised  the company will have a short position in the related stock 
the company then has the choice of covering the short position or selling a put against it 
if the put is exercised  the short position is covered 
the company s current accounting policy is to mark to the market at the end of each quarter any short positions  and include it in the income statement 
while the company may have so called speculative positions equal to of its accounts  in actual practice the average short stock positions usually account for less than of the assets of the company 
in the event of a merger  the company will elect to receive shares in the new company 
in the event of a cash only offer  the company will receive cash and be forced to sell its stock 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss the company s condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the company considers the following accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company recognizes operational revenues from several sources 
the first source is the outright sale of equipment  the blood volume analyzer  to customers 
the second source is the sale and associated shipping revenues of single use radioisotope doses volumex that are injected into the patient and measured by the blood volume analyzer 
the third source of revenue is service contracts on the blood volume analyzer  after it has been sold to a customer 
the fourth source of revenue is the storage fees associated with cryobanked blood and semen specimens 
the fifth is lab revenues from laboratory services  and the sixth is revenue from semen sales 
the company currently offers three different methods of purchasing the blood volume analyzer equipment 
a customer may purchase the equipment directly  lease the equipment  or rent the equipment on a month to month basis 
the revenues generated by a direct sale or a monthly rental are recognized as revenue in the period in which the sale or rental occurred 
if a customer is to select the lease option  the company refers its customer to a third party finance company with which it has established a relationship  and if the lease is approved  the company receives of the sales proceeds from the finance company and recognizes of the revenue 
the finance company then deals directly with the customer with regard to lease payments and related collections 
daxor corporation does not guarantee payments to the leasing company 
the sales of the single use radioisotope doses volumex that are used in conjunction with the blood volume analyzer are recognized as revenue in the period in which the sale occurred 
when blood volume analyzer equipment has been sold to a customer  the company offers a one year warranty on the product  which covers all mechanical failures 
this one year warranty is effective on the date of sale of the equipment 
after the one year period expires  customers may purchase a service contract through the company 
historically  service contracts were recorded by the company as deferred revenue and were amortized into income in the period in which they were earned 
effective january   the company began offering service contracts priced on an annual basis which are billed annually or quarterly depending upon the contractual arrangement with the customer 
there were four hospitals that the company billed during the year ended december  for the entire amount of their annual service contract 
at december  and december   deferred revenue pertaining to the historical service contracts was  and  respectively 
the storage fees associated with the cryobanked blood and semen samples are recognized as income in the period for which the fee applies 
the company invoices customers for storage fees for various time periods 
these time periods range from one month up to one  two or three years 
the company will only recognize revenue for those storage fees that are earned in the current reporting period  and will defer the remaining revenues to the period in which they are earned 
effective october   the company has altered our billing procedure as such that clients will only be billed on a quarterly basis 
therefore  future revenue recognition will not include deferred revenue on the storage fees  but rather will be earned in the same period in which the invoices are generated 
comprehensive income loss the company reports components of comprehensive income under the requirements of sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
this statement establishes rules for the reporting of comprehensive income and requires certain transactions to be presented as separate components of stockholders equity 
the company currently reports the unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale securities  net of deferred taxes  as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
product warrantees and related liabilities the company offers a one year warranty on the blood volume analyzer equipment 
this warranty is effective on the date of sale and covers all mechanical failures of the equipment 
all major components of the equipment are purchased and warranted by the original third party manufacturers 
once the initial one year warranty period has expired  customers may purchase annual service contracts for the equipment 
these service contracts warranty the mechanical failures of the equipment that are not associated with normal wear and tear of the components 
to date  the company has not experienced any major mechanical failures on any equipment sold 
in addition  the majority of the potential liability would revert to the original manufacturer 
due to this history  a liability has not been recorded with respect to product warranty liability 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the results of operations during the reporting periods 
although these estimates are based upon management s best knowledge of current events and actions  actual results could differ from those estimates income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this pronouncement requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of event attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations in the period in which the enactment rate changes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
contractual obligations in december  the company signed a lease which commenced on january   for its existing facility at the empire state building 
the lease expires on december  the company has occupied this space since january the company currently occupies approximately  square feet 
there are options for an additional  square feet of space 
the company has acquired a  square foot manufacturing facility in oak ridge  tennessee which is currently manufacturing the bva blood volume analyzers  and where r d activities are performed 
the company s volumex syringes are filled by an fda approved radio pharmaceutical manufacturer 
the manufacturer has worked with daxor since the manufacturer s prices are reviewed annually 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total this amount represents the total monthly mortgage payment of  which includes principal and interest for the property purchased at and meco lane in oak ridge  tennessee 
there is a monthly payment of  through december of the company has the option of making a balloon payment of  in january of or refinancing the remaining amount of the mortgage 
this amount represents a total monthly rental payment of  which consists of base rent of  and for two separate spaces at th avenue 
summary of actual portfolio investments the company s portfolio value is exposed to fluctuations in the general value of utilities 
an increase of interest rates could affect the company in two ways one would be to put downward pressure on the valuation of utility stocks as well as increase the company s cost of borrowing 
because of the size of the unrealized gains in the company s portfolio  the company does not anticipate any changes which could reduce the value of the company s utility portfolio below historical cost 
utilities operate in an environment of federal  state and local regulations  and they may disproportionately affect an individual utility 
the company s exposure to regulatory risk is mitigated due to it s diversity of holdings 
at december  and  the company held and separate stocks  respectively 
puts and calls are marked to market for each reporting period and any gain or loss is recognized through the statement of operations and labeled as mark to market of short positions

summary of put and call options at december  description proceeds received market value unrealized gains unrealized losses puts calls total puts and calls item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in light of the safe harbor provisions so that a company could not be considered an investment company  we have done an analysis of what would have occurred if the company had elected to use a safe harbor provision instead of the cash management program that it developed which utilizes dividend paying utilities combined with option sales 
it should be noted that it is not mandatory to utilize t bills  only that it is a safe harbor provision  where one is not required to explain or justify that one is an operating company rather than in investment company 
we elected to augment the company s revenue rather than accept the safe harbor t bill scenario 
we understood that there were risks  and the concept was approved by the board of directors of daxor before this policy was inaugurated 
the board of directors reviews and approves the investment policy at least once a year 
the current policy is the primary investments are in electric utilities  no more than of the company s assets can be in shorts at any one time  the company can continue to sell covered call options  sell naked put options on securities it is willing to own  concentration of no more than of any one stock in the portfolio  if a stock were to grow to more than due to natural increase in value  it is exempt from the concentration rule 
the company has always had on its board of directors  for the last twenty years  at least one person who could be considered an expert on investing accounting policy with wall street experience 
in  the company had a secondary offering which raised approximately million 
in  prior to clearance by the sec of the underwriting  the company had its cash management policy of investing in electric utilities reviewed by the sec 
the sec reviewed the policy and the company s operations  and permitted the secondary offering to proceed without any alterations 
in  the company had its cash management investment policies questioned by the sec and no action was taken against the company 
the following graphs illustrate what would have happened to the company if the company had chosen at that time  beginning in  to undertake a so called safe harbor policy 
two separate t bill rates were used for this analysis  one for an average rate of approximately  and one for an average rate of approximately 
the and scenarios are reasonable approximations of which the company might have encountered during this time 
during the year period of which is covered in this analysis  the annual yield on us treasuries at a one year constant maturity varied from to 
in november  the company s cash policy was again questioned by the sec and a formal response was provided by the company on january  the following additional information is provided to illustrate what the company s current financial position would have been had it followed a simple policy of investing its cash in treasury securities 
the company also is providing a graph adapted from information provided on the federal reserve website at www 
federalreserve 
gov 
the company provided similar information in an amended k filed on november  the current graphs include the year ended december  graph illustrates three sets of data from to the company s reported net income from all sources  the company s operation income minus operating expenses  and a hypothetical net income calculated assuming that  rather than following its existing investment policy  the company had invested in treasury bills and received an interest rate of 
graph comparison of net earnings with hypothetical earnings that would have resulted had the company invested in treasury bills from to and received a interest rate message for the years ended december  and  the company had net income of  and  respectively 
however  for the years ended december   and  the company recorded losses of   and  despite supplemental revenue from investments 
for the years ended december  through december  the company sustained heavy operating losses but was close to breaking even due to supplemental income 
from to  the company reported a net profit despite increasing losses from operations 
as can be seen  from through  the company also sustained operating losses 
had the company invested in treasury bills and received a interest rate  the annual losses for through would have been approximately million 
in  the loss would have been over million and in close to million 
from  the company would have lost approximately million each year 
graph comparison of net earnings with hypothetical earnings that would have resulted had the company invested in treasury bills from to and received a interest rate message graph shows the same basic scenario as graph  except that the hypothetical net income was calculated assuming a interest rate from treasury bills 
the results are similar to those from graph  but the loss is slightly lower because of the higher interest rate 
graph hypothetical change in company assets that would have occurred had persistent losses from investment in treasury bills with a rate of interest forced the company to cover losses by liquidating sections of its portfolio message graph compares the company s marketable securities at cost with a hypothetical value of securities 
this hypothetical value was calculated assuming that the company had begun investing in treasury bills in and received a interest rate 
the marketable securities at cost approximately represent the amount of money the company has available  or its approximate assets 
using our existing investment policy  the cost of the company s marketable securities has gradually increased from approximately million at december  to approximately million at december  had the company invested in treasury bills  because of the continuing net loss as demonstrated in graph  the company would have been forced to steadily sell investment capital to cover those losses 
the calculations take this dwindling supply of capital into account 
lost capital would only have been partially replaced by interest on the treasury bills  and the amount of investment income would have declined as the amount of capital decreased 
by year end  the value of the company s securities would have dwindled to approximately million  from a starting point of over million 
by year end  the estimated value of the securities would have fallen to approximately million and the company would likely have faced likely bankruptcy by the end of graph hypothetical change in company assets that would have occurred had persistent losses from investment in treasury bills a rate of interest forced the company to cover losses by liquidating sections of its portfolio line graph graph illustrates the same scenario as graph  but assuming a interest rate from treasury bills 
the loss is somewhat less in this scenario  but by year end  securities would have fallen to approximately million  and the estimated value of the securities by would have been approximately million by the end of under this scenario  the company would have been facing bankruptcy by the end of graph loans payable per year line graph graph illustrates the company s loans payable at december from to from to  the amount of loans payable decreased sharply  and then stayed in a narrow range from to  remaining below million and reaching a low of million at december  after  because of the company s expanded research and development  the amount of loans began to increase steadily until december   when they exceeded the amount 
by december   the amount of loans returned somewhat to levels 
the increase in the loan balance at december  is mainly a result of the increased cost of the investment portfolio 
graph operating revenues and total expenses from to line graph graph illustrates operational revenues and total expenses from to operational revenues dropped sharply between and between and  operational revenues began to recover  and reached pre levels in expenses were fairly constant between and  but they have increased since because of the expansion in research  development  and marketing 
throughout the entire sixteen year period of  operating expenses have exceeded operating revenues each year 
graph marketable securities at cost compared to the rate of return line graph graph shows the cost of securities compared with rate of return investment income cost of securities from to the rate of return includes dividends and net profits from security sales  but it does not include unrealized profits 
if unrealized profits had been included  the rate of return would have been higher 
the actual rate of return is more than three times the rate of return that the company would have received if the company had invested exclusively in treasury bills 
the company  therefore  has benefited from the cash management policy of the past years 
graph portfolio of treasury securities at one year constant maturity from from federal reserve bank data 
line graph graph shows the market yield for the past years on u

the yields have ranged from a high of in down to a low of in the average yield for the past sixteen years is  and the average interest rate for the past five years is 
graph comparison of net earnings with hypothetical earnings that would have resulted had the company invested in treasury bills with yields reported by the federal reserve bank from line graph graph illustrates the same three sets of data as graphs and  utilizing interest rates from graph the results are similar to those from the previous two graphs  validating the accuracy of those hypothetical predictions 
had the company invested in these or similar treasury bills  the company would have faced persistent losses over this year period 
graph hypothetical change in company assets that would have occurred had persistent losses from investment in treasury bills with yields reported by the federal reserve bank forced the company to cover losses by liquidating sections of its portfolio line graph graph illustrates the same scenario as graphs and  utilizing the interest rates from graph again  the results are very similar to those from graphs and  providing validation for the hypothetical predictions 
by year end  securities would have fallen to approximately million  and securities by year end to been approximately million 
had the company invested in these or similar treasury bills  by year end  the value of the securities would have fallen to million and the company would likely have faced bankruptcy in
