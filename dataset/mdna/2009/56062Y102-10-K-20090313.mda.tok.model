results of operations net income was  in   in  and  in earnings per common share on a fully diluted basis were in  in  and in the primary driver that led to the decrease in net income in was the  increase in the company s loan loss provision expense 
the increase in provision expense was partially offset by an increase of  in net interest income as the company s net interest margin increased by basis points year over year 
the decrease from to in overall net income and earnings per share was primarily attributable to three factors the decrease in the company s net interest margin  the increase in the company s loan loss provision expense  and the expenses incurred for the data processing system conversions of the hobart and crawfordsville affiliates

tax equivalent net interest income of  in increased from  in net interest margin  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  was for compared to for the same period a year ago 
due to rate reductions by the federal reserve during the year  the company s cost of funds decreased steadily throughout the year and outpaced the decrease in the yield on earning assets 
in addition  there was a favorable shift in the company s volume and mix of earning assets as lower yielding residential real estate loans were replaced by higher yielding commercial loans

loans  credit risk and the allowance and provision for loan losses loans remain the company s largest concentration of assets and continue to represent the greatest potential risk 
the loan underwriting standards observed by the company s subsidiaries are viewed by management as a means of controlling problem loans and the resulting charge offs 
the company s conservative loan underwriting standards have historically resulted in higher loan quality and generally lower levels of net charge offs than peer group averages 
the company also believes credit risks may be elevated if undue concentrations of loans in specific industry segments and to out of area borrowers are incurred 
accordingly  the company s board of directors regularly monitors such concentrations to determine compliance with its loan concentration policy 
the company believes it has no undue concentrations of loans 
total loans excluding those held for sale increased by  from year end the acquisition of st independence in august accounted for  of the increase in loans

as a general rule  commercial and real estate loans are reclassified to nonaccrual status at or before becoming days past due 
interest previously recorded is reversed and charged against current income 
subsequent interest payments collected on nonaccrual loans are thereafter applied as a reduction of the loan s principal balance

the company has both internal and external loan review personnel who annually review approximately of all loans 
external loan review personnel examine all commercial credit relationships over 
table of contents the ability to absorb loan losses promptly when problems are identified is invaluable to a banking organization 
most often  losses incurred as a result of prompt  aggressive collection actions are much lower than losses incurred after prolonged legal proceedings 
accordingly  the company observes the practice of quickly initiating stringent collection efforts in the early stages of loan delinquency 
during  the company established a separate group solely responsible for the collection of problem loans 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in each subsidiary is reviewed at least quarterly 
the determination of the provision amount in any period is based upon management s continuing review and evaluation of loan loss experience  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  classified loans including non accrual and impaired loans  current economic conditions  the amount of loans presently outstanding  and the amount and composition of loan growth

at the time of acquisition  these loans had evidence of credit deterioration 
in applying this accounting standard  an allowance for loan losses amount was not carried over or established for these loans 
instead these loans are carried at their fair value at date of acquisition including consideration of expected cash flows to be received

the average life of the company s investment securities portfolio was years at december  during the investment universe saw significant disruptions as the fall out from the deterioration in the real estate market intensified 
increased risk premiums drove investment yields higher even as the federal reserve continued its march toward lower rates 
this allowed the company s portfolio to increase its yield while maintaining its standard conservative investment strategy and limiting its credit risk profile 
entering the portfolio remains focused on providing liquidity and avoiding additional credit risk during the ongoing economic turmoil 
the company and its investment advisor monitor the securities portfolio on a monthly basis 
as securities in a significant loss position are identified  a review of the underlying credit is performed 
securities are written down to fair value when a decline in fair value is not considered temporary 
in estimating other than temporary losses  management considers the length of time and extent that fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the company s ability and intent to hold the security for a period sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
sources of funds the company relies primarily on customer deposits and securities sold under agreement to repurchase repurchase agreements  along with shareholders equity to fund earning assets

table of contents december   tier capital to average assets was 
total capital to risk weighted assets was 
both ratios exceed all required ratios established for bank holding companies 
risk adjusted capital levels of each of the company s subsidiary banks exceed regulatory definitions of well capitalized institutions 
the trust preferred securities which are classified as subordinated debentures qualify as tier capital or core capital with respect to the company under the risk based capital guidelines established by the federal reserve 
under such guidelines  capital received from the proceeds of the sale of these securities cannot constitute more than of the total tier capital of the company 
consequently  the amount of trust preferred securities in excess of the limitation constitutes tier capital  or supplementary capital  of the company 
as of december   all of the company s trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital 
common shareholders equity is impacted by the company s decision to categorize its securities portfolio as available for sale afs 
securities in this category are carried at fair value  and common shareholders equity is adjusted to reflect unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes 
the company declared and paid common dividends of

on january   the company entered into an agreement with the united states department of treasury the treasury department as part of the treasury department s capital purchase program 
under this agreement  the company issued to the treasury department  shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a preferred stock and a warrant to purchase up to  shares warrant shares of the company s common stock  at an initial per share exercise price of 
like stock options  the warrant issued through the capital purchase program is potentially dilutive 
the average stock price for the company for was per share and the warrant issued in has an exercise price of per share 
this results in additional potentially dilutive shares of approximately  and does not significantly impact earnings per share 
the preferred stock pays cumulative dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years and per year thereafter 
the company may  at its option and at any time  redeem the preferred stock for the liquidation amount of  per share  plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
while the preferred stock is outstanding  the company may only pay dividends on common stock if all accrued and unpaid dividends for the preferred stock have been paid 
the company cannot increase its quarterly cash dividend above historical levels without the prior consent of treasury until the earlier of three years following the date of the sale of the preferred stock to the treasury or the date the preferred stock is no longer held by treasury 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on the company s participation in the capital purchase program 
liquidity liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient cash levels to fund operations and to meet the requirements of borrowers  depositors and creditors 
higher levels of liquidity bear higher corresponding costs  measured in terms of lower yields on short term  more liquid earning assets and higher interest expense involved in extending liability maturities 
liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents  loans and securities maturing within one year and money market instruments 
in addition  the company holds approximately  of afs securities maturing after one year  which can be sold to meet liquidity needs 
maintaining a relatively stable funding base  which is achieved by diversifying funding sources  supports liquidity  extends the contractual maturity of liabilities  and limits reliance on volatile short term purchased funds 
short term funding needs may arise from declines in deposits or other funding sources  funding of loan commitments and requests for new loans 
the company s strategy is to fund assets to the maximum extent possible with core deposits  which provide a sizable source of relatively stable low cost funds 
the company defines core deposits as all deposits except certificates of deposits greater than average core deposits funded approximately of total earning assets during and approximately in management believes the company has sufficient liquidity to meet all reasonable borrower  depositor and creditor needs in the present economic environment 
the company has not received any directives from regulatory authorities that would materially affect liquidity  capital resources or operations 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december  total less than year years years more than years time deposits fhlb advances subordinated debentures total off balance sheet arrangements the banks incur off balance sheet risks in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of their customers 
these risks derive from commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
off balance sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments  although material losses are not anticipated 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on the company s off balance sheet arrangements 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s financial condition to adverse changes in market interest rates 
in an effort to estimate the impact of sustained interest rate movements to the company s earnings  the company monitors interest rate risk through computer assisted simulation modeling of its net interest income 
the company s simulation modeling monitors the potential impact to net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
the company s objective is to actively manage its asset liability position within a one year interval and to limit the risk in any of the interest rate scenarios to a reasonable level of tax equivalent net interest income within that interval 
the company monitors compliance within established guidelines of the funds management policy 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section for further discussion regarding interest rate risk 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
these policies require estimates and assumptions 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions  or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
in management s opinion  some of these areas have a more significant impact than others on the company s financial reporting 
these areas currently include accounting for the allowance for loan losses  goodwill  and income taxes 
allowance for loan losses the level of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios  past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay including the timing of future payments  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  composition of the loan portfolio  economic conditions  and other pertinent factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
the level of allowance maintained is believed by management to be adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries of amounts previously charged off 
goodwill statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations and no 
goodwill and other intangible assets were issued in june of and were effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under these rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  if any  will no longer be amortized  but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
the company has selected june as its date for annual impairment testing  but will test more frequently if circumstances warrant 
income taxes the company is subject to the income tax laws of the us  its states and the municipalities in which it operates 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities 
the company reviews income tax expense and the carrying value of deferred tax assets  and as new information becomes available  the balances are adjusted as appropriate 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  the company makes judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws and also makes estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions 
new accounting matters see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding the adoption of new accounting standards in 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committees and boards of directors of the company and its subsidiary banks 
primary market risks  which impact the company s operations  are liquidity risk and interest rate risk  as discussed above 
as discussed previously  the company monitors interest rate risk by the use of computer simulation modeling to estimate the potential impact on its net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
another method by which the company s interest rate risk position can be estimated is by computing estimated changes in its net portfolio value npv 
this method estimates interest rate risk exposure from movements in interest rates by using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in the npv of discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities 
computations are based on a number of assumptions  including the relative levels of market interest rates and prepayments in mortgage loans and certain types of investments 
these computations do not contemplate any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
in addition  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of computing npv 
should interest rates remain or decrease below current levels  the proportion of adjustable rate loans could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity 
in the event of an interest rate change  prepayment levels would likely be different from those assumed in the table 
lastly  the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate debt may decline during a rising interest rate environment 
the following tables provide an assessment of the risk to npv in the event of sudden and sustained and increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates 
the table indicates that as of december  the company s estimated npv might be expected to increase in the event of an increase in prevailing interest rates  and might be expected to decrease in the event of a decrease in prevailing interest rates dollars in thousands

actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied therein as a result of certain risks and uncertainties  including those risks and uncertainties expressed above  those that are described in management s discussion and analysis in item of this report  those that are described in item of this report  business  under the caption forward looking statements and associated risks  and those that are described in item a of this report  risk factors  all of which discussions are incorporated herein by reference
