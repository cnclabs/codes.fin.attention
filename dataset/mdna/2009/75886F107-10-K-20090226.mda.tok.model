item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers  develops  and commercializes pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical conditions 
we currently have one marketed product arcalyst rilonacept injection for subcutaneous use  which is now available for prescription in the united states for the treatment of cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes caps  including familial cold auto inflammatory syndrome fcas and muckle wells syndrome mws in adults and children and older 
we also have six clinical development programs  including three late stage clinical programs 
our late stage programs are aflibercept vegf trap  which is being developed in oncology in collaboration with the sanofi aventis group  vegf trap eye  which is being developed in eye diseases using intraocular delivery in collaboration with bayer healthcare llc  and arcalyst which is being developed for the treatment of gout 
our earlier stage clinical programs are regn  an antibody to the interleukin receptor il r  regn  an antibody to delta like ligand dll  which is being developed in rheumatoid arthritis  and regn  an antibody to nerve growth factor ngf  which is being developed for the treatment of pain 
all three of these antibodies are being developed with sanofi aventis 
our preclinical research programs are in the areas of oncology and angiogenesis  ophthalmology  metabolic and related diseases  muscle diseases and disorders  inflammation and immune diseases  bone and cartilage  pain  and cardiovascular diseases 
developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and expense 
since inception we have not generated any significant sales or profits from the commercialization of arcalyst or any of our other product candidates 
before significant revenues from the commercialization of arcalyst or our other product candidates can be realized  we or our collaborators must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing research and development and obtaining regulatory approval from the fda and regulatory authorities in other countries 
in addition  the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and new developments may render our products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete 
from inception on january  through december   we had a cumulative loss of million 
in the absence of significant revenues from the commercialization of arcalyst or our other product candidates or other sources  the amount  timing  nature  and source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities 
we expect to incur substantial losses over the next several years as we continue the clinical development of vegf trap eye and arcalyst  advance new product candidates into clinical development from our existing research programs utilizing our technologies for designing fully human monoclonal antibodies  continue our research and development programs  and commercialize additional product candidates that receive regulatory approval  if any 
also  our activities may expand over time and require additional resources  and we expect our operating losses to be substantial over at least the next several years 
our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on  among other factors  the progress of our research and development efforts  the timing of certain expenses  and the amount and timing of payments that we receive from collaborators 
as a company that does not expect to be profitable over the next several years  management of cash flow is extremely important 
the most significant use of our cash is for research and development activities  which include drug discovery  preclinical studies  clinical trials  and the manufacture of drug supplies for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we are reimbursed for some of these research and development activities by our collaborators 
our principal sources of cash to date have been from i sales of common equity  both in public offerings and to our collaborators  including sanofi aventis  ii a private placement of convertible debt  which was repaid in full during  and iii funding from our collaborators in the form of up front payments  research progress payments  and payments for our research and development activities 
in  our research and development expenses totaled million 
in  we expect these expenses to increase substantially as we i continue to expand our research and preclinical and clinical development activities in connection with our antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis  ii expand our vegf trap eye  arcalyst  and aflibercept clinical programs  and iii increase our research and development headcount 
a primary driver of our expenses is our number of full time employees 
our annual average headcount in was compared with in and in in our average headcount increased primarily to support our expanded research and development activities in connection with our antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis 
in our average headcount increased primarily to support our expanded development programs for vegf trap eye and arcalyst and our plans to move our first antibody candidate into clinical trials 
in  we expect our average headcount to increase to approximately  primarily to support the further expansion of our research  development  and marketing activities as described above  especially in connection with our antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis 
the planning  execution  and results of our clinical programs are significant factors that can affect our operating and financial results 
in our clinical programs  key events in and plans for are as follows clinical program events plans arcalyst received fda approval for caps initiate phase development rilonacept  also launched arcalyst program of arcalyst in known as il commercially in caps the prevention of gout flares trap reported data from a phase study in in patients initiating urate the prevention of gout flares in patients lowering drug therapy and in initiating urate lowering drug therapy acute gout aflibercept reported final data from phase initiate phase st line study in vegf trap single agent trial in advanced ovarian metastatic colorectal cancer in oncology cancer combination with chemotherapy reported results from four phase report results of phase dose escalation studies in combination single agent study in sma with chemotherapy in solid tumors continue enrollment of four completed enrollment of phase phase studies single agent study in symptomatic malignant ascites sma vegf trap eye presented positive final data through complete enrollment in view intravitreal weeks from the phase trial in wet and view trials injection amd continue enrolling patients in bayer healthcare initiated second the phase dme trial phase trial view in wet amd outside the united states initiated a phase study in dme monoclonal filed ind for regn anti dll initiate phase trial for antibodies filed ind for regn anti ngf regn in oncology initiate phase trial for regn report data from phase trial of regn anti il r in rheumatoid arthritis advance additional antibody candidate s into clinical development critical accounting policies and use of estimates a summary of the significant accounting policies that impact us is provided in note to our financial statements  beginning on page f the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires an assumption or assumptions regarding a future outcome  and changes in the estimate or the use of different assumptions to prepare the estimate could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
the critical accounting estimates that impact our financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition contract research and development revenue we recognize contract research and development revenue and research progress payments in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab and emerging issues task force  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
we earn contract research and development revenue and research progress payments in connection with collaboration and other agreements to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology platforms 
the terms of these agreements typically include non refundable up front licensing payments  research progress milestone payments  and payments for development activities 
non refundable up front license payments  where continuing involvement is required of us  are deferred and recognized over the related performance period 
we estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each agreement  and adjust the performance periods  if appropriate  based on the applicable facts and circumstances 
payments which are based on achieving a specific substantive performance milestone  involving a degree of risk  are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due and non refundable  provided there is no future service obligation associated with that milestone 
substantive performance milestones typically consist of significant achievements in the development life cycle of the related product candidate  such as completion of clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies  and approvals by regulatory agencies 
in determining whether a payment is deemed to be a substantive performance milestone  we take into consideration i the nature  timing  and value of significant achievements in the development life cycle of the related development product candidate  ii the relative level of effort required to achieve the milestone  and iii the relative level of risk in achieving the milestone  taking into account the high degree of uncertainty in successfully advancing product candidates in a drug development program and in ultimately attaining an approved drug product 
payments for achieving milestones which are not considered substantive are accounted for as license payments and recognized over the related performance period 
we enter into collaboration agreements that include varying arrangements regarding which parties perform and bear the costs of research and development activities 
we may share the costs of research and development activities with our collaborator  such as in our vegf trap eye collaboration with bayer healthcare  or we may be reimbursed for all or a significant portion of the costs of our research and development activities  such as in our aflibercept and antibody collaborations with sanofi aventis 
we record our internal and third party development costs associated with these collaborations as research and development expenses 
when we are entitled to reimbursement of all or a portion of the research and development expenses that we incur under a collaboration  we record those reimbursable amounts as contract research and development revenue proportionately as we recognize our expenses 
if the collaboration is a cost sharing arrangement in which both we and our collaborator perform development work and share costs  in periods when our collaborator incurs development expenses that benefit the collaboration and regeneron  we also recognize  as additional research and development expense  the portion of the collaborator s development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
in addition  we record revenue in connection with a government research grant using a proportional performance model as we incur expenses related to the grant  subject to the grant s terms and annual funding approvals 
in connection with non refundable licensing payments  our performance period estimates are principally based on projections of the scope  progress  and results of our research and development activities 
due to the variability in the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug product  changes to development plans as programs progress  and uncertainty in the ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  revisions to performance period estimates are likely to occur periodically and could result in material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year in the future 
in addition  our estimated performance periods may change if development programs encounter delays or we and our collaborators decide to expand or contract our clinical plans for a drug candidate in various disease indications 
for example  for the year ended december   we recognized million less in contract research and development revenue  compared to amounts recognized in  in connection with non refundable up front payments previously received from sanofi aventis pursuant to the companies aflibercept collaboration  due to an extension of our estimated performance period 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we extended our estimated performance period in connection with the up front and milestone payments previously received from bayer healthcare pursuant to the companies vegf trap eye collaboration and shortened our estimated performance period in connection with up front payments from sanofi aventis pursuant to the companies aflibercept collaboration 
the net effect of these changes in our estimates resulted in the recognition of million less in contract research and development revenue in the fourth quarter of  compared to amounts recognized in connection with these deferred payments in each of the prior three quarters of also  if a collaborator terminates an agreement in accordance with the terms of the agreement  we would recognize any unamortized remainder of an up front or previously deferred payment at the time of the termination 
product revenue in march  arcalyst rilonacept became available for prescription in the united states for the treatment of caps 
we recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with sab revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  collection from the customer is reasonably assured  and we have no further performance obligations 
revenue and deferred revenue from product sales are recorded net of applicable provisions for prompt pay discounts  product returns  estimated rebates payable under governmental programs including medicaid  distributor fees  and other sales related costs 
we account for these reductions in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products eitf  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists  as applicable 
in accordance with eitf and sfas  since we currently have limited historical return and rebate experience for arcalyst  product sales revenues are deferred until i the right of return no longer exists or we can reasonably estimate returns and ii rebates have been processed or we can reasonably estimate rebates 
we review our estimates of rebates payable each period and record any necessary adjustments in the current period s net product sales 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
we outsource a substantial portion of our clinical trial activities  utilizing external entities such as contract research organizations  independent clinical investigators  and other third party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies 
for each clinical trial that we conduct  certain clinical trial costs are expensed immediately  while others are expensed over time based on the expected total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which patients enter the trial  and the period over which clinical investigators or contract research organizations are expected to provide services 
clinical activities which relate principally to clinical sites and other administrative functions to manage our clinical trials are performed primarily by contract research organizations cros 
cros typically perform most of the start up activities for our trials  including document preparation  site identification  screening and preparation  pre study visits  training  and program management 
on a budgeted basis  these start up costs are typically to of the total contract value 
on an actual basis  this percentage range can be significantly wider  as many of our contracts with cros are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget  while start up costs for the particular trial may not change materially 
these start up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are event driven in nature 
the remaining activities and related costs  such as patient monitoring and administration  generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we accrue and recognize expenses in an amount based on our estimate of the remaining non cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical trial and or penalties 
for clinical study sites  where payments are made periodically on a per patient basis to the institutions performing the clinical study  we accrue on an estimated cost per patient basis an expense based on subject enrollment and activity in each quarter 
the amount of clinical study expense recognized in a quarter may vary from period to period based on the duration and progress of the study  the activities to be performed by the sites each quarter  the required level of patient enrollment  the rate at which patients actually enroll in and drop out of the clinical study  and the number of sites involved in the study 
clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those that have a significant number of sites  require a large number of patients  have complex patient screening requirements  and span multiple years 
during the course of a trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
our estimates and assumptions for clinical expense recognition could differ significantly from our actual results  which could cause material increases or decreases in research and development expenses in future periods when the actual results become known 
no material adjustments to our past clinical trial accrual estimates were made during the years ended december  or stock based employee compensation we account for stock based employee compensation under the provisions of sfas r  share based payment 
we use the black scholes model to compute the estimated fair value of stock option awards 
using this model  fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to i expected volatility of our common stock price  ii the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise expected lives  iii expected dividend yield on our common stock  and iv risk free interest rates  which are based on quoted us treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options expected lives 
expected volatility has been estimated based on actual movements in our stock price over the most recent historical periods equivalent to the options expected lives 
expected lives are principally based on our limited historical exercise experience with previously issued employee and board of director option grants 
the expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future 
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of option awards reflect our best estimates but involve uncertainties related to market and other conditions  many of which are outside of our control 
changes in any of these assumptions may materially affect the fair value of stock options granted and the amount of stock based compensation recognized in future periods 
in addition  we have granted performance based stock option awards which vest based upon the optionee satisfying certain performance and service conditions as defined in the agreements 
potential compensation cost  measured on the grant date  related to these performance options will be recognized only if  and when  these options performance conditions are considered to be probable of attainment 
marketable securities we consider our marketable securities  which consist primarily of us government  corporate  and asset backed securities  to be available for sale  as defined by sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these assets are carried at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are included in other accumulated comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity 
if the decline in the value of a marketable security in our investment portfolio is deemed to be other than temporary  we write down the security to its current fair value and recognize a loss that is charged against income 
on a quarterly basis  we review our portfolio of marketable securities  using both quantitative and qualitative factors  to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other than temporary 
such factors include the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost  financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  recommendations of investment advisors  and forecasts of economic  market  or industry trends 
this review process also includes an evaluation of our ability and intent to hold individual securities until they mature or their full value can be recovered 
this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment 
as a result of our quarterly reviews of our marketable securities portfolio  during and  we recorded charges for other than temporary impairment of our marketable securities totaling million and million  respectively 
however  the current economic environment  the deterioration in the credit quality of some of the issuers of securities that we hold  and the recent volatility of securities markets increase the risk that there could be further declines in the market value of marketable securities in our investment portfolio and that such declines could result in additional charges against income in future periods for other than temporary impairments  and such amounts could be material 
depreciation of property  plant  and equipment property  plant  and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
in some situations  the life of the asset may be extended or shortened if circumstances arise that would lead us to believe that the estimated life of the asset has changed 
the life of leasehold improvements may change based on the extension of lease contracts with our landlords 
changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods 
results of operations years ended december  and net loss regeneron reported a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted for the decrease in net loss was principally due to revenues earned in in connection with our november antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis  partly offset by higher research and development expenses 
revenues revenues for the years ended december  and consist of the following in millions contract research development revenue sanofi aventis bayer healthcare other total contract research development revenue technology licensing revenue net product sales total revenue the contract research and development revenue we earn from sanofi aventis  as detailed below  consists partly of reimbursement for research and development expenses and partly of the recognition of revenue related to non refundable up front payments of million related to the aflibercept collaboration and million related to the antibody collaboration

recognition of deferred revenue relates to sanofi aventis up front aflibercept payments 
as of december   million of the original million of up front payments related to aflibercept was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods 
in  sanofi aventis reimbursement of regeneron s antibody expenses consisted of million under the discovery agreement and million of development costs  related primarily to regn  under the license agreement  compared to million and million respectively  in recognition of deferred revenue under the antibody collaboration related to sanofi aventis million up front payment 
as of december   million of this up front payment was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods 
as described above  in august  we entered into a separate velocigene agreement with sanofi aventis 
for the year ended december   we recognized million in revenue related to this agreement 
the contract research and development revenue we earn from bayer healthcare  as detailed below  consists partly of cost sharing of regeneron vegf trap eye development expenses and partly of recognition of revenue related to a non refundable million up front payment and million milestone payment 
years ended december  bayer healthcare contract research development revenue in millions cost sharing of regeneron vegf trap eye development expenses recognition of deferred revenue related to up front and milestone payments total bayer healthcare contract research development revenue for the period from the collaboration s inception in october through september   all up front licensing  milestone  and cost sharing payments received or receivable from bayer healthcare had been fully deferred and included in deferred revenue 
in the fourth quarter of  we and bayer healthcare approved a global development plan for vegf trap eye in wet amd 
the plan included estimated development steps  timelines  and costs  as well as the projected responsibilities of each of the companies 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we and bayer healthcare reaffirmed the companies commitment to a dme development program and had initial estimates of development costs for vegf trap eye in dme 
as a result  effective in the fourth quarter of  the company determined the appropriate accounting policy for payments from bayer healthcare 
the million up front licensing payment and the million milestone payment which was received in august and not considered substantive from bayer healthcare are being recognized as contract research and development revenue over the related estimated performance period 
in periods when we recognize vegf trap eye development expenses that we incur under the collaboration  we also recognize  as contract research and development revenue  the portion of those vegf trap eye development expenses that is reimbursable from bayer healthcare 
in periods when bayer healthcare incurs agreed upon vegf trap eye development expenses that benefit the collaboration and regeneron  we also recognize  as additional research and development expense  the portion of bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
in the fourth quarter of  we commenced recognizing previously deferred payments from bayer healthcare and cost sharing of our and bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses through a cumulative catch up 
cost sharing of our vegf trap eye development expenses with bayer healthcare decreased in compared to under the terms of the collaboration  in  the first million of agreed upon vegf trap eye development expenses incurred by regeneron and bayer healthcare under a global development plan were shared equally  and we were solely responsible for up to the next million 
since both we and bayer healthcare incurred higher vegf trap eye development expenses in compared to  during the fourth quarter of  we were solely responsible for most of the collaboration s vegf trap eye development expenses  which partly contributed to the revenue decrease in compared to in addition  the decrease was due in part to the cumulative catchup recognized in from the inception of the collaboration in october  as described above 
recognition of deferred revenue related to bayer healthcare s million up front and million milestone payments also decreased in from as a result of the cumulative catch up 
as of december   million of the up front licensing and milestone payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods 
other contract research and development revenue includes million and million  respectively  recognized in connection with our five year grant from the nih  which we were awarded in september as part of the nih s knockout mouse project 
in connection with our velocimmune license agreements with astrazeneca and astellas  each of the million annual  non refundable payments are deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue ratably over approximately the ensuing year of each agreement 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of technology licensing revenue related to these agreements 
for the year ended december   we recognized as revenue million of arcalyst rilonacept net product sales for which both the right of return no longer exists and rebates can be reasonably estimated 
at december   deferred revenue related to arcalyst net product sales totaled million 
expenses total operating expenses increased to million in from million in our average headcount in increased to from in the same period of principally as a result of our expanding research and development activities which are primarily attributable to our antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis

includes million and million of non cash compensation expense for the years ended december  and  respectively 
under our collaboration with bayer healthcare  in periods when bayer healthcare incurs vegf trap eye development expenses  we also recognize  as additional research and development expense  the portion of bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
in the fourth quarter of  we commenced recognizing cost sharing of our and bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses 
payroll and benefits increased principally due to the increase in employee headcount  as described above 
clinical trial expenses increased due primarily to higher costs related to our clinical development programs for i vegf trap eye  which includes our view trial in wet amd  ii arcalyst rilonacept  which includes our phase gout flare prevention clinical study  and iii monoclonal antibodies  which includes regn as well as clinical related preparatory activities for regn clinical manufacturing costs increased due primarily to higher expenses related to vegf trap eye and monoclonal antibodies  including regn these increases were partially offset by a reduction in manufacturing costs associated with arcalyst and aflibercept 
research and preclinical development costs increased primarily due to higher costs associated with our antibody programs 
occupancy and other operating costs increased principally in connection with our higher headcount  expanded research and development activities  and new operating lease for our tarrytown  new york facilities  which commenced in june cost sharing of bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses increased primarily due to higher costs in connection with the view trial in wet amd  which bayer healthcare initiated in we budget our research and development costs by expense category  rather than by project 
we also prepare estimates of research and development cost for projects in clinical development  which include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor  non cash compensation expense  and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects  and  under our collaboration with bayer healthcare  the portion of bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
our estimates of research and development costs for clinical development programs are shown below year ended december  increase project costs decrease in millions arcalyst rilonacept aflibercept vegf trap eye regn other research programs unallocated costs total research and development expenses drug development and approval in the united states is a multi step process regulated by the fda 
the process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation  leading up to the submission of an ind to the fda which  if successful  allows the opportunity for study in humans  or clinical study  of the potential new drug 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase   and the most significant costs in clinical development are in phase clinical trials  as they tend to be the longest and largest studies in the drug development process 
following successful completion of phase clinical trials for a biological product  a biologics license application or bla must be submitted to  and accepted by  the fda  and the fda must approve the bla prior to commercialization of the drug 
it is not uncommon for the fda to request additional data following its review of a bla  which can significantly increase the drug development timeline and expenses 
we may elect either on our own  or at the request of the fda  to conduct further studies that are referred to as phase b and studies 
phase b studies are initiated and either completed or substantially completed while the bla is under fda review 
these studies are conducted under an ind 
phase studies  also referred to as post marketing studies  are studies that are initiated and conducted after the fda has approved a product for marketing 
in addition  as discovery research  preclinical development  and clinical programs progress  opportunities to expand development of drug candidates into new disease indications can emerge 
we may elect to add such new disease indications to our development efforts with the approval of our collaborator for joint development programs  thereby extending the period in which we will be developing a product 
for example  we  and our collaborators  where applicable  continue to explore further development of arcalyst  aflibercept  and vegf trap eye in different disease indications 
there are numerous uncertainties associated with drug development  including uncertainties related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development  uncertainties related to the enrollment and performance of clinical trials  changes in regulatory requirements  changes in the competitive landscape affecting a product candidate  and other risks and uncertainties described in item a  risk factors  under risks related to arcalyst rilonacept and the development of our product candidates  regulatory and litigation risks  and risks related to commercialization of products 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals  and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
for these reasons and due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a product and the uncertainties related to future indications to be studied  the estimated cost and scope of the projects and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
similarly  we are currently unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows 
in the first quarter of  we received fda approval for arcalyst for the treatment of caps  a group of rare  inherited auto inflammatory diseases 
these rare diseases affect a very small group of people 
as a result  we can not predict whether the commercialization of arcalyst in caps will result in a significant net cash benefit to us 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the same period of in  we incurred million of selling expenses related to arcalyst rilonacept for the treatment of caps 
general and administrative expenses increased in due to i higher compensation expense primarily resulting from increases in administrative headcount to support our expanded research and development activities  ii higher recruitment and related costs associated with expanding our headcount  iii higher fees for professional services related to various general corporate matters  and iv higher administrative facility related costs 
cost of goods sold during the year ended december   we began recognizing revenue and cost of goods sold from net product sales of arcalyst 
we began capitalizing inventory costs associated with commercial supplies of arcalyst subsequent to receipt of marketing approval from the fda in february costs for manufacturing supplies of arcalyst prior to receipt of fda approval were recognized as research and development expenses in the period that the costs were incurred 
therefore  these costs are not being included in cost of goods sold when revenue is recognized from the sale of those supplies of arcalyst 
cost of goods sold for was million and consisted primarily of royalties and other period costs related to arcalyst commercial supplies 
other income and expense investment income decreased to million in from million in the  due primarily to lower yields on our cash and marketable securities 
in addition  in and  deterioration in the credit quality of specific marketable securities in our investment portfolio subjected us to the risk of not being able to recover these securities carrying values 
as a result  in and  we recognized charges of million and million related to securities from three issuers and two issuers  respectively  which we considered to be other than temporarily impaired 
in  these charges were partially offset by realized gains of million on sales of marketable securities during the year 
interest expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  was attributable to our convertible senior subordinated notes due october  during the second and third quarters of  we repurchased a total of million in principal amount of these convertible notes for million 
in connection with these repurchases  we recognized a million loss on early extinguishment of debt  representing the premium paid on the notes plus related unamortized debt issuance costs 
the remaining million of convertible notes were repaid in full upon their maturity in october income tax expense in the third quarter of  we implemented a tax planning strategy which resulted in the utilization of certain net operating loss carry forwards  that would otherwise have expired over the next several years  to offset income for tax purposes 
as a result  we incurred and paid income tax expense of million  which relates to us federal and new york state alternative minimum tax and included million of interest and penalties 
this expense was partly offset by a million income tax benefit  resulting from a provision in the housing assistance tax act of that allowed us to claim a refund for a portion of our unused pre research tax credits

as described above  in the fourth quarter of  we commenced recognizing previously deferred payments from bayer healthcare and cost sharing of our and bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses through a cumulative catch up 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we recognized contract research and development revenue of million  consisting of i million related to the million up front licensing payment and the million milestone payment  and ii million related to the portion of our vegf trap eye development expenses that is reimbursable from bayer healthcare 
as of december   million of the up front licensing and milestone payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods 
other contract research and development revenue includes million and million in and  respectively  recognized in connection with our five year grant from the nih  which we were awarded in september as part of the nih s knockout mouse project 
contract manufacturing revenue in related to our long term agreement with merck co  inc  which expired in october  to manufacture a vaccine intermediate at our rensselaer  new york facility 
revenue and the related manufacturing expense were recognized as product was shipped  after acceptance by merck 
included in contract manufacturing revenue in was million of deferred revenue associated with capital improvement reimbursements paid by merck prior to commencement of production 
we do not expect to receive any further contract manufacturing revenue from merck 
in connection with our license agreement with astrazeneca  as described above  the million non refundable  up front payment  which we received in february  was deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the twelve month period beginning in february in connection with our license agreement with astellas  as described above  the million non refundable  up front payment  which we received in april  was deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the twelve month period beginning in june for the year ended december   we recognized million of technology licensing revenue related to these agreements

operating expenses in and include a total of million and million of non cash compensation expense  as detailed below for the year ended december  expenses before inclusion of non cash non cash compensation compensation expenses as expenses expense expense reported in millions research and development selling  general  and administrative total operating expenses for the year ended december  expenses before inclusion of non cash non cash compensation compensation expenses as expenses expense expense reported in millions research and development contract manufacturing selling  general  and administrative total operating expenses the increase in total non cash compensation expense in was primarily due to the higher fair market value of our common stock on the date of our annual employee option grants made in december in comparison to the fair market value of our common stock on the dates of annual employee option grants made in recent prior years 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the following table summarizes the major categories of our research and development expenses for the years ended december  and year ended december  research and development expenses increase in millions payroll and benefits clinical trial expenses clinical manufacturing costs research and preclinical development costs occupancy and other operating costs cost sharing of bayer healthcare vegf trap eye development expenses total research and development includes million and million of non cash compensation expense for the years ended december  and  respectively 
represents the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in research  preclinical development  and clinical trials  including related payroll and benefits  non cash compensation expense  manufacturing materials and supplies  depreciation  and occupancy costs of our rensselaer manufacturing facility 
includes million and million of non cash compensation expense for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  when we commenced recognizing cost sharing of our and bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses  we recognized as additional research and development expense a cumulative catch up of million of vegf trap eye development expenses that we were obligated to reimburse to bayer healthcare 
payroll and benefits increased primarily due to the increase in employee headcount  as described above  annual compensation increases effective in  and higher non cash compensation expense  as described above 
clinical trial expenses increased due primarily to higher costs related to our phase study of vegf trap eye in wet amd  which we initiated in the third quarter of  and our ongoing phase and studies of vegf trap eye in wet amd 
clinical manufacturing costs increased due primarily to higher costs related to manufacturing arcalyst and preclinical and clinical supplies of regn  which were partly offset by lower costs related to manufacturing aflibercept and vegf trap eye 
research and preclinical development costs increased primarily due to higher costs related to our human monoclonal antibody programs  including regn  and utilization of our proprietary technology platforms 
occupancy and other operating costs increased primarily as a result of higher company headcount and our expanded research and development activities 
we budget our research and development costs by expense category  rather than by project 
we also prepare estimates of research and development cost for projects in clinical development  which include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor  non cash compensation expense  and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects  and  under our collaboration with bayer healthcare  the portion of bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
our estimates of research and development costs for clinical development programs are shown below year ended december  project costs increase in millions arcalyst rilonacept aflibercept vegf trap eye regn other research programs unallocated costs total research and development expenses for the reasons described above in results of operations for the years ended december  and  under the caption research and development expenses  and due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a product and the uncertainties related to future indications to be studied  the estimated cost and scope of the projects and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
similarly  we are currently unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows 
in the first quarter of  we received fda approval for arcalyst rilonacept for the treatment of caps  a group of rare  inherited auto inflammatory diseases 
these rare diseases affect a very small group of people 
as a result  we can not predict whether the commercialization of arcalyst in caps will result in a significant net cash benefit to us 
contract manufacturing expenses we had no contract manufacturing expenses in compared to million in  due to the expiration of our manufacturing agreement with merck in october selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the same period of primarily due to i higher non cash compensation expense  as described above  ii higher compensation expense principally due to annual increases effective in and higher administrative headcount to support our expanded research and development activities  iii recruitment and related costs associated with expanding our headcount in  iv higher fees for consultants and other professional services on various corporate matters  and v market research and related expenses incurred in in connection with our arcalyst and vegf trap eye programs 
other income and expense investment income increased to million in from million in  resulting primarily from higher balances of cash and marketable securities due  in part  to the up front payment received from bayer healthcare in october  as described above  and the receipt of net proceeds from the november public offering of our common stock 
this increase was partly offset by a million charge in related to marketable securities which we considered to be other than temporarily impaired in value 
in the second half of  deterioration in the credit quality of marketable securities from two issuers has subjected us to the risk of being unable to recover their full principal value  which totals million 
interest expense was million in and interest expense was attributable primarily to our convertible senior subordinated notes due october liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have financed our operations primarily through offerings of our equity securities  a private placement of convertible debt which was repaid in  purchases of our equity securities by our collaborators  including sanofi aventis  revenue earned under our past and present research and development agreements  including our agreements with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare  our past contract manufacturing agreements  and our technology licensing agreements  arcalyst product revenue  and investment income

our net losses also included depreciation and amortization of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
at december   accounts receivable increased by million  compared to end of year  primarily due to a higher receivable balance related to our antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis 
also  prepaid expenses and other assets increased by million at december  compared to end of year due to a million payment to cellectis sa in july  described below  which is being amortized in proportion to past and anticipated future revenues under our license agreements with astrazeneca and astellas and our antibody discovery agreement with sanofi aventis 
our deferred revenue balances at december  decreased by million  compared to end of year  primarily due to the amortization of previously received deferred payments under our collaborations with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare 
this decrease was partly offset by the deferral of million of arcalyst rilonacept net product sales at december  at december   accounts receivable increased by million compared to end of year due to higher receivable balances related to our collaborations with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare 
also  prepaid expenses and other assets increased million at december  compared to end of year due primarily to higher prepaid clinical trial costs 
our deferred revenue balances at december  increased by million  compared to end of year  due primarily to i the million up front payment received from sanofi aventis  ii the million milestone payment from bayer healthcare which was deemed to be non substantive and fully deferred  and iii the two million up front payments received from each of astrazeneca and astellas  all as described above  partly offset by revenue recognition  principally from amortization of these deferred payments and prior year deferred payments from sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare 
accounts payable  accrued expenses  and other liabilities increased million at december  compared to end of year  primarily due to a million cost sharing payment due to bayer healthcare in connection with the companies vegf trap eye collaboration and higher accruals in for payroll costs and clinical related expenses 
at december   accounts receivable balances decreased by million compared to end of year  due to the january receipt of a million up front payment from sanofi aventis  which was receivable at december   in connection with an amendment to our aflibercept collaboration to include japan  and lower amounts due from sanofi aventis for reimbursement of aflibercept development expenses 
also  our deferred revenue balances at december  increased by million compared to end of year  due primarily to the october million up front payment from bayer  as described above  partly offset by revenue recognition from deferred sanofi aventis up front payments 
the majority of our cash expenditures in   and were to fund research and development  primarily related to our clinical programs and  in and  our preclinical human monoclonal antibody programs 
in   and  we made interest payments totaling million  million  and million  respectively  on our convertible senior subordinated notes 
cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million in  and net cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
in  sales or maturities of marketable securities exceeded purchases by million  whereas in and  purchases of marketable securities exceeded sales or maturities by million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures in include costs in connection with expanding our manufacturing capacity at our rensselaer  new york facilities and tenant improvements and related costs in connection with our december tarrytown  new york operating lease  as described below 
capital expenditures in included the purchase of land and a building in rensselaer for million 
cash used in provided by financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in  and net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
in the second and third quarters of  we repurchased million in principal amount of our convertible senior subordinated notes for million 
the remaining million of convertible notes were repaid in full upon their maturity in october in  sanofi aventis purchased million newly issued  unregistered shares of our common stock for gross proceeds to us of million 
in  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock and received proceeds  after expenses  of million 
in addition  proceeds from issuances of common stock in connection with exercises of employee stock options were million in  million in  and million in fair value of marketable securities at december  and  we held marketable securities whose aggregate fair value totaled million and million  respectively 
the composition of our portfolio of marketable securities on these dates was as follows investment type fair value percent fair value percent us treasury securities us government agency securities us government guaranteed corporate bonds us government guaranteed collateralized mortgage obligations corporate bonds asset backed securities commercial paper other total marketable securities in addition  at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash  primarily held in money market funds that invest in us government securities 
during  as marketable securities in our portfolio matured or paid down  we purchased primarily us treasury securities  us government agency obligations and us government guaranteed debt 
this shift toward higher quality securities reduced the risk profile  as well as the overall yield  of our portfolio during in particular  we reduced the proportion of asset backed securities in the portfolio as they deteriorated in credit quality and declined in value due to higher delinquency rates on the underlying collateral supporting these securities 
of the million of asset backed securities that we held at december   million were backed by prime and sub prime residential mortgages and home equity loans 
the remaining million were backed by automotive loans and credit card receivables  of which one million security matured in february the estimated fair value of our asset backed securities generally ranged from to of par value at december  we purchased these securities in early when they were all rated triple a by at least one of the major rating agencies 
in addition  our asset backed securities are all senior tranches that are paid down before other subordinated tranches as the loans in the underlying collateral are repaid 
through december   we continued to receive monthly payments of principal and interest on our asset backed securities holdings 
if the monthly principal and interest payments continue at approximately the current rate  we anticipate that all of the asset backed securities in our portfolio will be repaid within the next two years  and most would be repaid in however  further deterioration of the current economic environment and or higher delinquency rates in the underlying collateral supporting an asset backed security in our investment portfolio could result in future impairment charges related to these securities  which could be material 
in addition  we reduced the proportion of corporate bonds in our portfolio from at december  to at december   due to the deterioration of the credit quality of many corporate bond issuers 
at the end of  we held million of corporate bonds issued by financial services companies  of which million matured in january and another million are scheduled to mature by the end of during  we recognized other than temporary impairment charges of million related to corporate securities in our portfolio 
further deterioration in the credit quality of financial services companies whose debt we hold could result in additional impairment charges  which could be material 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we adopted the provisions of sfas as of january   for financial instruments 
although the adoption of sfas did not materially impact our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows  we are now required to provide additional disclosures as part of our financial statements 
in addition  in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  which clarifies the application of sfas in a market that is not active 
fsp also reaffirms the notion of fair value as an exit price as of the measurement date 
fsp was effective upon issuance for financial statements that had not yet been issued 
we adopted fsp for the quarter ended september  sfas establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
the three tiers are level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
we have determined that the provisions of sfas are applicable to our marketable securities  which totaled million as of december  at december   less than of our marketable securities represented level assets 
changes in level marketable securities during the year ended december  were as follows level marketable in millions securities balance january  settlements realized gain impairments balance december  during the year ended december   there were no transfers of marketable securities between level and level classifications 
our methods for valuing our marketable securities are described in note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
with respect to valuations for pricing our level marketable securities  we consider quantitative and qualitative factors such as financial conditions and near term prospects of the issuer  recommendations of the investment advisors and forecasts of economic  market  or industry trends 
we also review our investment advisors policies and procedures for valuation and  for a sample of valuations  review the inputs supporting the valuations and independently test the valuations through the use of an alternative third party vendor 
for valuations that we determine for our level marketable securities  we regularly monitor these securities and adjust their valuations as deemed appropriate based on the facts and circumstances

excludes future contingent rental costs for utilities  real estate taxes  and operating expenses 
in  these costs were million 
purchase obligations primarily relate to i research and development commitments  including those related to clinical trials  ii capital expenditures for equipment acquisitions  and iii license payments 
our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may increase or be reduced based on certain future events 
open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table above 
under our collaboration with bayer healthcare  over the next several years we and bayer healthcare will share agreed upon vegf trap eye development expenses incurred by both companies  under a global development plan  as described above 
in addition  under our collaboration agreements with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare  if the applicable collaboration becomes profitable  we have contingent contractual obligations to reimburse sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare for a defined percentage generally of agreed upon development expenses incurred by sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare  respectively 
profitability under each collaboration will be measured by calculating net sales less agreed upon expenses 
these reimbursements would be deducted from our share of the collaboration profits and  for our aflibercept collaboration with sanofi aventis  royalties on product sales in japan otherwise payable to us unless we agree to reimburse these expenses at a faster rate at our option 
given the uncertainties related to drug development including the development of aflibercept and co developed antibody candidates in collaboration with sanofi aventis and vegf trap eye in collaboration with bayer healthcare such as the variability in the length of time necessary to develop a product candidate and the ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  we are currently unable to reliably estimate if our collaborations with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare will become profitable 
the amount we need to fund operations will depend on various factors  including the status of competitive products  the success of our research and development programs  the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities  the status of patents and other intellectual property rights  the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug candidates  and the continuation  extent  and success of our collaborations with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare 
clinical trial costs are dependent  among other things  on the size and duration of trials  fees charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties  the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials  and for supplies  laboratory tests  and other expenses 
the amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and early stage clinical trials  regulatory requirements  the duration and results of clinical trials underway and of additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate  and the various factors that affect the cost of each trial as described above 
currently  we are required to remit royalties on product sales of arcalyst rilonacept for the treatment of caps 
in the future  if we are able to successfully develop  market  and sell arcalyst for other indications or certain of our product candidates  we may be required to pay royalties or otherwise share the profits generated on such sales in connection with our collaboration and licensing agreements 
we expect that expenses related to the filing  prosecution  defense  and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims will continue to be substantial as a result of patent filings and prosecutions in the united states and foreign countries 
we believe that our existing capital resources  including funding we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements  will enable us to meet operating needs through at least however  this is a forward looking statement based on our current operating plan  and there may be a change in projected revenues or expenses that would lead to our capital being consumed significantly before such time 
if there is insufficient capital to fund all of our planned operations and activities  we believe we would prioritize available capital to fund preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates 
other than letters of credit totaling million  including a million letter of credit issued to our landlord in connection with our operating lease for facilities in tarrytown  new york  as described above  we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
in addition  we do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity 
as of december   we had no established banking arrangements through which we could obtain short term financing or a line of credit 
in the event we need additional financing for the operation of our business  we will consider collaborative arrangements and additional public or private financing  including additional equity financing 
factors influencing the availability of additional financing include our progress in product development  investor perception of our prospects  and the general condition of the financial markets 
we may not be able to secure the necessary funding through new collaborative arrangements or additional public or private offerings 
if we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements  we may have to delay  scale back  or eliminate certain of our research and development activities or future operations 
this could materially harm our business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from our investment of available cash balances in us government  corporate  and asset backed securities 
we do not believe we are materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we estimated that a one percent unfavorable change in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio at both december  and credit quality risk we have an investment policy that includes guidelines on acceptable investment securities  minimum credit quality  maturity parameters  and concentration and diversification 
nonetheless  deterioration of the credit quality of an investment security subsequent to purchase may subject us to the risk of not being able to recover the full principal value of the security 
in the second half of  we recognized a million charge related to marketable securities from two issuers which we considered to be other than temporarily impaired in value 
in  an additional million impairment charge was recognized related to one of these securities and a million charge was recognized related to another marketable security which we considered to be other than temporarily impaired in value
