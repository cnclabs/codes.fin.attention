item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are engaged in the discovery and development of dna and rna based drug candidates targeted to toll like receptors  or tlrs  to treat infectious diseases  autoimmune and inflammatory diseases  cancer  and asthma and allergies  and for use as vaccine adjuvants 
drug candidates are compounds that we are developing and have not 
table of contents been approved for any commercial use 
tlrs are specific receptors present in immune system cells that recognize the dna or rna of pathogens such as bacteria or viruses and initiate an immune response 
relying on our expertise in dna and rna chemistry  we have designed and created proprietary tlr agonists and antagonists to modulate immune responses 
a tlr agonist is a compound that stimulates an immune response through the targeted tlr 
a tlr antagonist is a compound that blocks activation of an immune response through the targeted tlr 
our business strategy is to advance applications of our tlr targeted drug candidates in multiple disease areas simultaneously 
we are advancing some of these applications through internal programs  and we seek to advance other applications through collaborative alliances with pharmaceutical companies 
collaborators provide the necessary resources and drug development experience to advance our compounds in their programs 
upfront payments and milestone payments received from collaborations help to provide us with the financial resources for our internal research and development programs 
our internal programs are focused on developing tlr targeted drug candidates for the potential treatment of infectious diseases  autoimmune and inflammatory diseases  and cancer 
imo  a tlr agonist  is our lead drug candidate for infectious diseases 
we are conducting a phase clinical trial of imo in patients with chronic hepatitis c virus  or hcv  infection who have not responded to current standard of care therapy 
we also plan to conduct a clinical trial of imo in combination with ribavirin in treatment na ve patients with chronic hcv infection 
as part of our infectious disease program  we are also evaluating rna based compounds that act as agonists of tlr and or tlr we have evaluated the mechanism of action of our tlr and tlr agonist compounds in preclinical studies in human cell based assays and in vivo in non human primates 
in our autoimmune and inflammatory disease program  we have identified dna based compounds that act as antagonists of tlr and tlr we have evaluated these compounds in mouse models of lupus  rheumatoid arthritis  multiple sclerosis  psoriasis  colitis  and pulmonary inflammation 
we have selected imo as a lead tlr antagonist drug candidate  and are currently conducting preclinical development studies in anticipation of submitting an investigational new drug  or ind  application to the united states food and drug administration  or fda  by the end of our cancer treatment research program is focused on potential applications of our tlr and or tlr agonists 
we are studying our tlr and tlr agonists in preclinical models of cancer and have observed antitumor activity monotherapy and in combination with selected targeted agents 
we are also collaborating with three pharmaceutical companies to advance our tlr targeted compounds in additional disease areas 
we are collaborating with merck kgaa for cancer treatment excluding cancer vaccines  with merck co  for vaccine adjuvants  and with novartis international pharmaceutical  ltd  or novartis  for treatment of asthma and allergies 
merck kgaa and merck co 
are not related 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we may incur substantial operating losses in future periods 
we do not expect to generate significant funds until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for products  either alone or in collaborations with third parties  which we expect will take a number of years 
in order to commercialize our products  we need to address a number of technological challenges and to comply with comprehensive regulatory requirements 
in  we expect that our research and development expenses will be higher than our research and development expenses in as we expand our imo development program  conduct ind enabling preclinical evaluations of imo and accelerate our early stage programs on tlr antagonists and on agonists of tlr and tlr critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various 
table of contents other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
not all of these significant policies  however  fit the definition of critical accounting policies and estimates 
we believe that our accounting policies relating to revenue recognition and stock based compensation fit the description of critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition our corporate strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development agreements with pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the terms of our agreements have included non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of clinical and preclinical development milestones and royalties on product sales 
we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission  or sec  staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  that requires four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  services have been rendered or obligations have been satisfied  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of the last three criteria are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered or products delivered and the collectibility of these fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for any future transactions  revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements  the company considers whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting as defined in emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue from non refundable upfront fees received under collaboration agreements  not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the term of our contractual obligation or our estimated continuing involvement under the research arrangement 
if the estimated period of continuing involvement is subsequently modified  the period over which the up front fee is recognized is modified accordingly on a prospective basis 
we recognize revenue from reimbursements received in connection with our research and development collaboration agreements as related research and development costs are incurred  and our contractual services are performed  provided collectability is reasonably assured 
amounts contractually owed us under these research and development collaboration agreements  including any earned but unbilled receivables  are included in trade accounts receivable in our balance sheets 
our principal costs under these agreements are generally for our personnel and related expenses of conducting research and development  as well as for research and development performed by outside contractors or consultants 
for payments that are specifically associated with a separate earnings process  we recognize revenue when the specific performance obligation is completed 
performance obligations typically consist of significant milestones in 
table of contents the development life cycle of the related technology  such as initiating clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies and obtaining approvals from regulatory agencies 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments received under collaboration agreements when earned  provided that the milestone event is substantive  its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  we have no further performance obligations relating to the event and collectability is reasonable assured 
in the event that the agreement provides for payment to be made subsequent to our standard payment terms  revenue is recognized when payment is received 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
amounts not expected to be recognized within the next twelve months are classified as long term deferred revenue 
as of december   we have short term and long term deferred revenue of million and million  respectively  related to our collaborations 
although we follow detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
for example  in connection with our existing collaboration agreements  we have recorded on our balance sheet short term and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
short term deferred revenue consists of amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue in the next twelve months 
amounts that we expect will not be recognized prior to the next twelve months are classified as long term deferred revenue 
however  this estimate is based on our collaboration agreements and our current operating plan and  if either should change in the future  we may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the next twelve month period 
the estimate of deferred revenue also reflects management s estimate of the periods of our involvement in our collaborations and the estimated periods over which our performance obligations will be completed 
in some instances  the timing of satisfying these obligations can be difficult to estimate 
accordingly  our estimates may change in the future 
such changes to estimates would result in a change in revenue recognition amounts 
if these estimates and judgments change over the course of these agreements  it may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize and record in future periods 
stock based compensation we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  on january  this statement requires us to recognize all share based payments to employees as expense in the financial statements based on their fair values 
under sfas no 
r  we are required to record compensation expense over an award s vesting period based on the award s fair value at the date of grant 
our policy is to charge the fair value of stock options as an expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we are also required to record compensation cost for the non vested portion of previously granted stock based awards outstanding at the date of adoption over the requisite service periods for the individual awards based on the fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
adjusted for forfeitures as required by sfas r 
as permitted under sfas r  we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants 
the black scholes model relies on a number of key assumptions to calculate estimated fair values  including average risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected life and expected volatility 
the assumed risk free interest rate is the us treasury security rate with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
our assumed dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends to common stockholders and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
for options granted during and  the assumed expected option life is based on the average of the option term and the option vesting period for standard options which meet the sec s staff accounting bulletin criteria for utilizing this simplified method and based on actual experience of options held by employees holding options with similar characteristics for those options that do not meet the sec s criteria for using the simplified method 
for options granted after december   the assumed expected option life is based on actual experience 
the expected volatility assumption is based on the actual stock price volatility over a period equal to the expected life of the option 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
it may also result in a lack of 
table of contents comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  issued eitf  accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property  or eitf eitf defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in collaborative arrangements and between participants in the arrangement and third parties 
eitf states that such participants in collaborative arrangements shall report costs incurred and revenue generated from transactions with third parties that is  parties that do not participate in the arrangement in each entity s respective income statement 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and must be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
we are currently evaluating the effect of eitf on our financial statements 
in june  the eitf issued eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  or eitf eitf clarifies the accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for research and development activities 
eitf states that such payments should be capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or the services rendered  the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense 
we adopted eitf on january  the adoption of eitf did not have a material effect on our financial statements for the year ended december  results of operations years ended december   and alliance revenue our alliance revenues were comprised primarily of revenue earned under various collaboration and licensing agreements including license fees  research and development revenues  including reimbursement of internal and third party expenses  and milestones 
the following is a summary of our alliance revenues year ended december  annual percentage change in millions license fees research and development milestones total alliance revenue total revenues increased by million  or  from million in to million in and increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in license fees primarily include license fee revenue recognized under our collaborations with merck kgaa  merck co  and novartis 
license fee revenue is comprised of a portion of upfront license fee payments and a research period extension payment we have received from collaborative alliances with which we are still involved 
license fee revenue is recognized over the period of our continuing involvement in the collaboration which generally represents the estimated research period of the agreement 
we received a million upfront payment from merck kgaa in february of which we received million due to foreign currency exchange rates and 
table of contents a million upfront payment from merck co 
in december we also received a million upfront payment from novartis in july and an additional million payment  to extend the research portion of the agreement  from novartis in may license fees increased by million in compared to primarily due to million in license fee revenue we recognized under our collaboration with merck kgaa  which became effective february  this increase was partially offset by a decrease in license fee revenue recognized under our may research collaboration with novartis which decreased by million during when our research obligations under this collaboration were completed 
we also recognized million per year in license fee revenue under our collaboration with merck co 
during both and license fees increased by million in compared to primarily due to a million increase in license fee revenue recognized under our december collaboration agreement with merck co 
which reflects a full year of license fee revenue recognized during this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in license fee revenue recognized under our collaboration agreement with novartis which decreased from million in to million in the increase in research and development revenue in is due to reimbursable clinical trial costs associated with clinical trials we are conducting under our collaboration agreement with merck kgaa 
the increase in is also attributable to the purchase of our bulk imo drug supply by merck kgaa at cost and increased reimbursable research costs attributable to expanding research under our merck co 
collaboration agreement 
the increase in research and development revenues in is primarily attributable to revenue from research reimbursements under our collaboration agreement with merck co 
the increase in alliance revenue in is also attributable to milestone revenue of million earned under our collaboration with novartis relating to an initiation of a phase clinical trial by novartis and milestone revenue of million earned under our collaboration with merck co 
relating to a preclinical milestone achieved by merck co 
with one of our novel tlr agonists used as an adjuvant in a cancer vaccine under preclinical study 
in  we earned a milestone under another collaboration agreement 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increased nonclinical safety studies and clinical costs associated with our ongoing clinical trial of imo  increased costs for nonclinical safety studies associated with imo  increased research expenses under our merck co 
agreement  which merck co 
has agreed to reimburse  and increased imo clinical trial expenses under our merck kgaa agreement  which merck kgaa has agreed to reimburse 
these increases were offset  in part  by decreases in expenses in related to our phase clinical trial of imo combined with gemcitabine and carboplatin in patients with solid tumor cancers and to our phase stage a clinical trial of imo as a monotherapy in patients with metastatic or recurrent clear cell renal cancer 
the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increases in clinical and nonclinical trial costs for imo  increased research expenses under our merck co 
agreement  which merck co 
has agreed to reimburse  costs associated with hiring additional drug development employees and stock based compensation 
the increase was offset  in part  by lower ind enabling external expenses related to imo and a decrease in imo external development expenses 
the figures in the table below with respect to imo exclude all amounts incurred by our collaborator  merck kgaa 

table of contents year ended december  annual percentage change in millions imo external development expense imo external development expense other drug development expense basic discovery expense total research and development expense in the preceding table  research and development expense is set forth in the following four categories imo external development expenses 
imo is a lead compound being developed for oncology applications under our collaboration with merck kgaa that we entered into in december these external expenses include payments to independent contractors and vendors for drug development activities conducted after the initiation of imo clinical trials but exclude internal costs such as payroll and overhead expenses 
since  when we commenced clinical development of imo  we have incurred approximately million in external expenses through december  in connection with imo imo external development expenses were consistent between and and decreased by million  or  from million in to million in in  clinical trial expenses related to our phase clinical trial of imo combined with gemcitabine and carboplatin in patients with solid tumor cancers and our phase stage a clinical trial of imo as a monotherapy in patients with metastatic or recurrent clear cell renal cancer decreased from this decrease was offset by increased clinical trial expenses in associated with the phase b clinical trial of imo combined with avastin and tarceva in patients with non small cell lung cancer which was initiated in december as well as clinical trial expenses associated with the phase b clinical trial of imo in combination with erbitux and camptosar in patients with colorectal cancer  for which we commenced dosing in february the decrease in imo expenses in compared to was primarily attributable to lower clinical trial expenses as we closed enrollment of our phase stage a clinical trial of imo as a monotherapy in patients with metastatic or recurrent clear cell renal cancer in june and of our phase clinical trial of imo combined with gemcitabine and carboplatin in patients with solid tumor cancers in july and to a decrease in nonclinical safety studies of imo these decreases were partially offset by increases associated with our phase b clinical trial of imo combined with avastin and tarceva in patients with non small cell lung cancer that we commenced in in december  we initiated a phase b clinical trial of imo in combination with avastin and tarceva in non small cell lung cancer patients whose cancer had progressed during a prior course of standard therapy 
patients currently are being recruited for this clinical trial  which was designed with a target enrollment of up to patients 
in february  we began dosing the first patient in a phase b clinical trial of imo in combination with erbitux and camptosar in patients with colorectal cancer whose cancer had progressed during a prior course of standard therapy 
patients currently are being recruited for this clinical trial  which was designed with a target enrollment of up to patients 
we reported preliminary data from a phase stage a clinical trial of imo monotherapy in renal cell carcinoma in october the study contained four arms  comprised of treatment na ve and second line patients randomly assigned to receive imo subcutaneously at either mg kg week or mg kg week 
the primary objective of tumor response based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors  or recist  was not achieved in the study 
median progression free survival for each of the four arms of the study was months  months  months  and months 
imo treatment was generally well tolerated with good dose intensity in all arms of the study 
we intend to present data from this clinical trial at a scientific conference in the second half of 
table of contents prior to entering our collaboration with merck kgaa  we conducted three previous phase clinical trials of imo these studies included a rising dose trial in healthy volunteers  a rising dose trial in advanced cancer patients  and a combination trial of imo with the chemotherapy agents gemcitabine and carboplatin in advanced cancer patients 
we closed enrollment in the phase clinical trial of imo in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin in july and reported interim results in september we have agreed with merck kgaa that we will continue to conduct on its behalf the on going phase b non small cell lung cancer trial and the on going phase b colorectal cancer trial 
we may initiate and conduct on behalf of merck kgaa additional clinical trials of imo merck kgaa has agreed to reimburse us for costs associated with these two phase b clinical trials that we incur after february   which is the date our agreement with merck kgaa became effective  and with any additional trials that we may initiate and conduct 
approximately million of expenses in related to the phase b combination clinical trial in patients with non small cell lung cancer and the phase b combination clinical trial in patients with colorectal cancer are reimbursable by merck kgaa 
imo external development expenses 
these expenses include external expenses that we have incurred in connection with imo  our lead compound initially being developed for chronic hcv infection 
these external expenses reflect payments to independent contractors and vendors for drug development activities conducted after the initiation of imo clinical development but exclude internal costs such as payroll and overhead expenses 
we commenced clinical development of imo in may and since then we have incurred approximately million in external development expenses through december   including costs associated with the initiation of our phase clinical trial and related nonclinical studies and manufacturing and related process development 
external development expenses for imo increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase in imo expenses in compared to was primarily attributable to manufacturing imo  our phase clinical trial of imo  which we commenced in september  and costs for nonclinical safety studies of imo initiated after the may submission to the fda of the imo ind application 
in september  we initiated a phase study of imo in patients with chronic hcv infection who have not responded to the current standard of care therapy 
we are currently recruiting patients and plan to enroll up to patients in four cohorts at escalating imo dose levels  with four weeks of treatment 
of the ten patients per cohort  eight will be randomized to receive imo treatment and two will be randomized to receive placebo treatment 
the trial is designed to assess the safety of imo at each dose level 
in addition  the trial is designed to evaluate the effects of imo on hcv rna levels and on parameters of immune system activation 
in this trial  we are enrolling the first five patients per cohort sequentially and allowing each patient to complete at least two weekly injections prior to enrollment of the next patient 
following a safety review of these first five patients in each cohort  the remaining patients of the cohort are enrolled 
due to this enrollment procedure  completion of each cohort has taken longer than anticipated 
currently  we are recruiting patients into the third cohort of the trial 
we currently expect interim results from this trial will be available late in in addition to the on going phase clinical trial of imo in hcv patients who have not responded to standard of care therapy  we also plan to conduct a clinical trial to assess the safety of imo in combination with ribavirin in treatment na ve patients with chronic hcv infection 
this clinical trial also will be designed to evaluate the effects of imo and ribavirin combination treatment on hcv rna levels and on parameters of immune system activation other drug development expenses 
these expenses include internal and external expenses associated with preclinical development of identified compounds in anticipation of advancing these compounds into clinical development in addition to internal costs associated with products in clinical development 
the internal and external expenses associated with preclinical compounds include payments to contract vendors for manufacturing and the related stability studies  preclinical studies including animal toxicology and pharmacology studies and professional fees  as well as payroll and overhead 
the internal expenses associated with 
table of contents products in clinical development include costs associated with our hepatitis c clinical advisory board  our oncology clinical advisory board  our autoimmune disease scientific advisory board  payroll and overhead 
other drug development expenses were consistent between and and decreased by million  or  from million in to million in in  we had a decrease in expenses attributable to lower payroll expenses resulting from fewer full time equivalent positions associated with and allocated to preclinical and clinical development and a decrease in imo expenses due to attribution of imo expenses incurred after commencement of clinical development in may to the imo external development expense category shown separately above 
this decrease in other drug development expenses in was partially offset by increased costs associated with nonclinical safety studies associated with imo and other compounds 
the decrease in from was primarily due to decreases in manufacturing and other pre ind direct external expenses related to imo in the decrease is computed based on imo costs incurred only through april since costs incurred after the may submission of the imo ind have been shown separately in the above table 
the decrease in other drug development expenses during was offset  in part  by costs associated with the hiring of additional drug development employees  increased stock based compensation and allocated costs associated with the move to our new facility during the second quarter of we had direct external expenses of approximately million related to imo we had direct external expenses of approximately million and million related to imo  before we commenced clinical development  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
basic discovery expenses 
these expenses include our internal and external expenses relating to the discovery and development in our tlr targeted programs  including agonists and antagonists of tlrs  and these expenses reflect payments for laboratory supplies  external research  and professional fees  as well as payroll and overhead 
basic discovery expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in and increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase in expense in compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in payroll expenses  expenses  laboratory supplies and allocated costs relating to work under our merck co 
collaboration and higher stock based compensation expense for employees 
the increase in as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in payroll expenses  laboratory supplies and allocated costs relating to work under our merck co 
collaboration and allocated costs associated with the move to our new facility during the second quarter of we do not know if we will be successful in developing any drug candidate from our research and development programs 
at this time  without knowing the results of our ongoing clinical trials and without an established plan for future clinical tests of drug candidates  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of  or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows may commence from  any drug candidate from our research and development programs 
moreover  the clinical development of any drug candidate from our research and development programs is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary expense  stock compensation expense  consulting fees and professional legal fees associated  in part  with our patent applications and maintenance  our regulatory filing requirements  and business development 
the million increase from to primarily reflects higher employee stock compensation expense  higher consulting fees associated with corporate business strategic initiatives undertaken in and higher patent filing and preparation costs 
the increase in stock compensation expense was  in the year ended december  and was primarily the result of stock compensation expenses associated with employee stock options granted in when our stock price was higher than in previous years 
these increases were offset  in part  by lower corporate legal expenses  lower payroll expenses as a result of our former president s resignation at the end 
table of contents of and no costs related to the transition agreement entered into with our former chief financial officer in may the million increase from to primarily reflects increased employee costs  higher stock based compensation expense for employees and consultants  higher professional fees associated with marketing research and legal services including legal expenses in connection with the merck kgaa collaboration signed in december  implementation of sarbanes oxley section requirements  costs associated with the move to our new facility and costs accrued in anticipation of payments to be made to our former chief financial officer under the transition agreement entered into with him in may the increase in stock compensation expense was  in and was primarily the result of stock compensation expenses associated with non employee and employee stock options 
investment income  net investment income decreased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in is primarily attributable to lower interest rates on our money market funds and lower yields on our investments 
the increase in is primarily attributable to higher cash and investment balances 
interest expense interest expense was consistent from to and decreased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in the year ended december  reflects our march repayment in full of our note payable to general electric capital corporation  or ge  and a prepayment premium associated with the note repayment 
as a result of our repayment  the note was cancelled 
the decrease in was attributable to the conversion of all of our notes  issued in may  in the aggregate principal amount of approximately  into  shares of common stock on february  a full year of interest and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our convertible notes was included in the decrease in is partially offset by interest expense associated with our note payable to ge 
income tax expense in  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately  related to refundable research and experimental tax credits 
in  we recorded approximately  as income tax expense as a result of income subject to the alternative minimum tax 
we did not have income subject to the alternative minimum tax for the years ended or foreign currency exchange loss foreign currency exchange loss was million in in february  merck kgaa paid us a million upfront license fee denominated in euros 
we received million us dollars due to foreign currency exchange rates in effect at the time we received the payment  which resulted in the foreign currency exchange loss 
there was no foreign currency exchange loss for the years and net income loss applicable to common stockholders as a result of the factors discussed above  we had net income applicable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december  and a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december  we have incurred losses of million since january  we incurred net losses of million prior to december  during which time we were involved in the development of antisense technology 
since our inception  we had an accumulated deficit of million through december  we may incur substantial operating losses in future periods 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had cumulative net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million available to reduce federal and state taxable income which expire through and  
table of contents respectively 
in addition  we had cumulative federal and state tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to reduce federal and state income taxes  which expire through and  respectively 
the tax reform act of contains provisions  which limit the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards that companies may utilize in any one year in the event of cumulative changes in ownership over a three year period in excess of 
we have completed several financings since the effective date of the tax reform act of  which as of december   have resulted in ownership changes in excess of  as defined under the act and that may significantly limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we have not prepared an analysis to determine the effect of the ownership change limitation on our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
ownership changes in future periods may place additional limits on our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we require cash to fund our operating expenses  to make capital expenditures and to pay debt service 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through the following equity and debt financing  license fees and research funding under collaborative and license agreements  interest income  and lease financings 
during  we received total proceeds of million from purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and warrant and stock option exercises  including the exercises of the august warrants and the may warrant discussed below 
in june  we sent notice to the holder of a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock that was issued in may with an expiration date of may   or the may warrant  that under the terms of the warrant agreement  we intended to redeem on september  the may warrant if not exercised as of that date for a redemption price of per share of common stock underlying the may warrant 
we were entitled to exercise this redemption right because the closing price of our common stock for twenty consecutive trading days ending june  was greater than or of the exercise price of the warrant 
the may warrant was exercisable by cash payment only and had an exercise price of per share of common stock 
following the june notice of redemption  we received approximately  in proceeds from the exercise of the may warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the may warrant was exercised in september in january  we sent notice to holders of warrants to purchase our common stock that were issued in august with an expiration date of august   or the august warrants  that under the terms of the warrant agreement  we intended to redeem on march  any august warrants not exercised as of that date for a redemption price of per share of common stock underlying the august warrants 
we were entitled to exercise this redemption right because the closing price of our common stock for twenty consecutive trading days ending december  was greater than or of the exercise price of the warrant 
the august warrants were exercisable by cash payment only and had an exercise price of per share of common stock 
following the january notice of redemption and through march   we received approximately million in proceeds from the exercise of august warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
as of december   all august warrants had been exercised in full 
in december  we entered into an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with merck kgaa to research  develop and commercialize products containing our tlr agonists for the treatment of cancer  excluding cancer vaccines 
under the terms of the agreement  in february merck kgaa paid us a million upfront license fee in euros of which we received million due to foreign currency exchange rates 

table of contents in june  we executed a promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of million in favor of ge 
the promissory note was secured by specific laboratory  manufacturing  office and computer equipment and was subject to the terms of a master security agreement between us and ge 
the promissory note bore interest at a fixed rate of per annum  and was payable in consecutive monthly installments of principal and accrued interest  with the first installment having been paid out of the proceeds of the borrowing 
in march  we paid approximately million to ge as payment in full of all obligations outstanding under our promissory note with ge 
the payment represented approximately million of principal amount outstanding plus accrued interest through the date of payment and a prepayment premium of approximately million 
the note was cancelled 
in december  we entered into an exclusive license and research collaboration agreement with merck co 
to research  develop  and commercialize vaccine products containing our tlr  and agonists in the fields of cancer  infectious diseases  and alzheimer s disease 
under the terms of the agreement  merck co 
paid us a million license fee in december in addition  in connection with the execution of the license and collaboration agreement  we issued and sold to merck co 
 shares of our common stock for a price of per share resulting in an aggregate purchase price of million 
in march  we raised approximately million in gross proceeds from a private placement to institutional investors

table of contents funding requirements we have incurred operating losses in all fiscal years except and  and we had an accumulated deficit of million at december  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  we believe that based on our current operating plan our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through december  we may incur substantial operating losses in future periods 
these losses  among other things  have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity  total assets and working capital 
we have received no revenues from the sale of drugs 
to date  almost all of our revenues have been from collaboration and license agreements 
we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development  including clinical trials  and we have not completed development of any drugs 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses  whether or when any of our products will become commercially available  or when we will become profitable  if at all 
we do not expect to generate significant additional funds internally until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for products  either alone or in collaboration with third parties  which we expect will take a number of years 
in addition  we have no committed external sources of funds 
we believe that the key factors that will affect our internal and external sources of cash are the success of our clinical and preclinical development programs  the success of our existing strategic collaborations with merck kgaa  merck co 
and novartis  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the receptivity of the capital markets to financings by biotechnology companies  and our ability to enter into new strategic collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and the success of such collaborations 
in addition  increases in expenses or delays in clinical development may adversely impact our cash position and require further cost reductions 
additional financing may not be available to us when we need it or may not be available to us on favorable terms 
we could be required to seek funds through collaborative alliances or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  drug candidates or drugs that we would otherwise pursue on our own 
in addition  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our then existing stockholders will experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends  and are likely to include rights that are senior to the holders of our common stock 
any additional debt financing or equity that we raise may contain terms  such as liquidation and other preferences  or liens or other restrictions on our assets  which are not favorable to us or our stockholders 
the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of existing stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funding on a timely basis or at all  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our discovery or development programs and possibly relinquish rights to portions of our technology or products
