table of contents elimination of the ffel program by the federal government would have a significant negative effect on the company s earnings and operations 
elimination of the ffel program would significantly impact the company s operations and profitability by  among other things  reducing the company s interest revenues as a result of the inability to add new ffelp loans to the company s portfolio and reducing guarantee and third party servicing fees as a result of reduced ffelp loan servicing and origination volume 
additionally  the elimination of the ffel program would reduce education loan software sales and related consulting fees received from lenders using the company s software products and services 
on february   the president introduced several proposals related to the fiscal year federal budget  including a proposal for the elimination of the ffel program and a recommendation that all new student loan originations be funded through the direct loan program  with loan servicing to be provided by private sector companies through performance based contracts with the department 
the proposal did not contain specific details as to implementation or timing  and the proposal is subject to review by congress and possible changes 
the company cannot currently predict whether this or any other proposals to eliminate the ffel program will ultimately be enacted 
utilization by lenders of the department s participation and purchase program could reduce servicing  default aversion  and collection revenue 
on july   pursuant to the ecasla  the department announced terms under which it will offer to purchase certain ffelp student loans and participation interests in certain ffelp student loans from ffelp lenders 
under the department s purchase program  the department will purchase loans at a price equal to the sum of i par value  ii accrued interest  iii the one percent origination fee paid to the department  and iv a fixed amount of per loan 
lenders will have until september  to sell loans to the department under the academic year purchase program 
on october   legislation was enacted to extend the department s authority to address ffelp student loans made for the academic year and allowing for the replication of the participation program and purchase program for the academic year 
lenders will have until september  to sell academic year loans to the department 
ffelp student loans purchased by the department through the purchase program may be serviced by the department  consequently reducing the size of the ffel program third party servicing market 
use of the purchase program by the company and its third party servicing clients will likely reduce future third party servicing and will reduce guaranty revenue 
operating segments fee based businesses the following risk factors relate to the company s operating segments not directly related to the ffel program 
these operating segments include tuition payment processing and campus commerce enrollment services software and technical services changes in legislation and regulations could have a negative impact upon the company s business and may affect its profitability 
changes to privacy and direct mail legislation could negatively impact the company  in particular the company s list management and lead generation activities 
changes in such legislation could restrict the company s ability to collect information for its list management and lead generation activities and its ability to use the information it collects 
the company has a privacy policy that covers how certain subsidiaries collect  protect  and use personal information 
depending on the department  product  and or other factors  certain entities may have more restrictive information handling practices 
the company s software and technical services operating segment provides information technology products and services  with core areas of business in student loan software solutions for schools  lenders  and guarantors 
many of the company s customers receiving these services have been negatively impacted through reduced margins as a result of the passage of the college cost reduction act in september and the recent disruption in the financial markets 
this impact could decrease the demand for the company s products and services and affect the company s revenue and profit margins 
the company s results are affected by competitive conditions  economic changes  and customer preferences 
demand for the company s products and services  which impact revenue and profit margins  is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products and services  ii the company s response to pricing pressures to stay competitive  iii changes in customer discretionary spending based on economic conditions  and iv changes in customers preferences for the company s products and services  including the success of products and services offered by competitors 
in addition  k and post secondary enrollment numbers impact the demand for the company s products and services 
education enrollment numbers are impacted by general population trends and the general state of the economy 
revenue in the company s fee based businesses is recurring only to the extent that customer relationships are sustained 
for some products and services  volume and growth is concentrated to a limited number of customers 
reduction in volume or loss of key customer relationships could have a negative impact on the company s future operating results 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company faces liquidity and funding risk to meet its financial obligations 
liquidity and funding risk refers to the risk that the company will be unable to finance its operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or other financing alternatives  or difficulty in raising financing needed for its assets 
liquidity and funding risk also encompasses the ability of the company to meet its financial obligations without experiencing significant business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten its viability as a going concern 
the recent unprecedented disruptions in the credit and financial markets and the general economic crisis have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the cost and availability of financing for the company s student loan portfolios and  as a result  have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the company s liquidity  results of operations  and financial condition 
such adverse conditions may continue or worsen in the future 
the company s primary funding needs are those required to finance its student loan portfolio and satisfy its cash requirements for new student loan originations and acquisitions 
in general  the amount  type  and cost of the company s funding  including securitizations and unsecured financing from the capital markets and borrowings from financial institutions  have a direct impact on the company s operating expenses and financial results and can limit the company s ability to grow its student loan assets 
the company relies upon secured financing vehicles as its most significant source of funding for student loans 
the company s primary secured financing vehicles are loan warehouse facilities and asset backed securitizations 
historically  the company funded new loan originations using loan warehouse facilities and asset backed securitizations 
student loan warehousing has historically allowed the company to buy and manage student loans prior to transferring them into more permanent financing arrangements 
in july  the company did not renew its liquidity provisions on its ffelp warehouse facility 
accordingly  the facility became a term facility and no new loan originations could be funded with this facility 
in august  the company began funding ffelp stafford and plus student loan originations for the academic year pursuant to the department s loan participation program as discussed below 
in august  the department implemented the purchase program and the participation program pursuant to the ecasla 
under the department s purchase program  the department will purchase loans at a price equal to the sum of i par value  ii accrued interest  iii the one percent origination fee paid to the department  and iv a fixed amount of per loan 
under the participation program  the department provides interim short term liquidity to ffelp lenders by purchasing participation interests in pools of ffelp loans 
ffelp lenders are charged a rate of commercial paper plus basis points on the principal amount of participation interests outstanding 
loans funded under the participation program for the academic year must be either refinanced by the lender or sold to the department pursuant to the purchase program prior to its expiration on september  to be eligible for purchase or participation under the department s programs  loans were originally limited to ffelp stafford or plus loans made for the academic year  first disbursed between may  and july   with eligible borrower benefits 
on october   legislation was enacted to extend the department s authority to address ffelp student loans made for the academic year and allowing for the extension of the participation program and purchase program from september  to september  the department indicated that loans for the academic year which are funded under the department s participation program will need to be refinanced or sold to the department prior to september  on november   the department announced the replication of the terms of the participation and purchase program  in accordance with the october th legislation  which will include ffelp student loans made for the academic year 
loans for the academic year will need to be refinanced or sold to the department prior to september  with respect to the origination of new ffelp student loans for the and academic years  the company currently expects to utilize the department s participation program 
the company has historically relied on asset backed securitizations as a significant source of funding for student loans on a long term basis 
the severe disruptions in the credit and financial markets have made asset backed securitization financing generally unavailable 
the company is currently unable to predict when market conditions will allow for future asset backed securitization financing 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents if the company is unable to obtain cost effective and stable funding alternatives  its funding capabilities and liquidity would be negatively impacted and its cost of funds could increase  adversely affecting the company s results of operations 
in addition  the company s ability to originate and acquire student loans would be limited or could be eliminated 
the company is exposed to mark to formula collateral support risk on its ffelp warehouse facility 
the company s warehouse facility for ffelp loans provides formula based advance rates based on current market conditions  which require equity support to be posted to the facility 
while the company does not believe that the loan valuation formula is reflective of the actual fair value of its loans  it is subject to compliance with these provisions of the warehouse facility agreement 
as of december   billion was outstanding under this facility 
under the current terms of the facility  the remaining student loan collateral will need to be refinanced or removed by may   the final maturity of the facility 
as of december   the company had million posted as equity funding support for the facility 
the company has utilized its million unsecured line of credit to fund equity advances on its warehouse facility 
as of december   the company had million outstanding under the line of credit and million available for future use 
the amount available under the line of credit is less than maximum capacity as a credit provider is no longer funding draw requests see below 
continued disruptions in the credit and financial markets may cause additional volatility in the loan valuation formula under the warehouse facility 
should a significant change in the valuation of loans result in additional required equity funding support for the warehouse facility greater than what the company can provide  the warehouse facility could be subject to an event of default resulting in a termination of the facility and an acceleration of the repayment provisions 
a default on the ffelp warehouse facility would result in an event of default on the company s unsecured line of credit that would result in the outstanding balance on the line of credit becoming immediately due and payable 
the company plans to remove and or refinance the remaining collateral in this facility by using the department s conduit program  using other financing arrangements  including secured transactions in the capital markets  using unrestricted operating cash  and or selling loans to third parties 
the company cannot predict if it will be successful at removing and or refinancing the remaining collateral in the ffelp warehouse facility and such terms may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company faces counterparty risk 
the company has exposure to the financial condition of its various lending  investment  and derivative counterparties 
if any of the company s counterparties is unable to perform its obligations  the company would  depending on the type of counterparty arrangement  experience a loss of liquidity or an economic loss 
related to derivative exposure  the company may not be able to cost effectively replace the derivative position depending on the type of derivative and the current economic environment 
if the company was not able to replace the derivative position  the company would be exposed to a greater level of interest rate and or foreign currency exchange rate risk which could lead to additional losses 
the lending commitment under the company s million unsecured line of credit is provided by a total of thirteen banks  with no individual bank representing more than of the total lending commitment 
the bank lending group includes lehman brothers bank lehman  a subsidiary of lehman brothers holdings inc  which represents approximately of the lending commitment under the line of credit 
on september   lehman brothers holdings inc filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
since the bankruptcy filing  the company has experienced funding delays from lehman for its portion of the lending commitment and does not expect lehman to fund future borrowing requests 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
as a source of liquidity for funding new ffelp student loan originations  the company maintains a participation agreement with the related party union bank and trust company union bank  as trustee for various grantor trusts  under which union bank has agreed to purchase from the company participation interests in student loans 
the company currently can participate loans to union bank to the extent of availability under the grantor trusts  up to million 
in the event that union bank experiences adverse changes to its financial condition  such participation agreement liquidity may not be available to the company in the future 
as of december   the company had a total of million invested in guaranteed investment contracts gics 
approximately million of these gics are with foreign banks  which receive support from regional or national governments 
the remaining million of these gics are with a total of three banks  all of which are currently at least a rated  and with one such bank representing of this amount 
these agreements may be terminated by the company if the gic providers unsecured credit rating falls below a certain threshold 
a default by the counterparties under the gics could lead to a loss of the company s investment and have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents when the mark to market value of a derivative instrument is negative  the company owes the counterparty and  therefore  has no immediate counterparty risk 
additionally  if the negative mark to market value of derivatives with a counterparty exceeds a specified threshold  the company may have to make a collateral deposit with the counterparty 
the threshold at which the company posts collateral may depend on the company s unsecured credit rating 
if interest and foreign currency exchange rates move materially  the company could be required to deposit a significant amount of collateral with its derivative instrument counterparties 
the collateral deposits  if significant  could negatively impact the company s capital resources 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  this generally indicates that the counterparty owes the company 
if the counterparty fails to perform  credit risk with such counterparty is equal to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative less any collateral held by the company 
the company attempts to manage market and credit risks associated with interest and foreign currency exchange rates by establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken  and by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties that are reviewed periodically by the company s risk committee 
the company also has a policy of requiring that all derivative contracts be governed by an international swaps and derivatives association  inc master agreement 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk because the interest rate characteristics of the company s assets do not match the interest rate characteristics of the funding for the assets 
the company issues asset backed securities  the vast majority being variable rate  to fund its student loan assets 
the variable rate debt is generally indexed to month libor  set by auction  or through a remarketing process 
the income generated by the company s student loan assets is generally driven by short term indices treasury bills and commercial paper that are different from those which affect the company s liabilities generally libor  which creates basis risk 
moreover  the company also faces repricing risk due to the timing of the interest rate resets on its liabilities  which may occur as infrequently as every quarter  and the timing of the interest rate resets on its assets  which generally occurs daily 
in a declining interest rate environment  this may cause the company s student loan spread to compress  while in a rising rate environment  it may cause the spread to increase 
in using different index types and different index reset frequencies to fund assets  the company is exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk  which  as noted above  is the risk that the different indices may reset at different frequencies  or will not move in the same direction or with the same magnitude 
while these indices are short term with rate movements that are highly correlated over a longer period of time  they have recently become less correlated 
there can be no assurance the indices will regain their high level of correlation in the future due to capital market dislocations or other factors not within the company s control 
in such circumstances  the company s earnings could be adversely affected  possibly to a material extent 
the company has used derivative instruments to hedge the repricing risk due to the timing of the interest rate resets on its assets and liabilities 
however  the company does not generally hedge the basis risk due to the different interest rate indices associated with its assets and liabilities since the derivatives needed to hedge this risk are generally illiquid or non existent and the relationship between the indices for most of the company s assets and liabilities has been highly correlated over a long period of time 
recently  the spread has widened and may widen further  which has and may continue to have a significant impact on the net spread of the company s student loan portfolio 
as of december   the company had approximately billion of ffelp loans indexed to three month financial commercial paper rate and billion of debt indexed to libor 
due to the unintended consequences of government intervention in the commercial paper markets and limited issuances of qualifying financial commercial paper  the relationship between the three month financial cp and libor rates has been distorted and volatile 
to address this issue  the department announced that for purposes of calculating the ffelp loan index from october  to december   the federal reserve s commercial paper funding facility rate was used for those days in which no three month financial commercial paper rate was available 
this action partially mitigated the recent volatility between cp and libor  however  there are no assurances that the department will utilize a similar methodology for the first quarter of or in the future 
characteristics unique to asset backed securitizations may negatively affect the company s continued liquidity 
the interest rates on certain of the company s asset backed securities are set and periodically reset via a dutch auction auction rate securities or through a remarketing utilizing remarketing agents variable rate demand notes 
for auction rate securities  investors and potential investors submit orders through a broker dealer as to the principal amount of notes they wish to buy  hold  or sell at various interest rates 
the broker dealers submit their clients orders to the auction agent  who then determines the clearing interest rate for the upcoming period 
interest rates on these auction rate securities are reset periodically  generally every to days  by the auction agent or agents 
beginning in the first quarter of  as part of the ongoing credit market crisis  auction rate securities from various issuers have failed to receive sufficient order interest from potential investors to clear successfully  resulting in failed auction status 
since february  the company s auction rate securities have failed in this manner 
under historical conditions  the broker dealers would purchase these securities if investor demand is weak 
however  since february  the broker dealers have been allowing auctions to fail 
currently  all of the company s auction rate securities are in a failed auction status and the company believes they will remain in a failed auction status for an extended period of time and possibly permanently 

table of contents as a result of a failed auction  the auction rate securities will generally pay interest to the holder at a maximum rate as defined by the indenture 
while these rates will vary by class of security  they will generally be based on a spread to libor or treasury securities 
these maximum rates are subject to increase if the credit ratings on the bonds are downgraded 
the company cannot predict whether future auctions related to its auction rate securities will be successful 
the company is currently seeking alternatives for reducing its exposure to the auction rate market  but may not be able to achieve alternate financing for some or all of its auction rate securities 
if there is no demand for the company s auction rate securities  the company could be subject to interest costs substantially above the anticipated and historical rates paid on these types of securities 
for variable rate demand notes  the remarketing agents set the price  which is then offered to investors 
if there are insufficient potential bid orders to purchase all of the notes offered for sale  the company could be subject to interest costs substantially above the anticipated and historical rates paid on these types of securities 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk because of the interest rate characteristics of certain of its assets and the interest rate characteristics of the related funding of such assets 
loans originated prior to april  generally earn interest at the higher of a floating rate based on the special allowance payment or sap formula set by the department and the borrower rate  which is fixed over a period of time 
the company generally finances its student loan portfolio with variable rate debt 
in low and or declining interest rate environments  when the fixed borrower rate is higher than the rate produced by the sap formula  the company s student loans earn at a fixed rate while the interest on the variable rate debt typically continues to decline 
in these interest rate environments  the company may earn additional spread income that it refers to as floor income 
depending on the type of loan and when it was originated  the borrower rate is either fixed to term or is reset to an annual rate each july as a result  for loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term  the company may earn floor income for an extended period of time  which the company refers to as fixed rate floor income  and for those loans where the borrower rate is reset annually on july  the company may earn floor income to the next reset date  which the company refers to as variable rate floor income 
in accordance with new legislation enacted in  lenders are required to rebate fixed rate floor income and variable rate floor income to the department for all new ffelp loans first originated on or after april  absent the use of derivative instruments  a rise in interest rates may reduce the amount of floor income received and this may have an impact on earnings due to interest margin compression caused by increasing financing costs  until such time as the federally insured loans earn interest at a variable rate in accordance with their special allowance payment formulas 
in higher interest rate environments  where the interest rate rises above the borrower rate and fixed rate loans effectively convert to variable rate loans  the impact of the rate fluctuations is reduced 
the company is subject to foreign currency exchange risk and such risk could lead to increased costs 
as a result of the company s offerings in euro denominated notes  the company is exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro  and libor and euribor 
the principal and accrued interest on these notes is re measured at each reporting period and recorded on the company s balance sheet in us dollars based on the foreign currency exchange rate on that date 
when foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro change significantly  earnings may fluctuate significantly 
the company entered into cross currency interest rate swaps that hedge these risks but  as discussed below  such swaps may not always be effective 
the company s derivative instruments may not be successful in managing interest and foreign currency exchange rate risks  which may negatively impact the company s operations 
when the company utilizes derivative instruments  it utilizes them to manage interest and foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity 
the company s derivative instruments are intended as economic hedges but do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 consequently  the change in fair value  called the mark to market  of these derivative instruments is included in the company s operating results 
changes or shifts in the forward yield curve and foreign currency exchange rates can and have significantly impacted the valuation of the company s derivatives 
accordingly  changes or shifts in the forward yield curve and foreign currency exchange rates will impact the financial position  results of operations  and cash flows of the company 
further  the company may incur costs or be subject to bid ask spreads if the company terminates a derivative instrument 
the derivative instruments used by the company are typically in the form of interest rate swaps  basis swaps  and cross currency interest rate swaps 

table of contents developing an effective strategy for dealing with movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates is complex  and no strategy can completely insulate the company from risks associated with such fluctuations 
although the company believes its derivative instruments are highly effective  because many of its derivatives are not balance guaranteed to a particular pool of student loans  the company is subject to prepayment risk that could result in the company being under or over hedged  which could result in material losses to the company 
in addition  the company s interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk management activities could expose the company to substantial mark to market losses if interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates move materially differently from the environment when the derivatives were entered into 
as a result  the company cannot offer any assurance that its economic hedging activities will effectively manage its interest and foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity  or have the desired beneficial impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
the ratings of the company or of any securities issued by the company may change  which may increase the company s costs of capital and may reduce the liquidity of the company s securities 
ratings are based primarily on the creditworthiness of the company  the underlying assets of asset backed securitizations  the amount of credit enhancement in any given transaction  and the legal structure of any given transaction 
ratings are not a recommendation to purchase  hold  or sell any of the company s securities inasmuch as the ratings do not address the market price or suitability for investors 
there is no assurance that ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that current ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn by any rating agency 
ratings for the company or any of its securities may be increased  lowered  or withdrawn by any rating agency if  in the rating agency s judgment  circumstances so warrant 
if the company s credit ratings are lowered or withdrawn  the company may experience an increase in the interest rate paid on the company s unsecured line of credit or the interest rates or other costs associated with other capital raising activities by the company  which may negatively affect the company s operations 
moreover  if the unsecured ratings of the company are lowered or withdrawn  it may affect the terms of the company s outstanding derivative contracts and could result in requirements for the company to post additional collateral under those contracts 
additionally  a lowered or withdrawn credit rating may negatively affect the liquidity of the company s securities 
general risk factors a continued economic recession could reduce demand for company products and services and lead to lower revenue and lower earnings 
the company earns revenue from the interest and fees charged on the loans and other products and services it sells 
when the economy slows  the demand for those products and services can fall  reducing interest and fee revenue and earnings 
an economic downturn can also hurt the ability of borrowers to repay their loans  causing higher loan losses 
several factors could cause the economy to slow down or even recede  including higher energy costs  higher interest rates  reduced consumer or corporate spending  declining home values  natural disasters  terrorist activities  military conflicts  and the normal cyclical nature of the economy 
changes in accounting policies or accounting standards  changes in how accounting standards are interpreted or applied  and incorrect estimates and assumptions by management in connection with the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements could materially affect the reported amounts of asset and liabilities  the reported amounts of income and expenses  and related disclosures 
the company s accounting policies are fundamental to determining and understanding financial condition and results of operations 
some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
several of the company s accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult  subjective  and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies 
from time to time the financial accounting standards board fasb and the sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of external financial statements 
in addition  accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards such as the fasb and or the sec may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied 
changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond the company s control  can be hard to predict  and could materially impact how the company reports its financial condition and results of operations 
the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively or apply an existing standard differently  also retroactively  in each case resulting in the company potentially restating prior period financial statements that could potentially be material 

table of contents the company s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 
the outcome of legal proceedings may differ from the company s expectations because the outcomes of litigation  including regulatory matters  are often difficult to reliably predict 
various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable  or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates  such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment  a significant settlement  significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law 
a future adverse ruling  settlement  or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period 
the market price of the company s class a common stock may fluctuate significantly  which may result in losses for investors 
from january  to february   the closing daily sales price of the company s class a common stock as reported by the new york stock exchange ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
the company expects the class a common stock to continue to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors  including factors beyond the company s control 
these factors include changes in interest rates and credit market conditions affecting the cost and availability of financing for the company s student loan assets changes in the education financing regulatory framework changes in demand for education financing or other products and services that the company offers variations in the company s quarterly operating results changes in financial estimates by securities analysts changes in market valuations of comparable companies future sales of the company s class a common stock in addition  in may the company announced that it was temporarily suspending its quarterly dividend payments of per share on its class a and class b common stock 
the company will continue to evaluate its dividend policy  but the payment of future dividends remains in the discretion of the company s board of directors and will continue to depend on the company s earnings  capital requirements  financial condition  and other factors 
in addition  the payment of dividends is subject to the terms of certain other outstanding securities issued by the company 
the company does not currently anticipate resuming the payment of dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future 
the company may not meet the expectations of shareholders and or of securities analysts at some time in the future  and the market price of the company s class a common stock could decline as a result 
negative publicity that may be associated with the student lending industry  including negative publicity about the company  may harm the company s reputation and adversely affect operating results 
during and  the student lending industry was the subject of various investigations and reports 
the publicity associated with these investigations and reports may have a negative impact on the company s reputation 
to the extent that potential or existing customers decide not to utilize the company s products or services as a result of such publicity  the company s operating results may be adversely affected 
if management does not effectively execute the company s restructuring objectives to reduce infrastructure costs and reposition the company in the education market place  it could adversely affect the company s customers  operations  revenue  and ability to compete 
as the result of ffel program regulation changes  financial market disruption  and an ongoing economic recession  the company has implemented restructuring objectives to reduce infrastructure costs and reposition itself in the education market place 
beginning in the third quarter of and continuing into  the company has executed initiatives that created efficiencies within its asset generation business and decreased operating expenses through a reduction in workforce  realignment of operating facilities  and restructuring of operating systems and system support 
if management is unable to successfully implement the company s reorganization objectives or if these objectives do not have the desired effects or result in the projected efficiencies  the company may incur additional or unexpected expenses  reputation damage  or loss of customers which would adversely affect the company s operations and revenues 

table of contents failures in the company s information technology system could materially disrupt its business 
the company s servicing and operating processes are highly dependent upon its information technology system infrastructure  and the company faces the risk of business disruption if failures in its information systems occur  which could have a material impact upon its business and operations 
the company depends heavily on its own computer based data processing systems in servicing both its own student loans and those of third party servicing customers and providing tuition payment and campus commerce transactions and lead generation products and services 
the company regularly backs up its data and maintains detailed disaster recovery plans 
a major physical disaster or other calamity that causes significant damage to information systems could adversely affect the company s business 
additionally  loss of information systems for a sustained period of time could have a negative impact on the company s performance and ultimately on cash flow in the event the company were unable to process transactions and or provide services to customers 
a compromise of customer data could negatively impact the company s business 
the company  on its own behalf and on behalf of other entities  stores a significant amount of personal data about the customers to whom the company provides services 
if access to customer data were compromised through breach of its systems  fraud  or otherwise  the company could suffer reputation damage  loss of customers  and unexpected financial costs 
exposure related to certain tax issues could decrease the company s net income 
a corporation is considered to be a personal holding company under the us internal revenue code of  as amended the code  if at least of its adjusted ordinary gross income is personal holding company income generally  passive income and at any time during the last half of the taxable year more than half  by value  of its stock is owned by five or fewer individuals  as determined under attribution rules of the code 
if both of these tests are met  a personal holding company is subject to an additional tax on its undistributed personal holding company income  currently at a rate 
five or fewer individuals hold more than half the value of the company s stock 
in june  the company submitted a request for a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service seeking a determination that its federally guaranteed student loans qualify as assets of a lending or finance business  as defined in the code 
such a determination would have assured the company that holding such loans does not make it a personal holding company 
based on its historical practice of not issuing private letter rulings concerning matters that it considers to be primarily factual  however  the internal revenue service has indicated that it will not issue the requested ruling  taking no position on the merits of the legal issue 
so long as more than half of the company s value continues to be held by five or fewer individuals  if it were to be determined that some portion of its federally guaranteed student loans does not qualify as assets of a lending or finance business  as defined in the code  the company could become subject to personal holding company tax on its undistributed personal holding company income 
the company continues to believe that neither nelnet  inc nor any of its subsidiaries is a personal holding company 
however  even if nelnet  inc or one of its subsidiaries was determined to be a personal holding company  the company believes that by utilizing intercompany distributions  it could eliminate or substantially eliminate its exposure to personal holding company taxes  although it cannot assure that this will be the case 
the company is subject to federal and state income tax laws and regulations 
income tax regulations are often complex and require interpretation 
changes in income tax regulations could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
if states enact legislation  alter apportionment methodologies  or aggressively apply the income tax nexus standards  the company may become subject to additional state taxes 
the applicability and taxation on the earnings from intangible personal property has been the subject of state audits and litigation with state taxing authorities and tax policy debates by various state legislatures 
as the us congress and us supreme court have not provided clear guidance in this regard  conflicting state laws and court decisions create tremendous uncertainty and expense for taxpayers conducting interstate commerce 
from time to time  the company engages in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty 
examples of such transactions include asset and business acquisitions and dispositions  financing transactions  apportionment  nexus standards  and income recognition 
significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions 
the company prepares and files tax returns based on the interpretation of tax laws and regulations 
in the normal course of business  the company s tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities

overview the company is an education planning and financing company focused on providing quality products and services to students  families  and schools nationwide 
the company is a vertically integrated organization that offers a broad range of products and services to its customers throughout the education life cycle 
built through a focus on long term organic growth and further enhanced by strategic acquisitions  the company earns its revenues from fee based revenues related to its diversified education finance and service operations and from net interest income on its portfolio of student loans 
the following provides certain events and operating activities that have impacted the financial condition and operating results of the company 
these items include reduced exposure to liquidity risk on the company s ffelp warehouse facility continued diversification of revenue through fee based businesses continued decreases in operating expenses reduction in liquidity risk exposure ffelp warehouse facility the company s multi year committed financing facility for ffelp loans has historically allowed the company to buy and manage the majority of its student loans prior to transferring them into more permanent financing arrangements 
the terms and conditions of this facility provides for formula based advance rates based on current market conditions  which require equity support to be posted to the facility 
in order to reduce exposure related to these equity support provisions  the company reduced the amount of loans included in the facility in by i completing asset backed securities transactions of billion which were issued at rates higher than those historically achieved by the company  and ii selling billion par value in student loan assets resulting in the recognition of a loss of million 
in addition  the company incurred expenses of million in from fees paid related to liquidity contingency planning 
as of december   the outstanding balance under this facility was billion 
the company plans to remove and or refinance the remaining collateral in this facility by using the department s conduit program as discussed below  using other financing arrangements  using unrestricted operating cash  and or selling loans to third parties 
revenue diversification in recent years  the company has expanded products and services generated from businesses that are not dependent upon government programs reducing legislative and political risk 
this revenue is primarily generated from products and services offered in the company s tuition payment processing and campus commerce and enrollment services operating segments 
the only product and service offering in these segments that was affected by student loan legislative developments is list marketing services 
the table below includes the company s revenue from fee based businesses and shows the revenue earned by the company s operating segments that are less dependent upon government programs  excluding list marketing services 
year ended december  change change tuition payment processing and campus commerce enrollment services content management and lead generation total revenue from fee based businesses less dependent upon government programs enrollment services list marketing services student loan and guaranty servicing software and technical services total revenue from fee based businesses 
table of contents operating expenses as a result of the restructuring plans implemented in september and january  as well as the company s continued focus on capitalizing on the operating leverage of the company s business structure and strategies  operating expenses decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period a year ago 
excluding restructuring expense  impairment expense  and liquidity contingency planning fees  operating expenses decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in results of operations the company s operating results are primarily driven by the performance of its existing portfolio  the cost necessary to generate new assets  the revenues generated by its fee based businesses  and the cost to provide those services 
the performance of the company s portfolio is driven by net interest income and losses related to credit quality of the assets along with the cost to administer and service the assets and related debt 
net interest income the company generates a significant portion of its earnings from the spread  referred to as its student loan spread  between the yield the company receives on its student loan portfolio and the cost of funding these loans 
this spread income is reported on the company s consolidated statements of income as net interest income 
the amortization of loan premiums  including capitalized costs of origination  the per year consolidation loan rebate fee paid to the department  and yield adjustments from borrower benefit programs  are netted against loan interest income on the company s statements of income 
the amortization of debt issuance costs is included in interest expense on the company s statements of income 
the company s portfolio of ffelp loans originated prior to april  earns interest at the higher of a variable rate based on the special allowance payment sap formula set by the department and the borrower rate 
the sap formula is based on an applicable index plus a fixed spread that is dependent upon when the loan was originated  the loan s repayment status  and funding sources for the loan 
as a result of one of the provisions of the higher education reconciliation act of hera  the company s portfolio of ffelp loans originated on or after april  earns interest at a variable rate based on the sap formula 
for the portfolio of loans originated on or after april   when the borrower rate exceeds the variable rate based on the sap formula  the company must return the excess to the department 
on september   the president signed into law the college cost reduction act 
this legislation has and will continue to have a significant impact on the company s net interest income and should be considered when reviewing the company s results of operations 
among other things  this legislation reduced special allowance payments to for profit lenders and not for profit lenders by percentage points and percentage points  respectively  for both stafford and consolidation loans disbursed on or after october  reduced special allowance payments to for profit lenders and not for profit lenders by percentage points and percentage points  respectively  for plus loans disbursed on or after october  increased origination fees paid by lenders on all ffelp loan types  from percent to percent  for all loans first disbursed on or after october  eliminated all provisions relating to exceptional performer status  and the monetary benefit associated with it  effective october  reduces default insurance to percent of the unpaid principal of such loans  for loans first disbursed on or after october  the impact of this legislation has reduced the annual yield on ffelp loans originated after october  the company believes it can mitigate some of the reduction in annual yield by creating efficiencies and lowering costs  modifying borrower benefits  and reducing loan acquisition costs 
because the company generates a significant portion of its earnings from its student loan spread  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s balance sheet is very important to its operations 
the current and future interest rate environment can and will affect the company s interest earnings  net interest income  and net income 
the effects of changing interest rate environments are further outlined in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 

table of contents investment interest income  which is a component of net interest income  includes income from unrestricted interest earning deposits and funds in the company s special purpose entities which are utilized for its asset backed securitizations 
net interest income also includes interest expense on unsecured debt offerings 
the proceeds from these unsecured debt offerings were and have been used by the company to fund general business operations  certain asset and business acquisitions  and the repurchase of stock under the company s stock repurchase plan 
provision for loan losses management estimates and establishes an allowance for loan losses through a provision charged to expense 
losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collectability of the loan principal is unlikely 
recovery of amounts previously charged off is credited to the allowance for loan losses 
management maintains the allowance for federally insured and non federally insured loans at a level believed to be adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
the company analyzes the allowance separately for its federally insured loans and its non federally insured loans 
management bases the allowance for the federally insured loan portfolio on periodic evaluations of the company s loan portfolios  considering past experience  trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors  changes to federal student loan programs  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
one of the changes to the higher education act as a result of hera s enactment in february  was to lower the guaranty rates on ffelp loans  including a decrease in insurance and reinsurance on portfolios receiving the benefit of the exceptional performance designation by  from to of principal and accrued interest effective july   and a decrease in insurance and reinsurance on portfolios not subject to the exceptional performance designation by  from to of principal and accrued interest effective for all loans first disbursed on and after july  
in september  the company was re designated as an exceptional performer by the department in recognition of its exceptional level of performance in servicing ffelp loans 
as a result of this designation  the company received reimbursement reimbursement prior to july  on all eligible ffelp default claims submitted for reimbursement during the applicable period 
only ffelp loans that were serviced by the company  as well as loans owned by the company and serviced by other service providers designated as exceptional performers by the department  were eligible for the reimbursement 
on september   the president signed into law the college cost reduction act 
among other things  this legislation eliminated all provisions relating to exceptional performer status  and the monetary benefit associated with it  effective october  accordingly  the majority of claims submitted on or after october  are subject to reimbursement at or of principal and accrued interest depending on the disbursement date of the loan 
during  the company recorded an expense of million to increase the company s allowance for loan losses related to the increase in risk share as a result of the elimination of the exceptional performer program 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on the non federally insured loans  the company considers several factors including loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status  months in repayment  delinquency status  type of program  and trends in defaults in the portfolio based on company and industry data 
the company places a non federally insured loan on nonaccrual status and charges off the loan when the collection of principal and interest is days past due 
other income the company also earns fees and generates income from other sources  including principally loan and guaranty servicing income  fee based income on borrower late fees  payment management activities  and certain marketing and enrollment services  and fees from providing software services

the company s operating segments are defined by the products and services they offer or the types of customers they serve  and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management 
the accounting policies of the company s operating segments are the same as those described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
intersegment revenues are charged by a segment to another segment that provides the product or service 
intersegment revenues and expenses are included within each segment consistent with the income statement presentation provided to management 
changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial information

management  including the company s chief operating decision maker  evaluates the performance of the company s operating segments based on their profitability 
as discussed further below  management measures the profitability of the company s operating segments on the basis of base net income 
accordingly  information regarding the company s operating segments is provided based on base net income

table of contents historically  the company generated the majority of its revenue from net interest income earned in its asset generation and management operating segment 
in recent years  the company has made several acquisitions that have expanded the company s products and services and has diversified its revenue primarily from fee based businesses 
the company currently offers a broad range of pre college  in college  and post college products and services to students  families  schools  and financial institutions 
these products and services help students and families plan and pay for their education and students plan their careers 
the company s products and services are designed to simplify the education planning and financing process and are focused on providing value to students  families  and schools throughout the education life cycle 
the company continues to look for ways to diversify its sources of revenue  including those generated from businesses that are not dependent upon government programs  reducing legislative and political risk 
base net income is the primary financial performance measure used by management to develop the company s financial plans  track results  and establish corporate performance targets and incentive compensation 
while base net income is not a substitute for reported results under gaap  the company relies on base net income in operating its business because base net income permits management to make meaningful period to period comparisons of the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management 
management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the core business activities of the company s operating segments 
accordingly  the tables presented below reflect base net income which is reviewed and utilized by management to manage the business for each of the company s operating segments 
reconciliation of the segment totals to the company s consolidated operating results in accordance with gaap are also included in the tables below 
included below under non gaap performance measures is further discussion regarding base net income and its limitations  including a table that details the differences between base net income and gaap net income by operating segment

non gaap performance measures in accordance with the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission  the company prepares financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in addition to evaluating the company s gaap based financial information  management also evaluates the company s operating segments on a non gaap performance measure referred to as base net income for each operating segment 
while base net income is not a substitute for reported results under gaap  the company relies on base net income to manage each operating segment because management believes these measures provide additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management 
base net income is the primary financial performance measure used by management to develop financial plans  allocate resources  track results  evaluate performance  establish corporate performance targets  and determine incentive compensation 
accordingly  financial information is reported to management on a base net income basis by operating segment  as these are the measures used regularly by the company s chief operating decision maker 
the company s board of directors utilizes base net income to set performance targets and evaluate management s performance 
the company also believes analysts  rating agencies  and creditors use base net income in their evaluation of the company s results of operations 
while base net income is not a substitute for reported results under gaap  the company utilizes base net income in operating its business because base net income permits management to make meaningful period to period comparisons by eliminating the temporary volatility in the company s performance that arises from certain items that are primarily affected by factors beyond the control of management 
management believes base net income provides additional insight into the financial performance of the core business activities of the company s operations 

table of contents limitations of base net income while gaap provides a uniform  comprehensive basis of accounting  for the reasons discussed above  management believes that base net income is an important additional tool for providing a more complete understanding of the company s results of operations 
nevertheless  base net income is subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider 
for example  as stated above  unlike financial accounting  there is no comprehensive  authoritative guidance for management reporting 
the company s base net income is not a defined term within gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
investors  therefore  may not be able to compare the company s performance with that of other companies based upon base net income 
base net income results are only meant to supplement gaap results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely monitored and used by the company s management and board of directors to assess performance and information which the company believes is important to analysts  rating agencies  and creditors 
other limitations of base net income arise from the specific adjustments that management makes to gaap results to derive base net income results 
these differences are described below 
the adjustments required to reconcile from the company s base net income measure to its gaap results of operations relate to differing treatments for derivatives  foreign currency transaction adjustments  discontinued operations  and certain other items that management does not consider in evaluating the company s operating results 
the following table reflects adjustments associated with these areas by operating segment and corporate activity and overhead student tuition loan payment software asset corporate and processing and generation activity guaranty and campus enrollment technical and and servicing commerce services services management overhead total year ended december  derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments amortization of intangible assets compensation related to business combinations variable rate floor income  net of settlements on derivatives income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net tax effect a total adjustments to gaap year ended december  derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments amortization of intangible assets compensation related to business combinations variable rate floor income  net of settlements on derivatives income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net tax effect a total adjustments to gaap year ended december  derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments amortization of intangible assets compensation related to business combinations variable rate floor income  net of settlements on derivatives income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net tax effect a total adjustments to gaap a beginning in  tax effect is computed using the company s consolidated effective tax rate for each applicable quarterly period 
in prior periods  tax effect was computed at and the change in the value of the put options for prior periods included in corporate activity and overhead was not tax effected as this is not deductible for income tax purposes 

table of contents differences between gaap and base net income management s financial planning and evaluation of operating results does not take into account the following items because their volatility and or inherent uncertainty affect the period to period comparability of the company s results of operations 
a more detailed discussion of the differences between gaap and base net income follows 
derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments base net income excludes the periodic unrealized gains and losses that are caused by the change in fair value on derivatives used in the company s risk management strategy in which the company does not qualify for hedge treatment under gaap 
sfas no 
requires that changes in fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria  as specified by sfas no 
 are met 
the company maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce the economic effect of interest rate volatility 
derivative instruments primarily used by the company include interest rate swaps  basis swaps  and cross currency interest rate swaps 
management has structured all of the company s derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective 
however  the company does not qualify its derivatives for hedge treatment as defined by sfas no 
 and the stand alone derivative must be marked to market in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item 
the company believes these point in time estimates of asset and liability values that are subject to interest rate fluctuations make it difficult to evaluate the ongoing results of operations against its business plan and affect the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
included in base net income are the economic effects of the company s derivative instruments  which includes any cash paid or received being recognized as an expense or revenue upon actual derivative settlements 
these settlements are included in derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the company s consolidated statements of income 
base net income excludes the foreign currency transaction gains or losses caused by the re measurement of the company s euro denominated bonds to us dollars 
in connection with the issuance of the euro denominated bonds  the company has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps 
under the terms of these agreements  the principal payments on the euro denominated notes will effectively be paid at the exchange rate in effect at the issuance date of the bonds 
the cross currency interest rate swaps also convert the floating rate paid on the euro denominated bonds euribor index to an index based on libor 
included in base net income are the economic effects of any cash paid or received being recognized as an expense or revenue upon actual settlements of the cross currency interest rate swaps 
these settlements are included in derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the company s consolidated statements of income 
however  the gains or losses caused by the re measurement of the euro denominated bonds to us dollars and the change in market value of the cross currency interest rate swaps are excluded from base net income as the company believes the point in time estimates of value that are subject to currency rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments make it difficult to evaluate the ongoing results of operations against the company s business plan and affect the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
the re measurement of the euro denominated bonds correlates with the change in fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps 
however  the company will experience unrealized gains or losses related to the cross currency interest rate swaps if the two underlying indices and related forward curve do not move in parallel 
base net income also excludes the change in fair value of put options issued by the company for certain business acquisitions 
the put options are valued by the company each reporting period using a black scholes pricing model 
therefore  the fair value of these options is primarily affected by the strike price and term of the underlying option  the company s current stock price  and the dividend yield and volatility of the company s stock 
the company believes these point in time estimates of value that are subject to fluctuations make it difficult to evaluate the ongoing results of operations against the company s business plans and affects the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
the gains and or losses included in derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the company s consolidated statements of income are primarily caused by interest rate and currency volatility  changes in the value of put options based on the inputs used in the black scholes pricing model  as well as the volume and terms of put options and of derivatives not receiving hedge treatment 
base net income excludes these unrealized gains and losses and isolates the effect of interest rate  currency  and put option volatility on the fair value of such instruments during the period 
under gaap  the effects of these factors on the fair value of the put options and the derivative instruments but not the underlying hedged item tend to show more volatility in the short term 
amortization of intangible assets base net income excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles  which arises primarily from the acquisition of definite life intangible assets in connection with the company s acquisitions  since the company feels that such charges do not drive the company s operating performance on a long term basis and can affect the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
compensation related to business combinations the company has structured certain business combinations in which the consideration paid has been dependent on the sellers continued employment with the company 
as such  the value of the consideration paid is recognized as compensation expense by the company over the term of the applicable employment agreement 
base net income excludes this expense because the company believes such charges do not drive its operating performance on a long term basis and can affect the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
if the company did not enter into the employment agreements in connection with the acquisition  the amount paid to these former shareholders of the acquired entity would have been recorded by the company as additional consideration of the acquired entity  thus  not having an effect on the company s results of operations 

table of contents variable rate floor income  net of settlements on derivatives loans that reset annually on july can generate excess spread income compared with the rate based on the special allowance payment formula in declining interest rate environments 
the company refers to this additional income as variable rate floor income 
the company excludes variable rate floor income  net of settlements paid on derivatives used to hedge student loan assets earning variable rate floor income  from its base net income since the timing and amount of variable rate floor income if any is uncertain  it has been eliminated by legislation for all loans originated on and after april   and it is in excess of expected spreads 
in addition  because variable rate floor income is subject to the underlying rate for the subject loans being reset annually on july  it is a factor beyond the company s control which can affect the period to period comparability of results of operations 
variable rate floor income was calculated by the company on a statutory maximum basis 
however  as a result of the disruption in the capital markets beginning in august  the full benefit of variable rate floor income calculated on a statutory maximum basis has not been realized by the company due to the widening of the spread between short term interest rate indices and the company s actual cost of funds 
as a result of the ongoing volatility of interest rates  effective october   the company changed its calculation of variable rate floor income to better reflect the economic benefit received by the company related to this income taking into consideration the volatility of certain rate indices which offset the value received 
for the year ended december   the economic benefit received by the company related to variable rate floor income was million 
there was no economic benefit received by the company related to variable rate floor income for the three months ended december  variable rate floor income calculated on a statutory maximum basis for the three months and year ended december  was million and million  respectively 
beginning october   the economic benefit used by the company has been used to determine core student loan spread and base net income 
discontinued operations in may  the company sold edulinx 
as a result of this transaction  the results of operations for edulinx are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the company presents base net income excluding discontinued operations since the operations and cash flows of edulinx have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the company

the company will originate or acquire loans through its campus based channel either directly under one of its brand names or through other originating lenders 
in addition to its brands  the company acquires student loans from lenders to whom the company provides marketing and or origination services established through various contracts 
branding partners are lenders for which the company acts as a marketing agent in specified geographic areas 
a forward flow lender is one for whom the company provides origination services but provides no marketing services or whom simply agrees to sell loans to the company under forward sale commitments

since august  the capital markets have experienced unprecedented disruptions  which have had an adverse impact on the company s earnings and financial condition 
since the company could not determine nor control the length of time or extent to which the capital markets would remain disrupted  it reduced its direct and indirect costs related to its asset generation activities and was more selective in pursuing origination activity in the direct to consumer channel 
accordingly  beginning in january  the company suspended consolidation and private student loan originations and exercised contractual rights to discontinue  suspend  or defer the acquisition of student loans in connection with substantially all of its branding and forward flow relationships 
prior to and in conjunction with exercising this right  during the first quarter of  the company accelerated the purchase of loans from certain branding partner and forward flow lenders of approximately million 
during july  the company purchased approximately million of student loans from certain branding partner and forward flow lenders of which such purchases were previously deferred 
these loans were financed in the company s ffelp warehouse facility prior to the term out of this agreement 
historically  the company funded new loan originations using loan warehouse facilities and asset backed securitizations 
student loan warehousing has historically allowed the company to buy and manage student loans prior to transferring them into more permanent financing arrangements 
in july  the company did not renew its liquidity provisions on its ffelp warehouse facility 
accordingly  the facility became a term facility and no new loan originations could be funded with this facility 
in august  the company began funding ffelp stafford and plus student loan originations for the academic year pursuant to the department s loan participation program as discussed below 
in august  the department implemented the loan purchase commitment program and the loan participation program pursuant to the ecasla 
under the department s purchase program  the department will purchase loans at a price equal to the sum of i par value  ii accrued interest  iii the one percent origination fee paid to the department  and iv a fixed amount of per loan 
under the participation program  the department provides interim short term liquidity to ffelp lenders by purchasing participation interests in pools of ffelp loans 
ffelp lenders are charged a rate of commercial paper plus basis points on the principal amount of participation interests outstanding 
loans funded under the participation program must be either refinanced by the lender or sold to the department pursuant to the purchase program prior to its expiration on september  to be eligible for purchase or participation under the department s programs  loans were originally limited to ffelp stafford or plus loans made for the academic year  first disbursed between may  and july   with eligible borrower benefits 
on october   legislation was enacted to extend the department s authority to address ffelp student loans made for the academic year and allowing for the extension of the participation program and purchase program from september  to september  the department indicated that loans for the academic year which are funded under the department s participation program will need to be refinanced or sold to the department prior to september  on november   the department announced the replication of the terms of the participation and purchase program  in accordance with the october th legislation  which will include ffelp student loans made for the academic year 

table of contents the company plans to continue to use the participation program to fund loans originated for the and academic years 
these programs are allowing the company to continue originating new federal student loans to all students regardless of the school they attend

the special allowance yield adjustment includes net settlements on derivative instruments that were used to hedge this loan portfolio earning the excess yield 
on january   the company entered into a settlement agreement with the department to resolve the audit by the oig of the company s portfolio of student loans receiving special allowance payments 
under the terms of the agreement  all special allowance payments were eliminated for periods on and after july  the company had been deferring recognition of special allowance payments related to those loans subject to the oig audit effective july  pending satisfactory resolution of this issue 

table of contents as noted in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  the company has a portfolio of student loans that are earning interest at a fixed borrower rate which exceeds the statutorily defined variable lender rate creating fixed rate floor income which is included in its core student loan spread 
the majority of these loans are consolidation loans that earn the greater of the borrower rate or above the average commercial paper rate during the calendar quarter 
when excluding fixed rate floor income  the company s core student loan spread was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the compression of the company s core student loan spread during the year ended december  compared to was the result of the following items the passage of the college cost reduction act has reduced the yield on all ffelp loans originated after october  historically  the movement of the various interest rate indices received on the company s student loan assets and paid on the debt to fund such loans was highly correlated 
as shown in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  the short term movement of the indices was dislocated beginning in august this dislocation has had a negative impact on the company s student loan net interest income 
the spread to libor on asset backed securities transactions has increased significantly since august since august  the company has issued billion of notes in asset backed securities transactions billion in august  billion in march  billion in april  and billion in may 
the increase in costs on these transactions from historical levels have had and will continue to have a negative impact on the company s student loan net interest income 
the increased spread to libor on asset backed securities transactions is shown in the below table line graph the interest rates on approximately billion of the company s asset backed securities are set and periodically reset via a dutch auction 
beginning in february  the auction process to establish the rates on the auction rate securities has failed 
as a result of a failed auction  the auction rate securities will generally pay interest to the holder at a maximum rate as defined by the governing documents 
during  the company paid unfavorable interest rates on the majority of its auction rate securities as a result of the application of certain of these maximum rate auction provisions in the underlying documents for such financings 
the compression of the company s core student loan spread during the year ended december  compared to was the result of the following items the increase in the cost of debt as a result of the disruptions in the debt and secondary capital markets 

table of contents an increase in lower yielding consolidation loans and an increase in the consolidation rebate fees 
the elimination of special allowance payments on non special allowance yield adjustment student loans as a result of the settlement agreement with the department 
the mismatch in the reset frequency between the company s floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities 
the company s core student loan spread benefited in the rising interest rate environment for the first six months in because the company s cost of funds reset periodically on a discrete basis  in advance  while the company s student loans received a yield based on the average daily interest rate over the period 
as interest rates remained relatively flat or decreased during  as compared to the same period in  the company did not benefit from the rate reset discrepancy of its assets and liabilities contributing to the compression

operating expenses 
excluding the restructure and impairment charges  operating expenses decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the company reduced its cost to service loans by converting loan volume acquired during certain acquisitions from third party servicers to the company s servicing platform 
these reductions were offset by an increase in the cost to service loans as a result of loan growth 
liquidity and capital resources the company s fee based businesses are not capital intensive businesses and all of these businesses produce positive operating cash flows 
as such  a minimal amount of debt and equity capital is allocated to these segments 
therefore  the majority of the liquidity and capital resources discussion is concentrated on the company s asset generation and management operating segment 
the company has historically utilized operating cash flow  secured financing transactions which include warehouse facilities and asset backed securitizations  operating lines of credit  and other borrowing arrangements to fund its asset generation and management operations and student loan acquisitions 
in addition  the company uses operating cash flow  borrowings on its unsecured line of credit  and unsecured debt offerings to fund corporate activities  business acquisitions  and repurchases of common stock 
the company has also used its common stock to partially fund certain business acquisitions 
the company has a universal shelf registration statement with the sec which allows the company to sell up to million of securities that may consist of common stock  preferred stock  unsecured debt securities  warrants  stock purchase contracts  and stock purchase units 
the terms of any securities are established at the time of the offering 

table of contents the company may issue equity and debt securities in the future in order to improve capital  increase liquidity  refinance upcoming maturities  or provide for general corporate purposes 
moreover  the company may from time to time repurchase certain amounts of its outstanding debt securities  including debt securities which the company may issue in the future  for cash and or through exchanges for other securities 
such repurchases or exchanges may be made in open market transactions  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
any such repurchases or exchanges will depend on prevailing market conditions  the company s liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions  compliance with securities laws  and other factors 
the amounts involved in any such transactions may be material 
the following table summarizes the company s bonds and notes outstanding as of december  carrying interest rate amount range final maturity variable rate bonds and notes a bonds and notes based on indices bonds and notes based on auction or remarketing b total variable rate bonds and notes commercial paper ffelp facility c commercial paper private loan facility c fixed rate bonds and notes a unsecured fixed rate debt  and and unsecured line of credit department of education participation other borrowings a issued in asset backed securitizations b as of december   the company had million of bonds based on an auction rate of  due to the maximum rate auction provisions in the underlying documents for such financings 
the maximum rate provisions include multiple components  one of which is based on t bill rates 
the t bill component calculation for these bonds produced negative rates  which resulted in auction rates of zero percent for the applicable period 
c loan warehouse facilities secured financing transactions the company has historically relied upon secured financing vehicles as its most significant source of funding for student loans 
the net cash flow the company receives from the securitized student loans generally represents the excess amounts  if any  generated by the underlying student loans over the amounts required to be paid to the bondholders  after deducting servicing fees and any other expenses relating to the securitizations 
the company s rights to cash flow from securitized student loans are subordinate to bondholder interests and may fail to generate any cash flow beyond what is due to bondholders 
the company s secured financing vehicles are loan warehouse facilities  asset backed securitizations  and the government s participation program as described below 
on july   the company did not renew its liquidity provisions on its ffelp loan warehouse facility 
accordingly  the facility became a term facility and no new loan originations could be funded with this facility 
in august  the company accessed alternative sources of funding to originate new ffelp student loans  including the department s loan participation program  and an existing facility with union bank which are further discussed below 
loan warehouse facilities student loan warehousing has historically allowed the company to buy and manage student loans prior to transferring them into more permanent financing arrangements 
the company has historically relied upon three conduit warehouse loan financing vehicles to support its funding needs on a short term basis a multi year committed facility for ffelp loans  a million private loan warehouse for non federally insured student loans  and a single seller extendible commercial paper conduit for ffelp loans 
ffelp warehouse facility the company s multi year committed facility for ffelp loans terminates in may and was supported by day liquidity which was scheduled for renewal on may  the company obtained an extension on this renewal until july  on july   the company did not renew the liquidity provisions of this facility 
accordingly  as of july   the facility became a term facility with a final maturity date of may  pursuant to the terms of the agreement  since liquidity was not renewed  the company s cost of financing under this facility increased basis points 
the agreement also includes provisions which allow the banks to charge a rate equal to libor plus basis points if they choose to finance their portion of the facility with sources of funds other than their commercial paper conduit 
as of december   the company had billion of student loans in the facility and billion borrowed under the facility 

table of contents the terms and conditions of the company s warehouse facility for ffelp loans provides for formula based advance rates based on market conditions 
while the company does not believe that the loan valuation formula is reflective of the actual fair value of its loans  it is subject to compliance with such mark to formula provisions of the warehouse facility agreement 
as of december  and february   the company had a cumulative amount of million and million  respectively  posted as equity funding support for this facility 
the company has utilized its million unsecured line of credit to fund equity advances on its warehouse facility 
as of february   the company had million outstanding under this line of credit 
the unsecured line of credit terminates in may continued dislocations in the credit markets may cause additional volatility in the loan valuation formula 
should a significant change in the valuation of loans result in additional required equity funding support for the warehouse facility greater than what the company can provide  the warehouse facility could be subject to an event of default resulting in a termination of the facility and an acceleration of the repayment provisions 
a default on the ffelp warehouse facility would result in an event of default on the company s unsecured line of credit that would result in the outstanding balance on the line of credit becoming immediately due and payable 
the company continues to look at various alternatives to remove loans from the warehouse facility including other financing arrangements  using unrestricted operating cash  and or selling loans to third parties 
in addition  in january  the department published summary terms under which it will finance eligible ffelp stafford and plus loans in a conduit vehicle established to provide funding for student lenders 
loans eligible for the conduit program must be first disbursed on or after october   but not later than june   and fully disbursed before september   and meet certain other requirements 
funding for the conduit program will be provided by the capital markets at a cost based on market rates 
the conduit program will have a term of five years 
as of december   the company had approximately million of loans included in its warehouse facility that would be eligible for the conduit program 
private loan warehouse facility as of december   the company had million of student loans in its private loan warehouse facility and million borrowed under the facility 
on february   the company paid all debt outstanding on this facility with operating cash and terminated the facility 
commercial paper warehouse program in august  the company established a billion extendable commercial paper warehouse program for ffelp loans  under which it can issue one or more short term extendable secured liquidity notes 
as of december   no notes were outstanding under this warehouse program 
as a result of the disruption of the credit markets  there is no market for the issuance of notes under this facility 
management believes it is currently unlikely a market will exist in the foreseeable future 
asset backed securitizations of the billion of debt outstanding as of december   billion was issued under term asset backed securitizations 
depending on market conditions  the company anticipates continuing to access the asset backed securities market 
as a result of the disruptions in the credit markets  the company may not be able to issue asset backed financings at rates historically achieved by the company  at levels equal to or less than other financing agreements  or at levels otherwise considered beneficial to the company 
accordingly  the company s operational and financial results may be negatively impacted 
securities issued in the securitization transactions are generally priced based upon a spread to libor or set under an auction or remarketing procedure 
libor based notes as of december   the company had billion of notes issued under asset backed securitizations that primarily reprice at a fixed spread to three month libor and are structured to substantially match the maturity of the funded assets 
these notes fund ffelp student loans that are predominantly set based on a spread to three month commercial paper 
the three month libor and three month commercial paper indexes have historically been highly correlated 
based on cash flows developed to reflect management s current estimate of  among other factors  prepayments  defaults  deferment  forbearance  and interest rates  the company currently expects future undiscounted cash flows from these transactions will be approximately billion 
these cash flows consist of net spread and servicing and administrative revenue in excess of estimated cost 
however  due to the unintended consequences of government intervention in the commercial paper markets and limited issuances of qualifying financial commercial paper  the relationship between the three month financial commercial paper and libor rates has been distorted and volatile 
such distortion has had and may continue to have a significant impact on the earnings and cash flows of this portfolio 

table of contents the company has certain libor indexed notes that match the maturity of the funded assets  however  must periodically be remarketed by the company 
upon remarketing  the interest rates on the notes are reset 
the company also has the option to repurchase the notes prior to a failed remarketing and hold the notes as an investment until such time they can be remarketed 
in the event the notes cannot be remarketed and they are not repurchased by the company  the interest rate increases to and remains at month libor plus basis points until such time as they can be successfully remarketed or purchased by the company 
the company has million of notes due to be remarketed on may  and an additional million and million to be remarketed in and  respectively 
auction or remarketing based notes the interest rates on certain of the company s asset backed securities are set and periodically reset via a dutch auction or through a remarketing utilizing remarketing agents 
the company is currently sponsor on approximately billion of auction rate securities and billion of variable rate demand notes 
for auction rate securities  investors and potential investors submit orders through a broker dealer as to the principal amount of notes they wish to buy  hold  or sell at various interest rates 
the broker dealers submit their clients orders to the auction agent  who then determines the clearing interest rate for the upcoming period 
interest rates on these auction rate securities are reset periodically  generally every to days  by the auction agent or agents 
during the first quarter of  as part of the credit market crisis  auction rate securities from various issuers failed to receive sufficient order interest from potential investors to clear successfully  resulting in failed auction status 
since february   the company s auction rate securities have failed in this manner 
under normal conditions  banks have historically purchased these securities when investor demand is weak 
however  since february  banks have been allowing auctions to fail 
currently  all of the company s auction rate securities are in a failed auction status and the company believes they will remain in a failed status for an extended period of time and possibly permanently 
as a result of a failed auction  the auction rate securities will generally pay interest to the holder at a maximum rate as defined by the indenture 
while these rates will vary  they will generally be based on a spread to libor or treasury securities 
based on the relative levels of these indices as of december   the rates expected to be paid by the company range from day t bill plus basis points  on the low end  to libor plus basis points  on the high end 
these maximum rates are subject to increase if the credit ratings on the bonds are downgraded 
the company cannot predict whether future auctions related to its auction rate securities will be successful  but management believes it is likely auctions will continue to fail indefinitely 
the company is currently seeking alternatives for reducing its exposure to the auction rate market  but may not be able to achieve alternate financing for some or all of its auction rate securities 
for variable rate demand notes  the remarketing agents set the price  which is then offered to investors 
if there are insufficient potential bid orders to purchase all of the notes offered for sale  the company could be subject to interest costs substantially above the anticipated and historical rates paid on these types of securities 
the maximum rate for variable rate demand notes is based on a spread to certain indexes as defined in the underlying documents  with the highest to the company being prime plus basis points 
funding new ffelp student loan originations historically  the company funded new loan originations using loan warehouse facilities and asset backed securitizations 
student loan warehousing has historically allowed the company to buy and manage student loans prior to transferring them into more permanent financing arrangements 
in july  the company did not renew its liquidity provisions on its ffelp warehouse facility 
accordingly  the facility became a term facility and no new loan originations could be funded with this facility 
in august  the company began funding ffelp stafford and plus student loan originations for the academic year pursuant to the department s loan participation program and participation agreement with union bank 
department of education s loan participation and purchase commitment programs in august  the department implemented the loan purchase commitment program and the loan participation program pursuant to the ecasla 
under the department s purchase program  the department will purchase loans at a price equal to the sum of i par value  ii accrued interest  iii the one percent origination fee paid to the department  and iv a fixed amount of per loan 
under the participation program  the department provides interim short term liquidity to ffelp lenders by purchasing participation interests in pools of ffelp loans 
ffelp lenders are charged a rate of commercial paper plus basis points on the principal amount of participation interests outstanding 
loans funded under the participation program must be either refinanced by the lender or sold to the department pursuant to the purchase program prior to its expiration on september  to be eligible for purchase or participation under the department s programs  loans were originally limited to ffelp stafford or plus loans made for the academic year  first disbursed between may  and july   with eligible borrower benefits 

table of contents on october   legislation was enacted to extend the department s authority to address ffelp student loans made for the academic year and allowing for the extension of the participation program and purchase program from september  to september  the department indicated that loans for the academic year which are funded under the department s participation program will need to be refinanced or sold to the department prior to september  on november   the department announced the replication of the terms of the participation and purchase program  in accordance with the october th legislation  which will include ffelp student loans made for the academic year 
as of december   the company had million of ffelp loans funded using the participation program 
the company plans to continue to use the participation program to fund loans originated for the and academic years 
these programs are allowing the company to continue originating new federal student loans to all students regardless of the school they attend 
as of february   the company had billion of ffelp loans funded using the participation program 
union bank participation agreement the company maintains an agreement with union bank  as trustee for various grantor trusts  under which union bank has agreed to purchase from the company participation interests in student loans the ffelp participation agreement 
the company has the option to purchase the participation interests from the grantor trusts at the end of a day period upon termination of the participation certificate 
as of december   million of loans were subject to outstanding participation interests held by union bank  as trustee  under this agreement 
the agreement automatically renews annually and is terminable by either party upon five business days notice 
this agreement provides beneficiaries of union bank s grantor trusts with access to investments in interests in student loans  while providing liquidity to the company on a short term basis 
the company can participate loans to union bank to the extent of availability under the grantor trusts  up to million 
loans participated under this agreement qualify as a sale pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas no 

accordingly  the participation interests sold are not included on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
unsecured operating line of credit the company has a million unsecured line of credit that terminates in may as of december   there was million outstanding on this line and million available for future use 
the weighted average interest rate on this line of credit was as of december  upon termination in  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain this line of credit  find alternative funding  or increase the amount outstanding under the line  if necessary 
as discussed previously  the company may need to fund certain loans or provide additional equity funding support related to advance rates on its warehouse facilities 
as of february   the company has contributed million in equity funding support to these facilities 
the company has funded these contributions primarily by advances on its operating line of credit 
as of february   the company has million outstanding under this line of credit 
the lending commitment under the company s unsecured line of credit is provided by a total of thirteen banks  with no individual bank representing more than of the total lending commitment 
the bank lending group includes lehman brothers bank  a subsidiary of lehman brothers holdings inc  which represents approximately of the lending commitment under the line of credit 
on september   lehman brothers holdings inc filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
since the bankruptcy filing  the company has experienced funding delays from lehman and does not expect lehman to fund future borrowing requests 
as of february   excluding lehman bank s lending commitment  the company had million available for future use under its unsecured line of credit 
the line of credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that  if not met  lead to an event of default under the agreement 
the covenants include maintaining i a minimum consolidated net worth ii a minimum adjusted ebitda to corporate debt interest over the last four rolling quarters iii a limitation on subsidiary indebtedness iv a limitation on the percentage of non guaranteed loans in the company s portfolio as of december   the company was in compliance with all of these requirements 
many of these covenants are duplicated in the company s other lending facilities  including its ffelp and private loan warehouses 
as previously discussed  continued dislocations in the credit markets may cause additional volatility in the loan valuation formula included in the company s ffelp warehouse facility 
should a significant change in the valuation of loans result in additional required equity funding support for the warehouse facility greater than what the company can provide  the warehouse facility could be subject to an event of default resulting in a termination of the facility and an acceleration of the repayment provisions 
a default on the ffelp warehouse facility would result in an event of default on the company s unsecured line of credit that would result in the outstanding balance on the line of credit becoming immediately due and payable 

table of contents the company s operating line of credit does not have any covenants related to unsecured debt ratings 
however  changes in the company s ratings as well as the amounts the company borrows have modest implications on the pricing level at which the company obtains funding

the company has commitments with its branding partners and forward flow lenders which obligate the company to purchase loans originated under specific criteria  although the branding partners and forward flow lenders are typically not obligated to provide the company with a minimum amount of loans 
these commitments generally run for periods ranging from one to five years and are generally renewable 
the company has significant financing needs that it meets through the capital markets  including the debt and secondary markets 
since august  these markets have experienced unprecedented disruptions  which are having an adverse impact on the company s earnings and financial condition

b the company also has restricted cash and investments  however  the company is limited in the amounts of funds that can be transferred from its subsidiaries through intercompany loans  advances  or cash dividends

critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
note of the consolidated financial statements  which are included in this report  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are most critical that is  they are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and they require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has identified the following critical accounting policies that are discussed in more detail below allowance for loan losses  revenue recognition  purchase price accounting related to business and certain asset acquisitions  and income taxes 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses on student loans 
this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments 
the company evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on its federally insured loan portfolio separately from its non federally insured loan portfolio 
the allowance for the federally insured loan portfolio is based on periodic evaluations of the company s loan portfolios considering past experience  trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors  changes to federal student loan programs  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the level of the company s future provision for loan losses 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on the non federally insured loans  the company considers several factors including loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status  months in repayment  delinquency status  type of program  and trends in defaults in the portfolio based on company and industry data 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the level of the company s future provision for loan losses 
the company places a non federally insured loan on nonaccrual status and charges off the loan when the collection of principal and interest is days past due 
the allowance for federally insured and non federally insured loans is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
revenue recognition student loan income the company recognizes student loan income as earned  net of amortization of loan premiums and deferred origination costs 
loan income is recognized based upon the expected yield of the loan after giving effect to borrower utilization of incentives such as principal reductions for timely payments borrower benefits and other yield adjustments 
the estimate of the borrower benefits discount is dependent on the estimate of the number of borrowers who will eventually qualify for these benefits 
for competitive and liquidity purposes  the company frequently changes the borrower benefit programs in both amount and qualification factors 
these programmatic changes must be reflected in the estimate of the borrower benefit discount 
loan premiums  deferred origination costs  and borrower benefits are included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized over the estimated life of the loan in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for non refundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
the most sensitive estimate for loan premiums  deferred origination costs  and borrower benefits is the estimate of the constant prepayment rate cpr 
cpr is a variable in the life of loan estimate that measures the rate at which loans in a portfolio pay before their stated maturity 
the cpr is directly correlated to the average life of the portfolio 
cpr equals the percentage of loans that prepay annually as a percentage of the beginning of period balance 
a number of factors can affect the cpr estimate such as the rate of consolidation activity and default rates 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the amount of loan premium and deferred origination cost amortization recognized by the company in a particular period 

table of contents other fee based income other fee based income is primarily attributable to fees for providing services and the sale of lists and print products 
fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company s service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties 
revenue from the sale of lists and print products is generally earned and recognized  net of estimated returns  upon shipment or delivery 
the company assesses collectability of revenues and its allowance for doubtful accounts based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is established to record accounts receivable at estimated net realizable value 
if the company determines that collection of revenues is not reasonably assured at or prior to delivery of the company s services  revenue is recognized upon the receipt of cash 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessments the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is considered not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then the company must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then the company would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions  and determination of appropriate market comparables 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
the company makes judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets annually and whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment may exist 
each quarter the company evaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of the company s intangible and other long lived assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in the company s business strategy and internal forecasts 
although the company believes the historical assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the reported financial results 
income taxes the company is subject to the income tax laws of the u 
s and its states and municipalities in which the company operates 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  the company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 
the company must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
the company reviews these balances quarterly and as new information becomes available  the balances are adjusted  as appropriate

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure arises from fluctuations in its borrowing and lending rates  the spread between which could impact the company due to shifts in market interest rates 
because the company generates a significant portion of its earnings from its student loan spread  the interest sensitivity of the balance sheet is a key profitability driver 
the following table sets forth the company s loan assets and debt instruments by rate characteristics as of december  as of december  dollars percent dollars percent fixed rate loan assets variable rate loan assets total fixed rate debt instruments variable rate debt instruments total loans originated prior to april  generally earn interest at the higher of a floating rate based on the special allowance payment or sap formula set by the department and the borrower rate  which is fixed over a period of time 
the sap formula is based on an applicable index plus a fixed spread that is dependent upon when the loan was originated  the loan s repayment status  and funding sources for the loan 
the company generally finances its student loan portfolio with variable rate debt 
in low and or declining interest rate environments  when the fixed borrower rate is higher than the rate produced by the sap formula  the company s student loans earn at a fixed rate while the interest on the variable rate debt typically continues to decline 
in these interest rate environments  the company may earn additional spread income that it refers to as floor income 
depending on the type of loan and when it was originated  the borrower rate is either fixed to term or is reset to an annual rate each july as a result  for loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term  the company may earn floor income for an extended period of time  which the company refers to as fixed rate floor income  and for those loans where the borrower rate is reset annually on july  the company may earn floor income to the next reset date  which the company refers to as variable rate floor income 
in accordance with new legislation enacted in  lenders are required to rebate fixed rate floor income and variable rate floor income to the department for all new ffelp loans first originated on or after april  for the years ended december    and  loan interest income includes approximately million  million  and million of fixed rate floor income  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  loan interest income includes approximately million and million of variable rate floor income  respectively 
the company did not earn variable rate floor income in the year ended december  absent the use of derivative instruments  a rise in interest rates may reduce the amount of floor income received and this may have an impact on earnings due to interest margin compression caused by increasing financing costs  until such time as the federally insured loans earn interest at a variable rate in accordance with their special allowance payment formulas 
in higher interest rate environments  where the interest rate rises above the borrower rate and fixed rate loans effectively become variable rate loans  the impact of the rate fluctuations is reduced 

table of contents the following graph depicts fixed rate floor income for a borrower with a fixed rate of and a sap rate of graph the following table shows the company s student loan assets that are earning fixed rate floor income as of december  borrower estimated balance of fixed lender variable assets earning fixed rate interest weighted conversion floor income as of rate range average yield rate a december  b less than a the estimated variable conversion rate is the estimated short term interest rate at which loans would convert to variable rate 
b as of december   the company had million of fixed rate debt that was used by the company to hedge fixed rate student loan assets 
the weighted average interest rate paid by the company on this debt as of december  was 
as of december   the company had billion of student loan assets that were eligible to earn variable rate floor income 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk because the interest rate characteristics of the company s assets do not match the interest rate characteristics of the funding 
the company attempts to match the interest rate characteristics of certain pools of loan assets with debt instruments of substantially similar characteristics 
due to the variability in duration of the company s assets and varying market conditions  the company does not attempt to perfectly match the interest rate characteristics of the entire loan portfolio with the underlying debt instruments 
the company has adopted a policy of periodically reviewing the mismatch related to the interest rate characteristics of its assets and liabilities together with the company s outlook as to current and future market conditions 
based on those factors  the company uses derivative instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy 
derivative instruments used as part of the company s interest rate risk management strategy currently include interest rate swaps  basis swaps  and cross currency swaps 

table of contents the following table presents the company s ffelp student loan assets and related funding arranged by underlying indices as of december  debt outstanding that funded frequency of student loan index e variable resets assets assets a month h financial commercial paper b daily   month treasury bill varies  month libor c quarterly  auction rate or remarketing varies  asset backed commercial paper varies  fixed rate other d a the company has certain basis swaps outstanding in which the company i receives three month libor set discretely in advance and pays a daily weighted average three month libor less a spread as defined in the individual agreements average discrete basis swaps  and ii receives three month libor and pays one month libor basis swaps 
the company entered into these derivative instruments to better match the interest rate characteristics on its student loan assets and the debt funding such assets 
the following table summarizes these derivatives as of december  notional amount average discrete basis maturity basis swaps swaps b the company s ffelp student loans earn interest based on the daily average h financial commercial paper index calculated on a fiscal quarter 
the company s funding includes ffelp student loans under the department s participation program 
due to the unintended consequences of government intervention in the commercial paper markets and limited issuances of qualifying financial commercial paper  the relationship between the three month financial cp and libor rates has been distorted and volatile 
to address this issue  the department announced that for purposes of calculating the ffelp loan index from october  to december   the federal reserve s commercial paper funding facility rate was used for those days in which no three month financial commercial paper rate was available 
this resulted in a cp libor spread of basis points in the fourth quarter of compared to basis points in the third quarter of the cp libor spread would have been basis points in the fourth quarter of if the department had not addressed the issue by using the federal reserve s commercial paper funding facility rates discussed above 
there are no assurances that the department will utilize a similar methodology for the first quarter of or in the future 
c the company has euro denominated notes that reprice on the euribor index 
the company has entered into derivative instruments cross currency interest rate swaps that convert the euribor index to month libor 
as a result  these notes are reflected in the month libor category in the above table

d assets include restricted cash and investments and other assets

the net settlements on these derivatives are included in interest rate swaps other 
in august  the company terminated these derivatives for net proceeds of million 
settlements on the special allowance derivatives prior to entering into the off setting derivatives discussed above were classified in the special allowance yield adjustment derivatives line item through september  b during  the company issued junior subordinated hybrid securities and entered into a derivative instrument to economically lock into a fixed interest rate prior to the actual pricing of the transaction 
upon pricing of these notes  the company terminated the derivative instrument 
the consideration paid by the company to terminate this derivative was million

as a result of this transaction  the company is exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and euro 
the principal and accrued interest on these notes is re measured at each reporting period and recorded on the company s balance sheet in us dollars based on the foreign currency exchange rate on that date

the company entered into cross currency interest rate swaps in connection with the issuance of the euro notes 
under the terms of these derivative instrument agreements  the company receives from a counterparty a spread to the euribor index based on notional amounts of million and million and pays a spread to the libor index based on notional amounts of million and million  respectively 
in addition  under the terms of these agreements  all principal payments on the euro notes will effectively be paid at the exchange rate in effect as of the issuance of the notes 
the company did not qualify these derivative instruments as hedges under sfas no 
 consequently  the change in fair value is included in the company s operating results 

table of contents for the year ended december   the company recorded income of million as a result of re measurement of the euro notes and a loss of million for the change in the fair value of the related derivative instrument 
for the years ended december  and  the company recorded losses of million and million  respectively  as a result of the re measurement of the euro notes and income of million and million  respectively  for the change in the fair value of the related derivative instrument 
these amounts are included in derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the company s consolidated statements of income 
the re measurement of the euro denominated bonds correlates with the change in fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps 
however  the company will experience unrealized gains or losses related to the cross currency interest rate swaps if the two underlying indices and related forward curve do not move in parallel 
management intends to hold the cross currency interest rate swaps through the maturity of the euro denominated bonds
