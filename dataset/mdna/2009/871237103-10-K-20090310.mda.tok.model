table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are generally cash flows generated by operating activities and from available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
we utilize these capital resources to make capital expenditures associated primarily with our customer contact management services  invest in technology applications and tools to further develop our service offerings and for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including repurchase of our common stock in the open market and to fund possible acquisitions 
in future periods  we intend similar uses of these funds 
on august   the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to three million shares of our outstanding common stock 
a total of million shares have been repurchased under this program since inception 
the shares are purchased  from time to time  through open market purchases or in negotiated private transactions  and the purchases are based on factors  including but not limited to  the stock price and general market conditions 
during  we repurchased thousand common shares under the repurchase program at a price of per share for a total cost of million 
we expect to make additional stock repurchases under this program in if market conditions are favorable

capital expenditures  which are generally funded by cash generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our credit facilities  were million for  compared to million for  an increase of million 
during  approximately of the capital expenditures were the result of investing in new and existing customer contact management centers  primarily offshore  and was expended primarily for maintenance and systems infrastructure 
in  we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of million to million 
an available source of future cash flows from financing activities is from borrowings under our million revolving credit facility the credit facility  which amount is subject to certain borrowing limitations 
pursuant to the terms of the credit facility  the amount of million may be increased up to a maximum of million with the prior written consent of the lenders 
the million credit facility includes a million swingline subfacility  a million letter of credit subfacility and a million multi currency subfacility 
the credit facility  which includes certain financial covenants  may be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions  share repurchases  working capital support  and letters of credit  subject to certain limitations

the credit facility prohibits the company from incurring additional indebtedness  subject to certain specific exclusions 
there were no 
table of contents borrowings in and no outstanding balances as of december   with million availability on the credit facility 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
at december   the aggregate amount of assets requiring fair value measurement no liabilities included in level represented approximately of the aggregate amount of consolidated assets and liabilities 
of the aggregate amount of total assets and liabilities requiring fair value measurement  approximately are included in level the amount we report in level in future periods will be directly affected by market conditions 
there were no material changes made to the valuation techniques and methodologies used to measure fair value during see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information related to the adoption of sfas and item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further information regarding foreign currency risk 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  of which approximately or million  was held in international operations and may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the united states 
we believe that our current cash levels  short term investments  accessible funds under our credit facilities and cash flows from future operations will be adequate to meet anticipated working capital needs  future debt repayment requirements if any  continued expansion objectives  funding of potential acquisitions  anticipated levels of capital expenditures and contractual obligations for the foreseeable future and stock repurchases 
off balance sheet arrangements and other at december   we did not have any material commercial commitments  including guarantees or standby repurchase obligations  or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
from time to time  during the normal course of business  we may make certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include  but are not limited to i indemnities to clients  vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct and ii indemnities involving breach of contract  the accuracy of representations and warranties  or other liabilities assumed by us in certain contracts 
in addition  we have agreements whereby we will indemnify certain officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the applicable insurance coverage is generally adequate to cover any estimated potential liability under these indemnification agreements 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and other guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  we have some client contracts that do not contain contractual provisions for the limitation of liability  and other client contracts that contain agreed upon exceptions to limitation of liability 
we have not recorded any liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets with respect to any client contracts under which we have or may have unlimited liability

long term tax liabilities include uncertain tax positions and related penalties and interest as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the cash settlement of these long term liabilities with the taxing authority  therefore  amounts have been excluded from payments due by period 
amounts represent estimated obligations related to forward contracts as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these amounts will fluctuate with movements in the underlying market price of the forward contracts 
other long term liabilities  which exclude deferred income taxes  represent the expected cash payments due under pension obligations and minority shareholders of certain subsidiaries 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimations that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results recognition of revenue we recognize revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards  including sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  sab  revenue recognition and the emerging issues task force eitf no 
 eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
sab  as amended  and sab summarize certain of the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements and provide guidance on revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry 
eitf provides further guidance on how to account for multiple element contracts 
we primarily recognize revenue from services as the services are performed  which is based on either on a per minute  per call or per transaction basis  under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenue for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies 
revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery 
table of contents of any future product or service or meeting other specified performance conditions 
product sales  accounted for within our fulfillment services  are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations 
revenue from contracts with multiple deliverables is allocated to separate units of accounting based on their relative fair value  if the deliverables in the contract s meet the criteria for such treatment 
certain fulfillment services contracts contain multiple deliverables 
additionally  we had a contract containing multiple deliverables for customer contact management services and fulfillment services that ended in separation criteria included whether a delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and  if the arrangement includes a general right of return related to a delivered item  whether delivery of the undelivered item is considered probable and in our control 
fair value is the price of a deliverable when it is regularly sold on a stand alone basis  which generally consists of vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
if there is no evidence of the fair value for a delivered product or service  revenue is allocated first to the fair value of the undelivered product or service and then the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered product or service 
if there is no evidence of the fair value for an undelivered product or service  the contract s is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  resulting in delay of revenue recognition for the delivered product or service until the undelivered product or service portion of the contract is complete 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known  uncertainties regarding client acceptance are resolved  and there are no client negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements 
once we determine the allocation of revenue between deliverable elements  there are no further changes in the revenue allocation 
if the separation criteria are met  revenue from these services is recognized as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement 
if the separation criteria are not met because there is insufficient evidence to determine fair value of one of the deliverables  all of the services are accounted for as a single combined unit of accounting 
for these deliverables with insufficient evidence to determine fair value  revenue is recognized on the proportional performance method using the straight line basis over the contract period  or the actual number of operational seats used to serve the client  as appropriate 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts of million as of december   or of trade account receivables  for estimated losses arising from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our estimate is based on factors surrounding the credit risk of certain clients  historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable 
it is reasonably possible that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in a reduced ability to make payments 
income taxes we reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence for each respective tax jurisdiction  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction is allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that jurisdiction on a pro rata basis 
available evidence which is considered in determining the amount of valuation allowance required includes  but is not limited to  our estimate of future taxable income and any applicable tax planning strategies 
in september   the company determined that its profitability and expectations of future profitability of certain foreign subsidiaries indicated that it was more likely than not that portions of the deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  in the third quarter of  the company recognized an increase in its deferred tax assets of million through a partial reversal of the valuation allowance 
as of december   management determined that a valuation allowance of million was necessary to reduce us deferred tax assets by million and foreign deferred tax assets by million  where it was more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recoverability of the remaining net deferred tax asset of million at december  is dependent upon future profitability within each tax jurisdiction 
as of december   based on our estimates of future taxable income and any applicable tax planning strategies within various tax jurisdictions  we believe that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax asset will be realized 
it is reasonably possible that the company will be required to release up to million of valuation allowance during pursuant to the requirements of fasb statement no

fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb no 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas first  tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
second  the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january  and recognized a million liability for unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  which was accounted for as a reduction to the january  balance of retained earnings 
this adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings includes million related to transfer pricing penalties that may be assessed in connection with an income tax audit of our indian subsidiary 
upon adoption of fin as of january   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits including million of net operating loss carryforwards that were previously recognized as deferred tax assets with a full valuation allowance 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  a net decrease of million from million as of december  this decrease relates primarily to the recognition of tax benefits related to transfer pricing as a result of favorable tax audits 
if we recognized these tax benefits  approximately million and related interest and penalties would favorably impact the effective tax rate 
we believe it is reasonably possible that these unrecognized tax benefits will decrease or be recognized in the next twelve months by up to million due to the resolution of audits and appeals in various tax jurisdictions 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  which had a carrying value of million as of december   including goodwill  intangibles  property and equipment  and investment in shps  incorporated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and at least annually for impairment testing of goodwill 
an asset is considered to be impaired when the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
upon determination that the carrying value of the asset is impaired  we would record an impairment charge or loss to reduce the asset to its fair value 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and  therefore  might require an impairment charge in the future

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in non us currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to non us exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  those results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the cumulative translation effects for subsidiaries using functional currencies other than the us dollar are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
movements in non us currency exchange rates may negatively or positively affect our competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors 
periodically  we use foreign currency contracts to hedge intercompany receivables and payables  and transactions initiated in the united states that are denominated in foreign currency 
we serve a number of us based clients using customer contact management center capacity in the philippines which is within our americas segment 
although the contracts with these clients are priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in philippine pesos php  which represent a foreign exchange exposure 
in order to hedge approximately of our exposure related to the anticipated cash flow requirements denominated in php  we had outstanding forward contracts as of december  with counterparties to acquire a total of php billion through december at fixed prices of million us dollars 
as of december   we had net total derivative liabilities associated with these contracts of million  which will settle within the next months 
the fair value of these derivative instruments as of december  is presented in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
if the us dollar was to weaken against the php by from current period end levels  we would incur a loss of approximately million on the underlying exposures of the derivative instruments 
however  this loss would be partially offset by a corresponding gain of approximately million in our underlying exposures 
in february  we entered into an additional forward contract to sell php million at fixed prices of euro million through april to hedge an intercompany loan payment denominated in php 
we evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk results from variable debt outstanding under our million revolving credit facility 
during the year ended december   we had no debt outstanding under this credit facility  therefore  a one point increase in the weighted average interest rate  which generally equals the libor rate plus an applicable margin  would not have had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we have not historically used derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates
