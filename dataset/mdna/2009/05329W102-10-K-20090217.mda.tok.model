item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with part i  including matters set forth in the risk factors section of this form k  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii  item of this form k 
certain reclassifications of amounts previously reported have been made to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in order to maintain consistency and comparability between periods presented 
except to the extent that differences among operating segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole  we present the discussion in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on a consolidated basis 
overview autonation  inc  through its subsidiaries  is the largest automotive retailer in the united states 
as of december   we owned and operated new vehicle franchises from stores located in major metropolitan markets  predominantly in the sunbelt region of the united states 
our stores  which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets  sell different brands of new vehicles 
the core brands of vehicles that we sell  representing approximately of the new vehicles that we sold in  are manufactured by toyota  ford  honda  nissan  general motors  daimler  bmw  and chrysler 
we offer a diversified range of automotive products and services  including new vehicles  used vehicles  parts and automotive repair and maintenance services  and automotive finance and insurance products 
we also arrange financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources 
we believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by  among other things  leveraging our market brands and advertising  improving asset management  implementing standardized processes  and increasing productivity across all of our stores 
as of december   we had three operating segments domestic  import  and premium luxury 
our domestic segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured by general motors  ford  and chrysler 
our import segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by toyota  honda  and nissan 
our premium luxury segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by mercedes  bmw  and lexus 
the franchises in each segment also sell used vehicles  parts and automotive repair and maintenance services  and automotive finance and insurance products 
see segment results below and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our operating segments 
for the year ended december   new vehicle sales account for approximately of our total revenue  but approximately of our total gross margin 
our parts and service and finance and insurance operations  while comprising approximately of total revenue  contribute approximately of our gross margin 
we had a net loss from continuing operations of billion and diluted loss per share of in  as compared to net income from continuing operations of million and diluted earnings per share of in the results were impacted by a non cash goodwill impairment charge of billion billion after tax  non cash franchise impairments of million million after tax  a favorable tax adjustment of approximately million  and a gain on senior note repurchases of million million after tax 
see further discussion of these items in note   and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the results included favorable tax adjustments of million 
market challenges our results of operations for reflected a challenging and volatile automotive retail market impacted by the unfavorable economic conditions in the united states  including the continued turbulence in the credit and housing markets 
volatility in fuel prices impacted consumer preferences and caused dramatic swings in consumer demand for various vehicle models  which led to supply and demand imbalances 
additionally  tight credit conditions limited the ability of some of our customers to purchase vehicles as well as finance and insurance products 
in the fourth quarter of  the seasonally adjusted annual rate saar of new vehicle sales in the united states was million 
in comparison  full year us industry new vehicle sales were million in and million in industry analysts expect that the saar will be in the range of million new vehicle units with weakness in the first half of the year 
based on these expectations  we believe that we will be able to manage within all financial covenants in our debt agreements 
see liquidity and capital resources restrictions and covenants below 
while the domestic manufacturers have underperformed relative to their import and premium luxury competitors over the past several years  the performance gap widened in  due in part to the unfavorable economic conditions in the united states  which disproportionately impacted the domestic manufacturers 
recent government assistance has been provided to certain domestic manufacturers  but the future viability of some or all of the domestic manufacturers may be dependent on additional government assistance 
the bankruptcy of one or more of the domestic manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on us 
for example  the manufacturers could attempt to terminate our floorplan financing and all or certain of our domestic franchises  we may be unable to collect accounts receivable from the manufacturers  and we may be required to incur impairment charges with respect to the inventory  fixed assets  and intangible assets related to our domestic franchises 
at december   we had approximately million in accounts receivable  million of inventory  million of fixed assets  and million of goodwill and other intangible assets related to our domestic franchises 
additionally  there are uncertainties surrounding the potential impact of a domestic manufacturer bankruptcy  such as the impact on warranties provided to vehicle purchasers and the availability of parts and services needed to maintain and repair vehicles 
as a result  the impact of such a bankruptcy on our financial condition and results of operations is not determinable at this time 
see the risk factor we are dependent upon the success and continued financial viability of the vehicle manufacturers and distributors with which we hold franchises in part i  item a of this form k 
as part of our continuing response to the ongoing market challenges  in july  we announced a cost reduction plan with a targeted annualized run rate savings of approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  in response to the turmoil in the credit markets and the related impact on the automotive retail market  we expanded our cost reduction plan and implemented additional actions that enabled us to reduce our annualized costs by an additional million 
accordingly  at december   we had reduced our costs by approximately million on an annualized run rate basis 
inventory management our new and used vehicle inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market in our consolidated balance sheets 
we have generally not experienced losses on the sale of new vehicle inventory  in part due to incentives provided by manufacturers to promote sales of new vehicles and our inventory management practices 
we reduced our new vehicle inventory to  units at december   from  units at december  although we focus on managing our inventory levels in accordance with consumer demand  we believe we must maintain a minimum level of inventory at our lower volume stores that is representative of the full line of vehicles offered by manufacturers 
this may result in a higher days supply of inventory than would otherwise result if we were in a better economic environment 
however  given our inventory management practices such as managing our inventory purchases based on our sales forecasts and sharing inventory among stores within a local market  we do not believe the current business climate is likely to result in material impairment charges related to new vehicle inventory subject to the risks noted in market challenges above 
we continue to monitor our new vehicle inventory levels closely based on current economic conditions and will adjust them as appropriate 
in general  used vehicles that are not sold on a retail basis are liquidated at wholesale auctions 
we record estimated losses on used vehicle inventory expected to be liquidated at wholesale auctions at a loss 
our used vehicle inventory balance was net of cumulative write downs of million at december   and million at december  parts  accessories  and other inventory are carried at the lower of acquisition cost first in  first out method or market 
we estimate the amount of potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience and market trends 
our parts  accessories  and other inventory balance was net of cumulative write downs of million at december   and million at december  critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations  based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and franchise rights assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  during  we recorded billion billion after tax of non cash goodwill impairment charges and million million after tax of non cash impairment charges related to franchise rights intangible assets 
despite these impairment charges  as of december   we were in compliance with the requirements of all applicable financial covenants under our debt agreements  as further discussed below in liquidity and capital resources restrictions and covenants 
as a result of the change in our operating segment structure described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we were required to reassess the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
this reassessment resulted in a conclusion that our reporting units were comprised of three operating segments domestic  import  and premium luxury 
we are required to complete interim tests for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets when events occur or circumstances change between annual tests that indicate that the assets might be impaired 
we continue to face a challenging automotive retail environment and an uncertain economic environment in general 
as a result of these conditions  there can be no assurance that an additional material impairment charge will not occur in a future period 
we will continue to monitor events in future periods to determine if additional asset impairment testing should be performed 
if we are required to apply the second step of the goodwill impairment test to the goodwill in any of our three reporting units in future periods  we believe that we could incur another significant non cash impairment charge related to goodwill  which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements and on our ability to satisfy the financial ratios or other covenants under our debt and other agreements 
the goodwill impairment analysis is dependent on many variables used to determine fair value of the company overall and the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities 
please see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the valuation methods and related estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing 
the complexity of the analysis does not permit a simplistic determination of the impact of changes in assumptions 
we believe that the most significant impact of a change in the assumptions used in determining our goodwill impairment as of september   would have related to the amount of impairment associated with our domestic reporting unit  and that a relatively small change in assumptions could have resulted in two potentially different outcomes if the assumptions used primarily regarding expected future cash flows were slightly more favorable  we would possibly not have impaired the goodwill associated with our domestic reporting unit  or if the assumptions used had been slightly less favorable  it is possible we would have concluded that most  if not all  of the goodwill associated with the domestic reporting unit would have been impaired 
this discussion is not intended to address all potential outcomes that could have resulted if different assumptions had been used in determining our goodwill impairment given the number of assumptions used in determining the impairment and the degree of sensitivity in the determination of the fair value of the company and its assets and liabilities to changes in such assumptions 
we would have been in compliance with the financial covenants in our debt agreements even if we had impaired all of the goodwill associated with our domestic reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of franchise rights primarily using a discounted cash flow dcf model 
the forecasted cash flows used in the dcf model contain inherent uncertainties  including significant estimates and assumptions related to growth rates  margins  working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and cost of capital  for which we utilize certain market participant based assumptions  using third party industry projections  economic projections  and other marketplace data we believe to be reasonable 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that our franchise rights become impaired due to decreases in the fair value of the related underlying business 
the risk of a franchise rights impairment loss may increase to the extent that a store s earnings or projected growth rates decline 
our franchise rights  which related to franchises and totaled million at december   are evaluated on a franchise by franchise basis 
we recorded impairment charges of million during related to rights under certain franchise agreements 
if the fair value of each of our franchise rights had been determined to be a hypothetical lower as of the valuation date of september   the resulting incremental charge would have been less than million 
long lived assets we estimate the depreciable lives of our property and equipment  including leasehold improvements  and review them for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if  based on market conditions  the values of these assets should be adjusted 
although we believe our property and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued  the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets 
during  we recorded million of non cash impairment charges related to our property and equipment  including property held for sale  to reduce the value of these assets to fair market value 
these charges are recorded as a component of other expenses income  net in the consolidated income statements 
chargeback reserve revenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for i loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed and ii vehicle protection products sold 
we primarily sell these products on a straight commission basis  however we also participate in future underwriting profit on certain extended service contracts pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements  which are recognized as earned 
we may be charged back for commissions related to financing  insurance  or vehicle protection products in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers chargebacks 
these commissions are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles  net of an estimated liability for chargebacks 
we estimate our liability for chargebacks on an individual product basis using our historical chargeback experience  based primarily on cancellation data we receive from third parties that sell and administer these products 
our estimated liability for chargebacks totaled million at december   and million at december  chargebacks are influenced by increases or decreases in early termination rates resulting from cancellation of vehicle protection products  defaults  refinancings  payoffs before maturity  and other factors 
while we consider these factors in the estimation of our chargeback liability  actual events may differ from our estimates  which could result in a change in our estimated liability for chargebacks 
a change in our estimated chargebacks would have changed our estimated liability for chargebacks at december   by approximately million 
see finance and insurance below and note of the notes to consolidated finance statements for further information regarding chargeback liabilities 
revenue recognition revenue consists of the sales of new and used vehicles  commissions from related finance and insurance products  sales of parts and services  and sales of other products 
we recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided 
we recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed  the vehicle has been delivered  and payment has been received or financing has been arranged 
rebates  holdbacks  floorplan assistance  and certain other dealer credits received from manufacturers are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program  whichever is later 
income taxes accounting for our income taxes requires significant judgment in the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions and in the calculation of our provision for income taxes 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate available evidence to determine if it appears more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained on an audit by a taxing authority  based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settling the uncertain tax position 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  the ultimate outcome of these tax matters may differ from our expectations 
we adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the completion of a tax audit  expiration of a statute of limitations  the refinement of an estimate  and interest accruals associated with uncertain tax positions until they are resolved 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
our unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by approximately million net of tax effect as a result of the expiration of a statute of limitations in october our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our deferred tax assets or liabilities  the valuation of our uncertain tax positions  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof 
other additionally  significant estimates have been made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements including allowances for doubtful accounts  accruals related to self insurance programs  certain legal proceedings  estimated losses from disposals of discontinued operations  and certain assumptions related to determining stock based compensation

provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was in  in  and in the tax rate for reflects the fact that a significant portion of the impairment charges taken in was not deductible for income tax purposes 
income taxes are provided based upon our anticipated underlying annual blended federal and state income tax rates  adjusted  as necessary  for any other tax matters occurring during the period 
as we operate in various states  our effective tax rate is also dependent upon our geographic revenue mix 
we expect our underlying tax rate to be approximately on an ongoing basis  excluding the impact of any potential tax adjustments in the future 
as of december   we had unrecognized tax benefits recorded in accordance with fin see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
our unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by approximately million net of tax effect as a result of the expiration of a statute of limitations in october we do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease during the twelve months beginning january  during  we recorded net income tax benefits in our provision for income taxes of million related to the resolution of certain tax matters  changes in certain state tax laws  and other adjustments

certain amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended december    and  have been adjusted to classify the results of these stores as discontinued operations

for information regarding compliance with our covenants  refer to the discussion under the heading restrictions and covenants below 
at december   we had million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
in the ordinary course of business  we are required to post performance and surety bonds  letters of credit  and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance 
at december   surety bonds  letters of credit  and cash deposits totaled million  including million in letters of credit 
we do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit 
see the table at the beginning of note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the amounts of our notes payable and long term debt as of december  and senior unsecured notes and amended credit agreement in april  we sold million of floating rate senior unsecured notes due april   and million of senior unsecured notes due april   in each case at par 
the floating rate senior unsecured notes bear interest at a rate equal to three month libor plus per annum  adjusted quarterly  and may be redeemed by us currently at of principal  on or after april   at of principal  on or after april   at of principal  and on or after april   at of principal 
the senior unsecured notes may be redeemed by us on or after april   at of principal  on or after april   at of principal  on or after april   at of principal  and on or after april   at of principal 
in april  we also completed the first amendment to our credit agreement to provide a million revolving credit facility that provided for various interest rates on borrowings generally at libor plus  and a million term loan facility bearing interest at a rate equal to libor plus 
in december  the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility was increased to million under the amended credit agreement 
the proceeds of the senior unsecured notes and term loan facility  together with cash on hand and borrowings of million under the amended revolving credit facility  were used to purchase million shares of our common stock at per share for an aggregate purchase price of billion pursuant to our equity tender offer  purchase million aggregate principal of our senior unsecured notes for an aggregate total consideration of million pursuant to our debt tender offer and consent solicitation  and pay related financing costs 
approximately million of tender premium and other financing costs related to our debt tender offer was expensed during in july  we completed a second amendment of the credit agreement 
under the terms of the second amendment  the interest rate on the term loan facility decreased from libor plus to libor plus and the interest rate on the revolving credit facility decreased from libor plus to libor plus 
additionally  the credit agreement termination date was extended from july   to july   and certain other terms and conditions were modified as a result of this amendment 
we incurred million of expenses in connection with this modification during  which are included as a component of other interest expense in the accompanying consolidated income statements 
we have a letter of credit sublimit as part of our revolving credit facility 
the amount available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit  which was million at december  we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december   leaving million of borrowing capacity at december  as of december   this borrowing capacity was limited under the maximum consolidated leverage ratio contained in our amended credit agreement to approximately million 
during  we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior unsecured notes due april   for an aggregate total consideration of million 
we also repurchased million aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured notes due april   for an aggregate total consideration of million 
we recorded a gain of million in connection with these repurchases  net of the write off of related unamortized debt issuance costs

we also committed to repurchase an additional million aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured notes for which settlement occurred subsequent to december  we have reclassified these amounts from long term to current debt as of december  we will record a gain in the first quarter of of million on the repurchase of these notes  net of the write off of related unamortized debt issuance costs 
the credit spread charged for the revolving credit facility and term loan facility is impacted by our senior unsecured credit ratings from standard poor s bb  with negative outlook and moody s ba  with negative outlook 
for instance  under the current terms of our amended credit agreement  a one notch downgrade of our senior unsecured credit rating by either standard poor s or moody s would result in a basis point increase in the credit spread under our term loan facility  a basis point increase in the credit spread under our revolving credit facility  and a basis point increase in the facility fee applicable to our revolving credit facility 
credit ratings could be lowered if new vehicle demand worsens significantly  threatening our earnings and cash flow  or if we increase our financial leverage through acquisitions or share repurchases 
the outlook could be revised back to stable if market demand returns in the near term or if we demonstrate our ability to maintain reasonable profitability  cash flow  and leverage measures despite the ongoing revenue pressures 
we may from time to time repurchase additional senior unsecured notes in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions 
additionally  we may in the future prepay our term loan facility or other debt 
the decision to repurchase senior unsecured notes or to prepay our term loan facility or other debt will be based on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions  and other factors 
other debt on august   we repaid million of senior unsecured notes that matured on that date 
at december   we had million outstanding under a mortgage facility with an automotive manufacturer s captive finance subsidiary 
the mortgage facility was refinanced under a new facility in november to provide a fixed interest rate and provide financing secured by year mortgages on certain of our store properties 
in connection with this refinancing  in we received net proceeds of approximately million and recorded million of expenses  which are included as a component of other interest expense in the accompanying consolidated income statements 
prior to this refinancing  the facility utilized short term libor based interest rates  which averaged for vehicle floorplan payable trade totaled billion at december   and billion at december  vehicle floorplan payable trade reflects amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific vehicle inventories with manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries 
vehicle floorplan payable non trade totaled million at december   and million at december   and represents amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new and  to a lesser extent  used vehicle inventories with non trade lenders 
all the floorplan facilities are at one month libor based rates of interest 
floorplan facilities are due on demand  but in the case of new vehicle inventories  are generally paid within several business days after the related vehicles are sold 
our manufacturer agreements generally require that the manufacturer have the ability to draft against the new floorplan facilities so the lender directly funds the manufacturer for the purchase of new vehicle inventory 
floorplan facilities are primarily collateralized by vehicle inventories and related receivables 
share repurchases and dividends the following table sets forth information regarding our share repurchases over the past three years year ended december shares repurchased aggregate purchase price as of december   million remained available for share repurchases under the existing repurchase program approved by our board of directors 
future share repurchases are subject to limitations contained in the indenture relating to our floating rate and senior unsecured notes 
the decision to repurchase shares in the future will be based on such factors as the market price of our common stock versus our view of its intrinsic value  the potential impact on our capital structure including compliance with the financial ratios in our debt agreements  and the expected return on competing uses of capital such as dealership acquisitions  capital investments in our current businesses  or repurchases of our debt 
in  in light of the economic conditions  our liquidity and capital resource strategies were focused on generating cash and paying down debt to remain in compliance with the financial covenants in our debt agreements 
we expect that in we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash to pay down debt 
see also restrictions and covenants below 
we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during our two most recent fiscal years 
we do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
the indenture for our floating rate and senior unsecured notes restricts our ability to declare cash dividends 
see restrictions and covenants below 
restrictions and covenants our amended credit agreement  the indenture for our floating rate and senior unsecured notes  our vehicle floorplan payable facilities  and our mortgage facility contain numerous customary financial and operating covenants that place significant restrictions on us  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness  to declare cash dividends  to create liens or other encumbrances  to sell or otherwise dispose of assets  and to merge or consolidate with other entities 
for example  under the amended credit agreement  we are required to remain in compliance with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio  as defined times through september   after which it will revert to times 
in march  we amended our credit agreement to provide that non cash impairment losses associated with goodwill and intangible assets as well as certain other non cash charges would be excluded from the computation of the maximum consolidated leverage ratio 
we are also required to remain in compliance with a maximum capitalization ratio  as defined 
in addition  the indenture for the floating rate and senior unsecured notes contains a debt incurrence restriction based on a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  and the mortgage facility contains covenants regarding maximum cash flow leverage and minimum interest coverage 
the indenture for our floating rate and senior unsecured notes restricts our ability to make payments in connection with share repurchases  dividends  debt retirement  investments  and similar matters to a cumulative aggregate amount that is limited to million plus of our cumulative consolidated net income as defined in the indenture since april   the net proceeds of stock option exercises  and certain other items  subject to certain exceptions and conditions set forth in the indenture 
our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt agreements could permit acceleration of all of our indebtedness 
our debt agreements have cross default provisions that trigger a default in the event of an uncured default under other material indebtedness of autonation 
during  we recorded impairment charges of billion billion after tax associated with goodwill and franchise rights 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
despite these impairment charges  as of december   we were in compliance with the requirements of all applicable financial covenants under our debt agreements 
as of december   under our amended credit agreement  our consolidated leverage ratio was approximately to  as defined in our credit agreement 
our capitalization ratio was adversely impacted by the impairment charges  and as of december   this ratio was approximately  as defined in our credit agreement 
both the consolidated leverage ratio and the capitalization ratio limit our ability to incur additional non vehicle debt 
the capitalization ratio also limits our ability to incur additional floorplan indebtedness 
our liquidity and capital resource strategies are currently focused on generating cash and paying down debt to remain in compliance with the financial covenants in our debt agreements 
to the extent that in the future we believe that we will be unable to comply with the covenants in our amended credit agreement  we will seek an amendment or waiver of our amended credit agreement  which could increase the cost of our debt 
we may also consider other options  such as raising capital through an equity issuance to pay down debt  which could be dilutive to stockholders 
see the risk factor our revolving credit facility  term loan facility  mortgage facility  and the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes contain certain financial ratios and other restrictions on our ability to conduct our business in part i  item a  of this form k 
in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings  none of the covenants described above would be impacted 
in addition  availability under the amended credit agreement described above would not be impacted should a downgrade in the senior unsecured debt credit ratings occur 
certain covenants in the indenture for the floating rate and senior unsecured notes would be eliminated with an upgrade of our senior unsecured notes to investment grade by either standard poor s or moody s

off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
seasonality our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models 
also  demand for vehicles and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons  particularly in regions of the united states where stores may be subject to adverse winter conditions 
accordingly  we expect our revenue and operating results generally to be lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters
