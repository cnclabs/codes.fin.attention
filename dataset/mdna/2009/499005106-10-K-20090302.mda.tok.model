assets under management were billion as of december   down from billion of assets under management as of december  due to unprecedented market conditions  pending redemptions and industry wide changes in margin and finance requirements  and after evaluation of a number of strategic options  the company concluded that it was in the best interests of investors in the deephaven funds and the company s shareholders to exit our asset management segment

asset management our pre tax results after minority interest expense from asset management decreased in by million from the results in the decrease is primarily due to lower incentive allocation fees as a result of significantly lower fund returns and lower management fees as a result of a decrease in assets under management  offset in part by a decrease in profitability based bonuses 
asset management revenues in were also adversely impacted by the announced closing of the event fund  as described further under the headings deephaven and subsequent events in this md a 

table of contents corporate our pre tax results from our corporate segment in decreased by million from  primarily due to losses on our corporate investment as a limited partner or non managing member in the deephaven funds offset  in part by an increase of million in pre tax gains in other income from the additional partial sale of our equity interest in direct edge during certain factors affecting results of operations we may experience significant variation in our future results of operations 
these fluctuations may result from numerous factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include  among other things  introductions of or enhancements to trade execution services by us or our competitors  the value of our securities positions and other instruments and our ability to manage the risks attendant thereto  the volume of our trade execution activities  the dollar value of securities traded  the composition of our order flow  volatility in the securities markets  our market share with institutional and broker dealer clients  the performance and size of  and volatility in  our quantitative market making and program trading portfolios  the performance of our high velocity algorithmic trading models  the performance of our international operations and cost associated with our international expansion  our ability to manage personnel  overhead and other expenses  including our occupancy expenses under our office leases and expenses and charges relating to legal and regulatory proceedings  the strength of our client relationships  changes in payments for order flow and clearing  execution and regulatory transaction costs  the level of assets under management and fund returns  performance of the asset management investment strategies  the addition or loss of executive management  sales  electronic and voice trading  technology and asset management professionals  legislative  legal and regulatory changes  legal and regulatory matters  geopolitical risk  the amount and timing of capital expenditures  acquisitions and divestitures  the integration  performance and operation of acquired businesses  the incurrence of costs associated with acquisitions and dispositions  investor sentiment  technological changes and events  seasonality  competition  and market and economic conditions 
such factors may also have an impact on our ability to achieve our strategic objectives  including  without limitation  increases in our market share  growth and profitability in our global markets segment 
if demand for our services declines due to any of the above factors  and we are unable to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of the foregoing factors  period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
there also can be no assurance that we will be able to continue the rates of revenue growth that we have experienced in the past or that we will be able to improve our operating results 
trends global economic trends our businesses are affected by many factors in the global financial markets and worldwide economic conditions 
these factors include the growth level of gross domestic product in the us  europe and asia  and the existence of transparent  efficient and liquid equity markets and level of trading volumes 
economic growth continued to slow during  with weakness becoming more broadly based across global economies in the second half of the us economy entered a recession in the beginning of which intensified as the year progressed 
much of the slowdown was attributable to weakness in credit markets brought on by contraction in the housing market and the associated increase in mortgage defaults 
liquidity and credit concerns were further exacerbated with the 
table of contents changing landscape of the us financial services industry 
global financial markets continued to experience substantially increased levels of volatility due to concerns about the outlook for global growth  inflation  declining asset values  and credit markets continued to experience illiquidity and wider credit spreads 
trends affecting our company we believe that our businesses are affected by the aforementioned global economic trends as well as more specific trends 
some of the specific trends that impact our operations  financial condition and results of operations are broker dealer clients continue to focus on statistics measuring the quality of equity executions including speed of execution and price improvement 
in an effort to improve the quality of their executions as well as increase efficiencies  market makers have increased the level of automation within their operations 
over the past several years  the greater focus on execution quality has resulted in greater competition in the marketplace  which  along with market structure changes and market conditions  has negatively impacted the revenue capture metrics of the company and other market making firms 
equity transaction volumes executed by broker dealers have fluctuated over the past few years due to retail investor sentiment  market conditions and a variety of other factors  resulting in a shift of product mix 
equity transaction volumes may not be sustainable and are not predictable 
there has been consolidation among market centers over the past several years  and several regional exchanges have entered into joint ventures with broker dealers to create their own alternative trading systems ie  ecns and compete within the otc and listed trading venues 
in addition  there are many new entrants into the market  including alternative trading systems atss and dark liquidity pools 
further  many broker dealers are offering their own internal crossing networks 
these factors continue to create further fragmentation in the marketplace 
market structure changes  competition and market conditions have triggered an industry shift toward market makers charging explicit commissions or commission equivalents to institutional clients for executions in otc securities 
for the majority of our institutional client orders  we charge explicit fees in the form of commissions or commission equivalents 
institutional commission rates have fallen in the past few years due to competitive forces and increased electronic trading  and may continue to fall in the future 
market structure changes  competition and technology advancements have also led to a dramatic increase in electronic message traffic 
these increases in message traffic place heavy strains on the technology resources  bandwidth and capacities of market participants 
due to regulatory scrutiny over the past several years relating to equity sell side research and the continued focus by investors on execution quality and overall transaction costs  more institutional clients allocate commissions to broker dealers based on the quality of executions 
in the past  a significant portion of institutional equity commissions were allocated to broker dealers in exchange for either research or soft dollar and commission recapture programs 
there has been continued scrutiny of market makers  specialists and hedge funds by the regulatory and legislative authorities 
new legislation or modifications to existing regulations and rules could occur in the future and could materially impact the company s revenues and profitability 
for example  in november  finra enacted rules regarding the otc bulletin board markets which required that all non nasdaq securities be subject to limit order protection 
also  further amendments to regulation sho and related short sale rules  could make it much more difficult for market makers to sell securities short 

table of contents there continues to be growth in electronic equity trading  as evidenced by increased volumes in direct market access platforms  algorithmic and program trading  and ecns and dark liquidity pools 
in addition  electronic trading continues to expand to other asset classes  including options  currencies and fixed income 
the expansion of electronic trading may result in the growth of innovative electronic products and competition for order flow 
the macro economic environment and market conditions have had an adverse impact on the profitability of alternative asset management business  such as deephaven  resulting in volatile earnings and increased investor redemptions across the industry 
income statement items the following section briefly describes the key components of  and drivers to  our significant revenues and expenses
