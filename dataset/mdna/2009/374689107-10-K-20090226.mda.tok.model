overview we are a leading manufacturer  processor and distributor of residential and commercial building products and processed metal products for the building and construction  industrial  and automotive markets 
our building products are used by homeowners and builders to provide structural and architectural enhancements for residential and commercial building projects 
our processed metal products are comprised primarily of steel shaped to specific widths and hardened to certain tolerances as required by our customers 
we serve customers in a variety of industries in all states and throughout the world 
we operate facilities in states  canada  england  germany  and poland  giving us a broad platform for just in time delivery and support to our customers beginning in and continuing throughout with greater deceleration in the fourth quarter of  the residential construction and automotive markets in north america experienced the following declines in volume for years ended december  residential housing starts million million million north american auto builds million million million the decrease in residential housing starts and north american auto builds had a significant impact on the operations of our building products and processed metal products segments  respectively  by contributing to decreased sales volumes in each segment 
in an effort to respond to these market forces during the past two years  we have focused on operational excellence through lean manufacturing initiatives and facility consolidations 
our efforts have resulted in the closing or consolidation of fifteen facilities and ten facilities during and  respectively 
these facility consolidations include the relocation of the manufacturing capabilities of six plants to the company s other manufacturing facilities during two plants were shut down during and their manufacturing capabilities were moved to other facilities 
our efforts to consolidate facilities and streamline operations to match the current demand for our products have resulted in a decrease in our workforce from approximately  employees as of december  to  employees as of december  we have focused on controlling our spending in an effort to remain as a low cost supplier to our customers 
many of our lean manufacturing initiatives have focused on reducing the working capital required to manage our business 
during  our achievements in this effort have resulted in an million reduction in working capital from million as of december  to million as of december  this reduction in working capital plus other cash flows generated from operating and investing activities has allowed us to reduce our total debt outstanding by million 
these lean manufacturing initiatives and facility consolidations plus other actions led to significant improvement in the first nine months of prior to when the banking and credit markets sharply deteriorated in october the steps management took during the past two years led to much improved 
table of contents operating results during the first nine months of the year as evidenced below amounts below were restated to reflect the results of scm in discontinued operations and are in thousands except for per share data nine months ended september  september  percentage change net sales gross profit income from operations income from continuing operations diluted income per share from continuing operations our net sales and profits increased during due to the incremental contributions provided by the acquisitions of dramex  noll and florence and better pricing on sales within our processed metal products segment partially offset by declining volumes from our residential building products and automotive products due to the downturn in demand in these markets 
we increased our profitability by better aligning our customer selling prices to our product costs and decreased spending through facility consolidation efforts and lean manufacturing initiatives 
however  the improved operating results did not carry over into the fourth quarter of the worldwide banking and credit turmoil in the fourth quarter of significantly contributed to a dramatic downturn of the global economy and the key end markets we serve 
these factors led to a significant decrease in the company s sales volume and profitability as evidenced below amounts in thousands except for per share data three months ended december  december  percentage change net sales gross profit income from operations income from continuing operations diluted income per share from continuing operations the decrease in net sales was a result of significant turmoil within the global economy and its negative impact on the new build housing and the north american auto markets 
as a result of the lower sales volume experienced by the company  gross profit as a percentage of sales declined to from for the fourth quarters of and  respectively  due to fixed cost becoming a higher percentage of net sales and the fifo first in  first out inventory valuation method effect on margins in some product lines as material costs and product pricing declined as a result of commodity raw material pricing declines 
our processed metal products segment also recognized a million charge to bad debt expense during the fourth quarter of due to an automotive customer filing for bankruptcy 
outlook as in the fourth quarter of  there is little forward visibility on either the economy or our industry  therefore  we are not providing numerical guidance for we see the first quarter as again being very challenging  with only marginally better results than the fourth quarter of and we are expecting an operating loss in the first quarter as results continue to reflect the extremely difficult global economic environment 
in the meantime  we continue aggressive efforts to increase liquidity and reduce costs and will take additional actions as market conditions warrant 
we believe that the aggressive actions taken during the past two years to streamline and improve the efficiency of our business will position our company to generate marked improvements in performance when economic and end market conditions return to more normal levels

in december  we recognized an impairment of our investment in our gibraltar dfc strip steel  llc joint venture 
we determined that our investment in this joint venture was other than temporarily impaired and recognized a million charge related to the joint venture at the end of this impairment was the primary reason for the significant loss recorded in the equity in partnerships income loss during in  we recognized a income from our equity in partnerships income loss as we no longer incurred losses from the joint venture noted above 
income taxes related to continuing operations for approximated million based upon an effective tax rate of compared to in the increase in the effective tax rate during was the result of a higher proportion of permanently non deductible expenses as a percentage of pre tax income 
we experienced a loss from discontinued operations of million in compared to income from discontinued operations of million in the loss in was primarily a result of losses recognized for the liquidation of our steel service center and bath cabinet manufacturing businesses 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had total liquidity of million consisting of million of cash and cash equivalents and million of availability under our million revolving credit facility 
our liquidity increased million from million as of december  mainly due to increased availability under our revolving credit facility 
the restrictive covenants in our second amended and restated credit agreement dated august  the senior credit agreement  which includes our million revolving credit facility and our million term loan facility  require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests 
our total leverage ratio as defined in the senior credit agreement approximated to as of december  the senior credit agreement does not at any time permit our total leverage ratio to exceed to 
our interest coverage ratio as of december  approximated to 
the senior credit agreement requires our interest coverage as defined with the agreement to exceed to 
we also had net worth at december  that exceeded million plus of cumulative net income in each fiscal quarter beginning with the quarter ended september  as required per the senior credit agreement 
as of december   we could have borrowed approximately million more under our revolving credit facility without violating our total leverage ratio covenant or any other financial covenant 
the total leverage ratio will increase during periods where earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda as defined in the senior credit agreement declines compared to the comparable prior year period 
we experienced a larger loss from operations during the fourth quarter of compared to the 
table of contents fourth quarter of  which resulted in less ebitda being generated in the fourth quarter of we are expecting ebitda generated during the first quarter of to be lower than the first quarter of therefore  permitted borrowings allowed under the financial covenants included in the senior credit agreement could be less than actual borrowings at quarter ends during if this happens  we would be in breach of one of our restrictive debt covenants 
a breach of any of the covenants would result in a default under the senior credit agreement 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior credit agreement  we would attempt to receive a waiver from our lenders  which could result in us incurring additional financing costs consisting of upfront fees to our syndicate of lenders and increased interest rates used to determine interest due on amounts outstanding under the senior credit agreement 
we are monitoring our compliance with our restrictive covenants closely and currently expect to remain in compliance throughout a detailed description of our risks of default is included in the risk factors included in item a of this annual report on form k 
the world wide economic downturn during the second half of has had a significant impact on the liquidity in the financial markets 
we continue to monitor the counter party risk of all of our creditors and focus on maintaining adequate liquity to fund our principal capital requirements 
one of the banks in our syndicate was acquired by another bank in our syndicate in december we continue to monitor the financial condition of the members in our syndicate  and based on the monitoring  believe that our current banking relationships will continue to provide the liquidity needed to support our principal capital requirements throughout throughout  we focused on increasing positive cash flow  working capital management and debt reduction 
we see the first quarter of as being a very challenging period for our company given the uncertainty in the general economy and the related effects on the residential construction and north american automotive markets 
accordingly  we will focus on liquidity preservation to meet our principal capital requirements during as a result  gibraltar s board of directors has decided to suspend quarterly dividends with the expectation of reinstating payments when economic conditions and our profitability improve 
we believe that availability of funds under our existing senior credit agreement together with the cash generated from operations will be sufficient to provide the company with the liquidity and capital resources necessary to support our principal capital requirements 
our principal capital requirements are to fund our operations  including working capital  the purchase and funding of improvements to our facilities  machinery and equipment and to fund acquisitions 
despite the continuing downturn in the credit and equity markets  we believe that our liquidity will be adequate to satisfy our obligations throughout we expect that future obligations  including the funding of future acquisitions and capital expenditures  may be financed through a number of sources  including internally available cash resources  new debt financing  the issuance of equity securities or any combination of the above 
this opinion is a forward looking statement based upon currently available information and may change if conditions in the credit and equity markets further deteriorate 
to the extent that operating cash flows are lower than current levels or sources of financing are not available or available at acceptable terms  future liquidity may be adversely affected 
we regularly consider various strategic business opportunities including acquisitions 
we evaluate such potential acquisitions on the basis of our ability to enhance our existing products  operations  or capabilities  as well as provide access to new products  markets and customers 
although no assurances can be given that any acquisition will be consummated  we may finance such acquisitions through a number of sources including internally available cash resources  new debt financing  the issuance of equity securities or any combination of the above if they are available at acceptable terms

the notes are guaranteed by each of our material domestic subsidiaries 
the senior credit agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants customary for similar working capital facilities  including  but not limited to  several financial covenants 
we must maintain a total funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda as defined in the credit agreement ratio total leverage ratio not to exceed to 
we must also maintain a senior funded debt to consolidated ebitda ratio not to exceed to 
our interest coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense  must not be less than to and our net worth must be at least million plus of cumulative net income in each fiscal quarter beginning with the quarter ended september  the notes agreement for our senior subordinated notes also contains provisions that limit additional borrowings and require minimum net worth and financial ratios 
at december   the company was in compliance with the terms and provisions of all its financing agreements 
we will continue to monitor our compliance with our restrictive covenants closely as reductions in ebitda generated during the fourth quarter of and potentially throughout could lead to tightness within our total leverage ratio debt covenant at quarters ended during we currently expect to remain in compliance with our restrictive covenants throughout off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements

we have not included the liabilities for uncertain tax positions as we cannot make reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors it considers relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which could differ from those anticipated 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
our most critical accounting policies include valuation of accounts receivable  which impacts selling  general and administrative expense  valuation of inventory  which impacts cost of sales and gross margin  the allocation of the purchase price of our acquisition related assets and liabilities  which affects our depreciation and amortization costs  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible and long lived assets  which impacts write offs of goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets  and accounting for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities  which impacts the provision for income taxes 

table of contents management reviews the estimates  including the allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory reserves on a regular basis and makes adjustments based on historical experience  current conditions and future expectations 
management believes these estimates are reasonable  but actual results could differ from these estimates 
valuation of accounts receivable 
our accounts receivable represent those amounts that have been billed to our customers but not yet collected 
as of december  and  allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  or and of gross accounts receivable  were recorded  respectively 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the portion of those accounts receivable that we believe are potentially uncollectible based on various factors  including historical experience  creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing of costs recognized 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  increased from the prior year primarily due to a million charge to bad debts recorded in the fourth quarter of relating to an automotive customer filing for bankruptcy 
valuation of inventories 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we determine the cost basis of our inventory on a first in first out basis using either actual costs or a standard cost methodology that approximates actual cost 
on a regular basis  we calculate an estimated market value of our inventory  considered to be the prevailing selling price for the inventory less the cost to complete and sell the product 
we compare the current carrying value of our inventory to the estimated market value to determine whether a reserve to value inventory at the lower of cost or market is necessary 
as of december  and  no reserve to value our inventory to the lower of cost or market was considered necessary 
we regularly review inventory on hand and record provisions for excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends 
we recorded reserves for excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory of million and million  or and of gross inventories  as of december  and  respectively 
changes in product demand and our customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand  which may require higher provisions for obsolete inventory 
allocation to purchase price of acquired assets and liabilities 
when we acquire a new business  we must allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the transaction at their respective estimated fair market values 
we record any premium over the fair market value of the net assets acquired as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price involves judgments and estimates both in characterizing the assets and in determining their fair market value 
the way we characterize the assets has important implications  as long lived assets with definitive lives  for example  are depreciated or amortized  whereas goodwill is tested annually for impairment  as explained below 
with respect to determining the fair market value of assets  the most difficult estimations of individual fair market values are those involving long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and identified intangible assets 
we use all available information to make these fair market value determinations and engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in the fair market value determination of the acquired long lived assets 
the following summarizes the amount of purchase price allocated to property  plant and equipment  identified intangible assets and goodwill for the acquisitions we completed in in millions initial property  identified purchase plant and intangible other net acquisition price equipment assets goodwill assets dramex corporation noll manufacturing company and affiliates florence corporation due to the subjectivity inherent in determining the estimated fair market value of long lived assets and the significant number of business acquisitions that we have completed  we believe that the recording of acquired assets and liabilities is a critical accounting policy 

table of contents impairment of depreciable and amortizable long lived assets 
we test long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceeds their fair market value 
the following summarizes the value of long lived assets subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances indicate potential impairment as of december  in millions balance as of december  property  plant and equipment  net acquired intangibles with estimable useful lives other assets impairment exists if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
the impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair market value as determined by discounted cash flow method or in the case of negative cash flow  an independent market appraisal of the asset 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing 
our goodwill balance  million as of december   is subject to impairment testing 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually  as of october  and more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicate there may be an impairment 
these events or circumstances could include a significant long term adverse change in the business climate  poor indicators of operating performance  or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
during  we tested goodwill for impairment as of december as a result of the economic downturn and the decrease in our stock price in the fourth quarter  as well as our annual assessment date of october we test goodwill at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our operating segments 
we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
we currently have reporting units as compared to reporting units for the goodwill impairment test 
the sale of scm resulted in the divestiture of two reporting units and our acquisition of florence resulted in the addition of a reporting unit 
we aggregated the acquisitions of dramex and noll into other reporting units with similar economic characteristics 
the goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit  determined using discounted cash flows  with its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
testing goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and judgmental factors 
the key estimates and factors used in our discounted cash flow valuation include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts  terminal value  and the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows 
revenue growth forecasted for ranged from a increase to a decline compared to the reporting units revenue amounts with increases in revenues beginning in for all but one reporting unit 
the compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of our projections ranged between and  with the higher growth rates in those businesses that have experienced sharp declines due to the downturn in the residential housing market 
the terminal value was calculated assuming projected growth rates of after five years which reflects our estimate of long term gross domestic product growth 
operating profit margins were projected to return to historical norms by in the individual reporting units as we expect the residential housing industry to recover over the next few years 
the estimated weighted average cost of capital was determined to be based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix and related volatility and the size of their market capitalization 
future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our goodwill impairment tests 
for example  a decline in the terminal growth rate greater than 
table of contents basis points or an increase in the weighted average cost of capital greater than basis points would have indicated impairment in one reporting unit as of october  whose goodwill was million 
the testing performed as of october  and december  indicated an excess of estimated fair market value over book value for each reporting unit 
however  if the projected long term revenue growth rates  profit margins  or terminal rates are considerably lower  and or the estimated weighted average cost of capital is considerably higher  future testing may indicate an impairment of one or more of the company s reporting units and  as a result  the related goodwill would likely be impaired 
we also test our indefinite lived intangible assets  which totaled million as of december   for impairment on an annual basis as of october  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset could be below its carrying amount 
the impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset  determined using discounted cash flows  with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value 
accounting for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate due to the impact of permanent differences between financial statement and tax income  provisions for uncertain tax positions  state taxes and income generated by international operations 
our effective tax rate was   and  for   and  respectively 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and vice versa 
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof may also adversely affect our future effective tax rate 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
in  deferred income tax liabilities increased primarily due to amortization recorded for tax purposes relating to goodwill 
deferred income tax assets increased primarily due to an increase in equity compensation 
regarding deferred income tax assets  we maintained valuation allowances of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets  primarily consisting of capital losses and state net operating losses 
the valuation allowances are based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if market conditions improve and future results of operations exceed our current expectations  our existing tax valuation allowances may be adjusted  resulting in future tax benefits 
alternatively  if market conditions deteriorate further or future results of operations are less than expected  future assessments may result in a determination that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not realizable 
as a result  we may need to establish additional tax valuation allowances for all or a portion of the gross deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which we adopted january  fin addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  the company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
the result of the company s reassessment of its tax positions in accordance with fin resulted in a  increase in tax liabilities  with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings 
the recognition was caused by uncertain tax positions of  and the provision for related interest and penalties of  it is the company s policy to record estimated interest and penalties as income tax expense and tax credits as a reduction in income tax expense 
the company recognizes both interest and penalties as part of 
table of contents the income tax provision 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized  and  of interest net of federal tax benefit and penalties  respectively 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
valuation allowances are provided if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december  and  the liability for uncertain income tax positions was  and  respectively 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring 
table of contents fair value  and expands the related disclosure requirements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
this statement indicates  among other things  that a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or  in the absence of a principal market  the most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
sfas no 
defines fair value based upon an exit price model 
relative to sfas no 
 the fasb issued fasb staff positions fsp  and fsp amends sfas no 
to exclude sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions  while fsp delayed the effective date of the application of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after november  for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
fsp addresses considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
we adopted sfas no 
as of january   with the exception of the application of the statement to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities 
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities for which we have not applied the provisions of sfas no 
include those measured at fair value in goodwill impairment testing  indefinite lived intangible assets measured at fair value for impairment testing and those initially measured at fair value in a business combination 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
was not significant to our financial statements 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
for nonfinancial assets and liabilities in has been determined 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which allows measurement of specified financial instruments  warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in each period 
sfas no 
is effective at the beginning of the fiscal year that begins after november  as of january   we did not elect to value any specified financial instruments or warranty or insurance contracts at fair value 
therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our consolidated financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which requires most identifiable assets  liabilities  non controlling interests and goodwill acquired in business combinations to be recorded at full fair value 
sfas no 
r also requires that the direct costs of acquisitions be expensed as incurred and that the estimated fair value of contingent consideration be recorded at the date of purchase  with changes in the estimated fair value recorded in the income statement 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and will be effective for the company in this standard may be adopted only on a prospective basis and may have a material impact upon our results of operations if we complete significant acquisitions in the future 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 

the objective of sfas no 
is to improve the relevance  comparability and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing additional accounting and reporting standards 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  early adoption of this standard is prohibited 
we do not expect that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  and will be effective for the company in the standard requires comparative disclosures only for periods subsequent to initial adoption 
the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
is not anticipated to significantly impact the company s disclosures 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to various market risk factors  including changes in general economic conditions  competition and raw materials pricing and availability 
in addition  the company is exposed to market risk  primarily related to its long term debt 
to manage interest rate risk  the company uses both fixed and variable interest rate debt 
the company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement that converted a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
at december   the company had million of term loan borrowings that are effectively converted to fixed rate debt pursuant to the interest rate swap agreement 
in  we de designated million of term loan borrowings as being hedged under our interest rate swap agreement due to a payment made to reduce the amount of debt outstanding under our term loan 
changes in the fair value of the related unhedged portion of the interest rate swap are recorded as gains and losses through our consolidated income statement as opposed to accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
the following table summarizes the principal cash flows and related interest rates of the company s long term debt at december  by expected maturity dates 
the weighted average interest rates are based on the actual rates that existed at december  the variable rate debt consists primarily of the revolving credit facility and term loan  of which million is outstanding at december  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would have changed the interest expense by approximately million 
thereafter total in thousands long term debt fixed weighted average interest rate long term debt variable weighted average interest rate interest rate swap notional amount interest pay rate interest receive rate the fair value of the company s long term debt was million at december  represents the notional amount on which interest payments and receipts are determined under the interest rate swap  there is no exchange of principal under the interest rate swap agreement
