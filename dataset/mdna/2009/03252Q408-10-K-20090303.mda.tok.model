item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k 
part i item business overview anadys pharmaceuticals  inc is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving patient care by developing novel medicines in the areas of hepatitis c and oncology 
we are developing ana  a small molecule  non nucleoside inhibitor of the nsb polymerase for the treatment of hepatitis c and ana  an oral  small molecule toll like receptor tlr agonist prodrug for the treatment of hepatitis c and cancer 
both ana and ana were discovered at anadys and are wholly owned assets of anadys 
we believe that hepatitis c and oncology are two disease areas that represent large and significant unmet medical needs 
our objective is to develop new medicines that will improve the treatment outcomes for patients with these serious diseases 
we believe that meaningful improvements in patient outcomes offer the highest likelihood for commercial acceptance of our products if approved for sale 
our expertise is based on two distinct scientific approaches to treating disease 
with ana we are focused on developing a direct antiviral  meaning a product candidate that acts by directly interacting with  and blocking the function of  a component of the virus 
we discovered ana through an extensive structure based drug design program that focused on parameters critical for success in chronic viral diseases  including potency and sustained drug levels in blood 
with ana  we are stimulating the patient s own immune system to block cells infected with the hepatitis c virus from further amplifying the infection by producing more virus particles 
activation of the same pathways may also allow the patient s immune system to attack cancer cells 
ana stimulates the immune system through activating a key receptor on immune cells known as tlr our knowledge of tlr is buttressed by an extensive preclinical program exploring the pharmacology of this receptor and by previous clinical experience with other molecules that act by the tlr mechanism 
ana ana is a direct antiviral that blocks the hepatitis c virus hcv ability to multiply by inhibiting the viral rna polymerase 
ana belongs to a class of direct antivirals referred to as non nucleosides 
we believe non nucleosides will become an important component of future combination regimens used to treat hcv infection  similar to the role played by non nucleoside inhibitors in hiv therapy 
in we selected ana as a development candidate 
this selection represented the culmination of a comprehensive structure based drug design program directed towards the viral rna polymerase 
ana has demonstrated the preclinical properties  including potency  pharmacokinetics and early safety  that we believe are prerequisites for successful development in the hcv area 
ana is currently being investigated in a phase ib patient study 
on january  we announced results from the first cohort of this study which demonstrated a log median viral load decline after three days of dosing in the eight patients who received mg of ana twice daily 
this data was subsequently supplemented with data from three additional patients who also received mg of ana twice daily over three days 
results from all eleven patients who received the mg dose level demonstrated a log median viral load decline 
results from these eleven patients also indicated that ana was very well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported  although conclusions regarding longer term safety and tolerability cannot be 
table of contents made until the results of future clinical trials of longer duration in more patients are known 
following our announcement of the data from the patients who received the mg dose level  we continued to enroll the subsequent dose cohorts  dosing patients with either placebo  or mg or mg twice daily over three days 
we are nearing completion of dosing in the phase ib study and expect to receive and analyze the safety and viral load data from the mg and mg dose cohorts over the course of the next several weeks 
we intend to release the full data from all three dose cohorts during the second quarter of we are also currently conducting a clinical trial of ana in healthy subjects to evaluate the steady state pharmacokinetics  safety and tolerability of multiple doses of ana administered orally over a day period 
we expect to have data from this study in the second quarter of preclinical evaluation of ana required for initiation of clinical investigation was completed in the first quarter of  leading to submission of an investigational new drug application ind to the us food and drug administration fda  subsequent allowance of the ind by the fda and initiation of clinical investigation in the second quarter of in december  we announced that the fda granted fast track designation to ana for the treatment of chronic hcv infection 
in the preclinical program  ana was well tolerated at all doses tested in day glp toxicology studies 
in september  we initiated long term  chronic toxicology studies of ana contingent on successful completion  these long term toxicology studies are designed to support dosing up to weeks in phase ii studies 
if ana is successful in early stage development  we anticipate completing in mid the clinical  toxicology and manufacturing activities that should enable us to be ready to initiate longer term  phase ii  studies of ana in combination with current standard of care 
the actual timing for the initiation of phase ii studies will depend on a number of factors  including fda review timelines  the timing of any potential strategic alliance or other transaction around ana or ana  available cash resources and funding activities and the engagement of clinical sites 
ana ana is a novel  oral inducer of endogenous interferons that acts via the tlr pathway that we are developing as a treatment for both hcv and cancer 
both the prodrug and its active substance were discovered  designed and synthesized by anadys scientists 
pharmacology studies have shown that ana can elicit desired immune responses and that components of the response can be modulated by both dose and schedule of administration 
ana for hcv in july  we resumed investigation of the tlr mechanism for hcv by taking ana into a clinical trial in the netherlands that was designed to test ana in both healthy volunteers and patients with hcv 
in october  we completed dosing in healthy volunteers 
no serious adverse events were reported 
dosing in the patient portion of the study commenced in october and has recently concluded 
in this part of the study  patients received single oral doses every other day over days  at doses of either mg  mg or mg  with six subjects receiving ana and two receiving placebo in each dose cohort 
to date  we have received data from the mg and mg cohorts and from seven out of the eight patients in the mg cohort 
no serious adverse events have been reported and there were no discontinuations from the patient portion of the study 
at the mg and mg dose levels minimal immune induction and no significant viral load decrease was noted 
at the mg dose level  initial indications of immune induction and viral load decrease were seen in three of the five patients who have received ana for whom we have data 
we are in the process of analyzing this data and we are considering the possibility of exploring a higher dose level 
results from preclinical pharmacology studies showed that ana elicited desired immune responses influenced by both dose and schedule of administration 
results of completed toxicology studies showed that with every other day dosing of ana  immune stimulation of a magnitude believed to confer therapeutic potential could be achieved in animals without adverse toxicology findings 
ana for cancer tlr agonists are of particular interest because there is precedent for their use in cancer and small molecule ligands for this receptor have been identified 
topical imiquimod aldara is approved for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma in the united states us  and has demonstrated activity against other tumor types including melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia 

table of contents immunotherapy is potentially synergistic with other treatment modalities and new approaches to manipulate conventional cancer therapies to work in concert with the immune system are being explored 
we are currently conducting a phase i clinical trial in the united states in cancer patients under a us ind 
this trial is a safety and tolerability study designed to identify pharmacologically active doses and establish the profile of immune stimulation  which information is intended to support the future design of clinical trials of ana alone or in combinations in specific tumor types 
we are in the early stages of drug development with both ana and ana substantial further investment by us will be necessary in order to progress our product candidates beyond the events referenced above and through additional clinical testing before we will be able to seek regulatory approval 
industry background based on available market data  we estimate that the global hcv market in was between and billion 
due to significant global prevalence and substantial unmet medical need  improving the treatment of chronic hcv virus infection remains an important priority for the medical community and the pharmaceutical industry 
many patients with chronic hcv infection do not receive the current standard of care due to concerns about adverse events or have incomplete response to the current standard of care 
if untreated or inadequately treated  chronic hcv infection can result in significant liver damage cirrhosis  liver transplantation and liver cancer 
the world health organization who estimates that million persons globally are chronically infected with hcv and to million persons are newly infected each year 
cirrhosis develops in about to of persons with chronic infection  and liver cancer develops in to of persons with chronic infection over a period of to years 
it is estimated that more than million people are chronically infected with hcv in the us and that only about  of these patients are currently under treatment 
the national institutes of health estimates that hcv results in  to  deaths in the us annually and the center for disease control and prevention estimates that the number of deaths could increase to nearly  by hcv also exacerbates the severity of underlying liver disease when it coexists with other hepatic conditions 
in particular  liver disease progresses more rapidly among persons with alcoholic liver disease and hcv infection 
there is currently no vaccine available to prevent infection with hcv 
the current standard of care for treatment of chronic hcv infection is a combination of pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin 
interferon alpha is administrated by injection and results in abnormally high levels of this cytokine circulating systemically throughout the body 
therapy with interferon alpha causes a number of side effects in many patients  including depression  drops in blood cell count and flu like symptoms  sometimes experienced during the entire year long primary course of therapy that is standard for treatment of patients infected with genotype hcv  the most difficult patient group to treat 
these side effects may make patients feel worse than foregoing treatment  which reduces their motivation to initiate or continue hcv therapy 
many patients take additional drugs to treat these side effects  further increasing the cost and the risk of additional side effects to the patient 
as a result  poor compliance with the hcv course of therapy may decrease the patient response rate 
in addition to the side effects  current therapies do not provide sustained elimination of the virus  called sustained virologic response svr  for a large proportion of chronically infected patients 
for example  in clinical trials  approximately percent of the genotype patients  which represent the largest portion of hcv patients in the us  europe and japan  do not achieve sustained virologic response six months after the end of the treatment 
due to the lack of alternative treatments  patients without a sustained virologic response have no other treatment option but to undergo a second week course of interferon alpha based therapy with a different brand of interferon alpha 
this second course of therapy subjects the relapsed patient to a similar risk of side effects as the previous course of therapy and offers the benefit of svr in only a small fraction of patients who complete the week treatment 
in response to the limitations of existing treatments for hcv infection  direct antiviral therapies both protease and polymerase inhibitors have emerged as a potential addition to or alternative to the current standard of care 
unlike interferons  which work by stimulating the immune system s response to viral infection  hcv direct antivirals directly target the virus by inhibiting the protease or polymerase 
accordingly  direct antivirals have the potential to significantly improve treatment outcomes  when added to the standard of care in difficult to treat patients  including patients infected with hcv genotype the addition of direct antivirals to the standard of care could also lead to shorter treatment duration  which could increase patient compliance 
while direct antivirals will likely initially be used in combination with pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin  it may be possible eventually to replace one or both components of the current treatment regimen with a combination of oral therapies directed at hcv  including both protease and polymerase inhibitors 

table of contents quantification of viral concentration viral load in the blood is an accepted surrogate of clinical effect in viral diseases 
new treatments are evaluated on the ability to decrease or eliminate detectable viral particles in blood 
with viral load as an accepted surrogate  proof of concept in the treatment of viral diseases can be obtained in phase i human clinical trials 
we believe this early proof of concept results in a higher probability of success post phase i than the probability of success associated with drug development in many other therapeutic areas 
cancer cancer remains a disease with significant unmet medical need 
each year  an estimated million people worldwide are diagnosed with cancer and more than half will eventually die from their disease 
according to the american cancer society  the number of new cancer cases in the united states is projected at million for  and approximately one out of every two men  and one out of every three women  will develop cancer during his or her lifetime 
cancer accounts for nearly one quarter of all deaths in the united states  exceeded only by heart disease 
cancer treatment today current treatments for cancer include surgery  chemotherapy  and radiation  as well as small molecules  antibodies  hormone therapy  and other targeted agents 
surgical and radiation treatments are limited in their effectiveness because they treat the tumor at a specific site  may not remove all the cancer cells  and are not effective if the cancer has spread beyond its initial site 
chemotherapy can treat the cancer at multiple sites  but causes severe side effects because it destroys healthy cells and tissues as well as cancer cells 
in many cases  chemotherapy can only reduce tumors in size and not eliminate them completely  resulting in disease recurrence 
targeted molecular therapies  including antibody and small molecule therapies  have shown promise  but typically are most effective for only subsets of the patient population 
furthermore  all drug therapies  both new and old  have been vulnerable to the emergence of tumor resistance and disease recurrence 
several clinical observations support the importance of tumor immune surveillance in humans 
the increased risk of tumor development in immunosuppressed patients  cases of spontaneous tumor regression and the presence of tumor reactive t cells and b cells correlating with improved prognosis all point to a role for the immune system in controlling tumor growth 
immunotherapy has had success in treating certain tumors and this approach remains of interest for improving cancer treatment options 
immunotherapy is potentially synergistic with other treatment modalities and new approaches to manipulate conventional cancer therapies to work in concert with the immune system will be explored 
rational combinations and sequences of therapy  coupled with treatment strategies based on emerging understanding of immunobiology  may result in therapies that control and or eradicate established cancer 
toll like receptors toll like receptors or tlrs are a relatively new scientific discovery  though their origins date back hundreds of millions of years 
tlrs evolved as a way to protect organisms against pathogens such as viruses and bacteria 
this defense mechanism has proven so effective that it is an integral part of the human immune system today and a promising target for innovative new medicines 
in  the first human tlr was cloned 
to date  scientists have discovered tlrs in humans  each recognizing generic molecular patterns associated with a variety of invading pathogens 
tlr agonists in viral diseases certain tlrs are responsible for fighting bacterial and fungal infections  others respond specifically to viral infections 
unlike adaptive immunity  which enables the immune system to remember and fight specific infections that it has encountered before  innate immunity is the ability to recognize foreign invaders upon their very first meeting 
this function is regulated in part by tlrs  a family of proteins that serve as a first line of defense in the body 
once a tlr recognizes a particular pathogen  it launches a dual assault 
first  it triggers the body s innate immunity  initiating an inflammatory response to fight the invader that includes induction of interferon  a natural disease fighter that is the basis for many approved products 
it then alerts and educates the body s adaptive immune system so that it will recognize the pathogen in the future 
if tlrs fail  the body is left vulnerable to infection 

table of contents tlr agonists in cancer as key regulators of both innate and adaptive immune responses  tlrs have been shown in research studies to affect several diseases  including cancer 
clinical studies have demonstrated that activation of tlr is effective in treating certain cancers that appear on the skin 
specifically  topical imiquimod aldara is approved for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma 
unfortunately  however  imiquimod is poorly tolerated when administered orally  limiting its utility for broader indications requiring systemic exposure 
additional justification for the investigation of tlr agonists for the treatment of cancer comes from the many studies conducted with tlr agonists 
tlr and tlr agonists share common signaling pathways  partially overlap in cell type expression  and have comparable direct and indirect activities as immunostimulants 
a large body of data exists from animal models and human studies suggesting the potential utility of appropriately modified natural agonists of tlr either in monotherapy or combination therapy for the treatment of cancer 
tlr and tlr agonists are  however  administered differently to patients tlr agonists can be administered orally  while tlr agonists are thus far only injectable 
our strategy the key elements of our strategy include the following advance the development of ana in hcv 
we are developing ana  a non nucleoside inhibitor of the hcv nsb polymerase 
during we intend to complete the phase ib clinical trial in hcv infected patients  and announce the full data set from all dose cohorts during the second quarter of  complete a day trial in healthy subjects and receive data from that trial in the second quarter of  complete the manufacturing of drug substance and drug product necessary to initiate phase ii studies of ana by the middle of  complete six and nine month toxicology studies of ana  which are designed to enable dosing up to weeks in phase ii studies  and contingent on the receipt of additional funding  conduct phase ii studies of ana in combination with the current standard of care pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin 
advance the development of ana in hcv 
we have recently completed dosing in a phase i clinical trial of ana in hcv patients 
during we intend to analyze the data from the mg dose level in hcv infected patients  assess the possibility of exploring a higher dose in hcv infected patients  and pending completion of the analysis of the mg dose level and potentially the results of a higher dose level  determine the business case for proceeding into phase ii and further non clinical activities necessary to support phase ii trials with ana as a therapy for hcv infection 
advance the development of ana in cancer 
we are currently conducting a phase i clinical trial of ana in cancer patients 
during we intend to explore the pharmacodynamic response in cancer patients  select the tumor types for potential phase ii evaluation  and select the dose and schedule for potential phase ii clinical trials 
pursue the development of novel  high quality product candidates in major disease areas 
we select our product candidates based on demonstrated properties that suggest the potential to change treatment paradigms and become important products in time 
our strategy is to couple high quality candidates with a disciplined investment approach  pursuing time and cost efficient paths to obtaining clinical data 
opportunistically explore strategic alliances around our product candidates 
we intend to explore potential strategic alliances and other transactions around ana and ana 
table of contents we currently have no ongoing collaborations 
our development programs ana for hcv ana is a direct antiviral that blocks the hepatitis c virus ability to multiply by inhibiting the viral rna polymerase 
ana belongs to a class of direct antivirals referred to as non nucleosides 
we believe non nucleosides will become an important component of future combination regimens used to treat hcv infection  similar to the role played by non nucleoside inhibitors in hiv therapy 
in we selected ana as a development candidate 
this selection represented the culmination of a comprehensive structure based drug design program directed towards the viral rna polymerase 
ana has demonstrated the preclinical properties  including potency  pharmacokinetics and early safety  that we believe are prerequisites for successful development in the hcv area and has recently demonstrated proof of viral load reduction in hcv infected patients in our phase ib study described below 
we believe that non nucleoside nsb polymerase inhibitors offer an exciting potential new way to target treating hcv infection  as part of combination regimens which may include other direct antivirals such as protease inhibitors and or nucleosides polymerase inhibitors and or immunomodulators such as pegylated interferon 
we believe that polymerase inhibitors have the potential to be equally important components of future regimens as protease inhibitors  which is another class of hcv direct antivirals currently in clinical development by a number of companies  including vertex with mitsubishi and johnson johnson and schering plough 
historically  it has been challenging to identify non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors that display both potency and sustained drug levels in blood 
with ana  we believe we have created a product candidate that has the potential to overcome this challenge 
we believe that we have the opportunity to be competitive in the effort to develop non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors for the treatment of hcv  since  to our knowledge the number of non nucleosides in development is smaller than the number of potentially attractive combinations that can be formed with attractive protease inhibitors and nucleoside polymerase inhibitors in development 
we believe that the future evolution of hcv therapy will likely include protease inhibitors  nucleosides and non nucleosides used in various combinations 
therefore  we view ana as complementary to  rather than competitive with  protease inhibitors and nucleosides that are currently in development as hcv therapies 
preclinical evaluation of ana required for initiation of clinical investigation was completed in the first quarter of  leading to submission of an ind to the fda  subsequent allowance of the ind by the fda and initiation of clinical investigation in the second quarter of in december  we announced that the fda granted fast track designation to ana for the treatment of chronic hcv infection 
ana is currently being investigated in a phase ib patient study in which patients are to receive ana twice daily over three days at dose levels of either mg  mg or mg 
in january we announced results from the first cohort of this study which demonstrated a log median viral load decline after three days of dosing in the eight patients who received mg of ana twice daily 
subsequent to this announcement  we determined that  due to drug dispensing errors in the clinic  a small number of patients intended to receive the next dose level inadvertently received ana mg or matching placebo  including two additional genotype a patients and one additional genotype b patient who received active ana taking into account these additional patients  the median viral load decline at the end of treatment was log with a range of log for the eleven patients who received ana at mg twice daily 
the five genotype a patients who received ana demonstrated a median viral load decline of log  while the six genotype b patients who received ana demonstrated a median viral load decline of log the results further indicated that ana was very well tolerated at the mg twice daily dose level and no serious adverse events were reported  although conclusions regarding longer term safety and tolerability cannot be made until the results of future clinical trials of longer duration in more patients are known 
following our announcement of the data from the patients who received the mg dose level  we continued to enroll the subsequent dose cohorts  dosing patients with either placebo  or mg or mg twice daily over three days 
we are nearing completion of dosing in the phase ib study and expect to receive and analyze the safety and viral load data from the mg and mg dose cohorts over the course of the next several weeks 
we intend to release the full data from all three dose cohorts during the second quarter of we are also currently conducting a clinical trial of ana in healthy subjects to evaluate the steady state pharmacokinetics  safety and tolerability of multiple doses of ana administered orally over a day period 
approximately forty subjects are to 
table of contents participate in the trial and will receive doses of ana ranging from mg to mg once daily or mg twice daily 
we expect to have data from this study in the second quarter of in a phase i study in healthy volunteers conducted in  ana was administered as capsules at single oral doses of mg  mg  mg  mg fed and fasted and mg 
in addition  a separate cohort received two mg doses hours apart 
ana was well tolerated at all doses and there were no serious adverse events or withdrawals from the study 
all reported adverse events were classified as mild or moderate  with no apparent dose relationship 
the pharmacokinetic profile demonstrated sustained plasma levels of ana consistent with the potential for once daily or twice daily oral dosing 
in the preclinical program  ana was well tolerated at all doses tested in day glp toxicology studies 
in september  we initiated six and nine month chronic toxicology studies of ana contingent on successful completion these long term toxicology studies are designed to support dosing up to weeks in phase ii studies 
we have conducted in vitro laboratory studies that showed ana has the potential to be synergistic with interferon alpha  and additive to synergistic with the protease inhibitor telaprevir vx  and the nucleoside polymerase inhibitor psi the active agent of r 
synergistic means that the actual combined effect of the two agents is greater than would be predicted from simply adding the effects of each agent alone 
additive to synergistic means that at a minimum the combined actual effect of the two agents together equals what would be predicted by adding their individual effects additive  and that upon reaching certain threshold concentrations the two agents begin to act in a synergistic fashion 
these studies also showed that ana retained activity against hcv mutants known to confer resistance to other classes of direct antivirals  including protease inhibitors  nucleoside inhibitors and non nucleosides that bind at a specific structural site the thumb site in the hcv nsb polymerase enzyme 
hcv mutants resistant to ana have been shown to be fully susceptible to interferon alpha  telaprevir vx and psi we have also presented data demonstrating synergy between ana and immunoregulatory proteins termed cytokines induced by ana  anadys tlr agonist oral prodrug  also in development for hepatitis c 
if ana is successful in early stage development  we anticipate completing in mid the clinical  toxicology and manufacturing activities required to initiate longer term  phase ii  studies of ana in combination with current standard of care 
ana for hcv in july  we resumed investigation of the tlr mechanism for hcv by taking ana into a clinical trial designed to test ana in both healthy volunteers and patients with hcv 
this trial is being conducted in the netherlands 
in the healthy volunteer portion of the study  which concluded in october  subjects received a single dose followed by four doses taken every other day  at levels from mg to mg  with six subjects receiving ana and two receiving placebo in each dose cohort 
no serious adverse events were reported 
biomarker induction indicative of immune activation was seen in a majority of healthy volunteers beginning at mg 
some side effects commonly seen with interferon treatment  including fever and chills  were observed at higher doses 
the frequency and intensity of interferon like side effects increased with dose  and one healthy volunteer at the mg dose and two healthy volunteers at the mg dose discontinued from the trial before completion of dosing 
dosing in the patient portion of the study commenced in october and recently concluded 
in this part of the study  patients received single oral doses every other day over days  at doses of either mg  mg or mg  with six subjects receiving ana and two receiving placebo in each dose cohort 
to date  we have received data from the mg and mg cohorts and seven out of the eight patients in the mg cohort 
no serious adverse events have been reported and there were no discontinuations from the patient portion of the study 
at the mg and mg dose levels minimal immune induction and no significant viral load decrease was noted 
at the mg dose level  initial indications of immune induction and viral load decrease were seen in three of the five patients for whom we have data 
we are in the process of analyzing this data and we are considering the possibility of exploring a higher dose level 
results from pre clinical pharmacology studies showed that ana elicited desired immune responses and that the profile of response could be modulated by both dose and schedule of administration 
results of week glp toxicology studies showed that with every other day dosing of ana  immune stimulation of a magnitude believed to confer therapeutic potential could be achieved without adverse toxicology findings 
the immune stimulation observed with every other day dosing of ana in monkeys included induction of interferon alpha and interferon dependent responses at levels that were sustained over weeks of dosing 
the toxicology results from every other day dosing of ana over weeks contrast with results from prior week animal toxicology studies that utilized daily dosing of ana  a tlr agonist prodrug previously in development by us for the treatment of 
table of contents chronic hepatitis c 
in initial week animal toxicology studies of ana dosed daily  unexpected findings associated with intense immune stimulation were observed 
when lower daily doses of ana were then explored in a subsequent week animal toxicology study  adverse findings were noted even at dose levels where desired immunostimulatory effects were not measurable  following which the decision was made in to discontinue development of ana ana for cancer we are also developing ana as a potential treatment for cancer 
ana stimulates the body s immune system through activation of the tlr receptor 
the pharmacologic consequences of tlr activation are broad and include induction of cytokines such as interferon alpha as well as activation of immune effector cell populations known as natural killer nk cells and cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls 
the cytokine induction and cellular activation mechanisms both offer the potential for direct control of tumor cell growth 
furthermore  there is evidence to support the concept that activation of nk and ctl cells may be beneficial in enhancing the effect of existing cancer therapies  including monoclonal antibodies and certain chemotherapies 
we are developing ana with this broad potential in mind 
in our first clinical study we plan to identify a safe and well tolerated dose of ana  as well as assess pharmacodynamic activity reflected by induction of cytokines and activation of nk cells and ctls at various doses and schedules 
we expect to have a portion of this information in hand during the first half of  which will position ana for subsequent clinical investigations in specific tumor types  alone and in combination with other agents 
clinical observations provide direct evidence of the importance of the immune system in controlling cancer in humans  including the increased risk of cancer in patients with an immune system that is not functioning normally and the correlation between cancer survival and the degree to which tumors are recognized as abnormal by lymphocytes 
the host immune system plays an essential role in controlling the ability of cancer cells to multiply  invade and metastasize 
immune system surveillance identifies cells within the body that have been transformed by dna damage and targets them for destruction before they multiply and metastasize 
it is believed that every human would rapidly develop cancer were it not for this immune surveillance 
although not widely recognized  many currently approved cancer therapies actually rely on some aspect of the host immune system as an integral aspect of their mechanism of action 
for example  many therapeutic monoclonal antibodies work by tagging tumor cells for recognition and removal by nk cells 
in light of the successes with these classes of therapy  there remains considerable interest among many oncologists  or cancer doctors  to more broadly utilize immune activation as a therapeutic approach  alone and in combination with other therapies 
the potential benefits of the tlr mechanism in cancer therapy arise from the fundamental role of this receptor in immune activation 
tlr plays a gatekeeper function during infection  recognizing that a pathogen the microscopic organisms that cause infection is present and triggering responses that lead to control and elimination of the pathogen 
we are seeking to harness these same immunological responses as a way to potentially control and eliminate cancer cells from the body 
the tlr receptor is expressed in certain cell types that play key roles in the immune system 
the potential benefit of a tlr agonist in treating cancer may arise from direct action in immunological cells that express tlr for example  certain b cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll and non hodgkin s lymphoma nhl may respond because the b cells that lie at the heart of these malignancies can self destruct upon tlr activation 
alternatively  the benefit in cancer may arise from action against cells that do not express the tlr receptor but respond to immune system components that become stimulated upon tlr activation 
immune system components that become activated include nk cells and ctls and circulating cytokines 
these stimulated components of the immune system can directly eliminate tumor cells and may also enhance the activity of certain existing cancer therapies  including some monoclonal antibodies and certain chemotherapies 
over time in our ana development program  we may explore several of these avenues for potential utility of a tlr agonist in cancer 
there is a degree of precedent to support the use of the tlr mechanism in cancer 
one marketed product that works by stimulating the immune system via the tlr mechanism is imiquimod aldara 
while the fda approved indications for imiquimod are limited to topical treatment of skin diseases  such as superficial basal cell carcinoma  actinic keratosis and warts induced by the human papillomavirus  there are several reports of imiquimod demonstrating activity against skin metastases from solid tumors  such as breast cancer 
however  to date no one has successfully developed an oral tlr agonist for cancer 
we believe the combination of our prodrug approach  described below  and our understanding of tlr pharmacology provides us an opportunity to utilize the tlr mechanism to systemically treat a broad spectrum of cancers  including solid tumors and b cell diseases  with oral administration of ana ana is a prodrug of an active tlr agonist we believe may confer benefit in cancer treatment 
as a prodrug  ana itself does not activate the tlr receptor 
rather  the body s metabolic processes transform ana to an active form after absorption from the digestive tract  resulting in the active tlr agonist circulating in the blood 
both ana and the active agent it delivers 
table of contents were designed and synthesized by our scientists 
the use of a prodrug provides for efficient delivery of the active agent to the bloodstream and avoids undesirable effects of an active tlr agent in the digestive tract prior to absorption 
we have shown in multiple preclinical studies that oral delivery of ana produced the desired blood concentrations of the active agent and provided immune stimulation 
in our clinical investigations  we are administering ana orally 
we have reported the activity of ana and its active form at multiple scientific conferences 
in october  we presented data showing that activation of tlr in vivo by the active form of ana leads to the expected cellular responses  including activation of nk cells and ctls 
earlier in  we presented data from an in vitro study demonstrating that ana and its active metabolite stimulate secretion of interferon alpha and enhance direct tumor cell killing by nk cells 
in addition to enhancing direct nk cell killing  the active metabolite of ana also enhanced the ability of rituximab  an antibody against cd  to trigger immune mediated cell killing of transformed b cells 
we have also presented data from in vivo preclinical studies showing that the schedule of administration had a significant effect on the profile of immune stimulation induced by ana alternating dosing with periods of no dosing led to more robust nk cell activation and more stable levels of interferon alpha induction  compared to chronic daily administration 
we anticipate that different dosing schedules may be required in different tumor settings 
in the fourth quarter of the fda accepted our ind application to commence clinical investigation of ana in advanced cancer patients and we are currently conducting a phase i clinical trial in the united states 
the phase i clinical trial of ana is a multiple  ascending dose study conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors 
in addition to safety and tolerability  patients are to be monitored for pharmacodynamic responses indicative of immunological stimulation 
during  we intend to select the tumor types for phase ii exploration and identify the dose and schedule for potential future phase ii clinical trials 
manufacturing and supply all of our manufacturing is out sourced to third parties  with control by our internal managers 
we rely on third party manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of ana and ana for use in clinical trials 
we intend to continue this practice for any future clinical trials and large scale commercialization of ana and ana both of our current product candidates are small molecule drugs 
historically  these drugs have been simpler and less expensive to manufacture than biologic drugs 
intellectual property our policy is to pursue patents and to otherwise endeavor to protect our technology  inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business 
we also rely upon trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technology  inventions and improvements we consider important to our business  defend and enforce our patents  preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets  and operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties 
we hold issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states  and in foreign countries we deem appropriate  covering intellectual property developed as part of our research and development programs 
our intellectual property holdings include  but are not limited to  united states and or foreign patents and patent applications covering ana and or other non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors  united states and or foreign patents and patent applications covering ana and or other tlr agonists  as well as united states and foreign patent applications covering the manufacture  pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use of these compounds 
we intend to continue using our scientific expertise to pursue and file patent applications on new developments with respect to uses  methods and compositions of matter in order to enhance our intellectual property position in our areas of therapeutic focus 

table of contents we intend to aggressively prosecute our patent applications and enforce and defend our patents and otherwise protect our proprietary technology 
although we believe our rights under patents and patent applications provide a competitive advantage  the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions

competition the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are very competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
our product candidates  if approved for sale  will compete with existing therapies 
in addition  a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and medical conditions that we are targeting 
we believe that a significant number of drugs are currently under development and may become available in the future for the treatment of hcv and cancer 
due to the level of focus on developing treatments for these indications  ongoing research efforts are intense and new treatments are being sought out and developed by our competitors 
some of these products use therapeutic approaches that may compete directly or indirectly with ana or ana in addition  less expensive generic forms of currently marketed drugs could lead to additional competition upon patent expiration or invalidations 
hcv treating hcv with interferon based therapies current standard treatments for hcv include an interferon based product combined with ribavirin 
although interferons result in antiviral effects  they are injectable products and cause numerous side effects 
next generation interferon based products  so called pegylated interferons  were developed to provide an improved dosing regimen and are approved as once per week injected products 
currently approved therapies for the treatment of hcv infection include peg intron pegylated interferon alpha b and intron a interferon alpha b  which are marketed by schering plough  pegasys pegylated interferon alpha a and roferon a interferon alpha a  which are marketed by roche and several branded and generic versions of ribavirin 
many patients experience unpleasant side effects when receiving interferon based products  including flu like symptoms such as fatigue  pyrexia  myalgia  cough  headache  and rigors  psychiatric reactions  such as depression  irritability and anxiety  as well as neutropenia and thyroid dysfunction 
due to the nature of hcv infection  patients may not show any symptoms from the hcv itself when they initiate therapy 
ironically  harsh side effects often make patients feel sicker than the disease itself 
as a result  physicians often delay treatment of hcv infected patients until tests of liver function demonstrate initial liver degeneration due to the infection 
in clinical studies  harsh side effects have caused discontinuation of treatment in approximately to percent of patients 
these side effects also require additional drug therapies  which increase the cost to the patient 
further  the optimal dose  treatment length and response rates to interferon and ribavirin therapy vary considerably based on hcv genotype and mode of therapy  ie  monotherapy or combination therapy 

table of contents direct antivirals in development for treating hcv in response to the limitations of existing treatments for hcv infection  the development of direct antiviral therapies both protease and polymerase inhibitors has emerged as a potential addition to or alternative to the standard treatment 
unlike interferons  which work by stimulating the immune system s response to viral infection  hcv direct antivirals directly target the virus by inhibiting the protease or polymerase 
accordingly  direct antivirals may significantly improve treatment outcomes  when added to the standard of care in difficult to treat patients  including patients infected with hcv genotype  relative to treatment with the standard of care alone 
the addition of direct antivirals to the standard of care could also lead to shorter treatment duration  which could increase patient compliance 
while direct antivirals will likely initially be used in combination with pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin  it may be possible eventually to replace one or both components of the current treatment regimen with a combination of oral therapies directed at hcv  including both protease and polymerase inhibitors 
ana belongs to a class of direct antivirals known as non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors 
if approved  ana would likely be used in combination with the current standard of care and or other direct antiviral agents such as protease inhibitors and other polymerase inhibitors 
although any product currently approved or approved in the future for the treatment of hcv infection could potentially decrease or eliminate the commercial opportunity of ana  we expect that in a combination setting a non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor would be complementary with a protease inhibitor and a nucleoside polymerase inhibitor 
we believe that other non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors would likely be the most direct competitors of ana  but depending on the resistance profiles of the compounds  it is possible that even two non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors could be complementary 
to our knowledge  other non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor programs are currently under clinical evaluation by pfizer  gilead  merck  abbott  boehringer ingleheim and virochem 
further  a number of companies have non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor research programs 
additional compounds in late stage clinical trials for hcv that may be complementary to or competitive with ana include albuferon  in development by human genome sciences and novartis  telaprevir  in development by vertex pharmaceuticals  janssen pharmaceutica and mitsubishi tanabe pharma  boceprevir and sch  in development by schering plough  itmn  in development by intermune and roche  tmc  in development by tibotec and medivir  mk  in development by merck  bi  in development by boehringer ingelheim  and r in development by pharmasset and roche 
immunological agents in development for the treating hcv due to the side effects and poor treatment response to interferon therapy discussed above  there are currently a number of agents in development that could potentially replace today s pegylated interferons 
ana is an oral prodrug of a tlr agonist under evaluation for the treatment of hcv 
there are a number of agents in clinical development that could potentially compete with ana as new agents for the treatment of hcv  including  albuferon  in development by novartis and human genome sciences  and locteron  in development by biolex therapeutics  both of which are longer acting versions of interferon alfa 
also  in development as potential improvements to existing interferons are peg interferon lambda  in development by zymogenetics and bristol myers squibb  and omega interferon in development by intarcia therapeutics 
imo  a tlr agonist in development by idera  is also being studied in early stage clinical trials in hcv patients and pf  an oral tlr agonist is in development by pfizer for hcv 
cancer current treatments for cancer include surgery  chemotherapy  and radiation  as well as small molecules  antibodies  hormone therapy  and other targeted agents 
surgical and radiation treatments are limited in their effectiveness because they treat the tumor at a specific site  may not remove all the cancer cells  and are not effective if the cancer has spread beyond its initial site 
chemotherapy can treat the cancer at multiple sites  but causes severe side effects because it destroys healthy cells and tissues as well as cancer cells 
in many cases  chemotherapy can only reduce tumors in size and not eliminate them completely  resulting in disease recurrence 
targeted molecular therapies  including antibody and small molecule therapies  have shown promise  but typically are most effective for only subsets of the patient population 
furthermore  all drug therapies  both new and old  have been vulnerable to the emergence of tumor resistance and disease recurrence 
ana is a prodrug of a tlr agonist under evaluation for oncology indications 
any product currently approved or approved in the future for the treatment of cancer could decrease or eliminate the commercial opportunity of ana programs that most directly compete with ana at this time are several tlr agonists under evaluation for oncology indications  including imo  in development by idera and merck kgaa  and a cancer program in development by dynavax 

table of contents competitive risks to date  we have only conducted short term phase i clinical trials of ana and ana therefore  it is difficult to predict the efficacy  safety and tolerability that these product candidates will demonstrate in longer term trials  alone or in combination with other agents 
it is also difficult to predict how these product candidates will interact with other product candidates in development or on the market  until we perform combination studies 
further  it is difficult to predict whether our product candidates will cause any toxicity issues  potential side effects  or other negative consequences associated with their long term use 
during the course of future clinical trials  we may discover that these product candidates are less effective  require unacceptable dosing regimens  or have a similar side effect profile as the profile associated with current therapies or future competitors 
this may result in our product candidates being less advantageous or less desirable from a patient and treating physician perspective as compared to current therapies for hcv or cancer 
we face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies both in the us and abroad 
our competitors may utilize discovery technologies and techniques or partner with collaborators in order to develop products more rapidly or successfully than we or our future collaborators are able to do 
many of our competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical companies  have substantially greater financial  technical and human resources than we do and far more experience in the discovery and development of product candidates and the commercialization of potential products 
in addition  academic institutions  government agencies  and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies 
these organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors 
we believe that our ability to compete depends  in part  upon our ability to create  maintain and license scientifically advanced technology 
further  we need to attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary technology or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the substantial time period between technological conception and commercial sales of products based upon our technology 
we expect that competition among hcv and cancer therapies approved for sale will be based on various factors  including improved product efficacy  safety and tolerability  ease of administration eg  oral vs 
intravenous administration  availability  price  reimbursement status and patent position 
potential competitors may develop treatments for hcv or cancer that are more effective and or safer or more convenient than our product candidates or that would make our technology and product candidates obsolete or non competitive 
government regulations we are subject to regulation by the fda and comparable regulatory agencies in foreign countries with respect to the development and commercialization of products and services resulting from our drug discovery activities 
these agencies and other federal  state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing  manufacture  quality control  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  advertising and promotion of these products and services 
as an initial step in the drug approval process of pharmaceuticals  an applicant typically conducts preclinical laboratory and animal studies of the product candidate 
following these studies  the applicant will submit an investigational new drug or equivalent ind application to the fda or comparable foreign regulatory agency 
once the ind becomes effective  the applicant can commence clinical studies of the product candidate in humans to determine safety  tolerability and efficacy 
following clinical studies  the marketing of a new drug requires the filing of a new drug application nda with the fda and its subsequent approval similar requirements exist within foreign agencies 
the process required by the fda and comparable agencies before a pharmaceutical or biologic device may be marketed in the us or in any other country generally requires many years and substantial effort and financial resources  and approval from the fda may not be received in a timely manner  if at all 
the time required to satisfy fda requirements or similar requirements of foreign regulatory agencies may vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product or the targeted disease 
even if a product receives regulatory approval  later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market 
under the fda s regulations  the clinical testing program required for marketing approval of a new drug typically involves three sequential phases  which may overlap 
phase i studies are conducted on normal  healthy human volunteers or patients to determine safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion 
if possible  phase i studies may also be designed to gain early evidence of effectiveness 

table of contents phase ii studies are conducted on small groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease to gain preliminary evidence of efficacy  to determine the common short term side effects and risks associated with the substance being tested and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage 
phase iii involves large scale studies conducted on disease afflicted patients to provide statistical evidence of efficacy and safety and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling 
frequent reports are required in each phase  and  if unwarranted hazards to subjects are found  the fda may request modification or discontinuance of clinical testing until further preclinical testing is conducted 
additional testing phase iv may be conducted after fda approval for marketing is granted and could be designed to evaluate alternative utilizations of drug products prior to their being marketed for such additional utilizations as well as to test for complications resulting from long term exposure not revealed in earlier clinical testing 
environmental and safety matters certain of our development activities involve the controlled use of biological  hazardous and radioactive materials and waste 
we are also subject to numerous federal  state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products 
the cost of compliance with and any violation of these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  we cannot assure investors that accidental contamination or injury from these materials will not occur 
to date  compliance with laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or our competitive position 
however  we are not able to predict the extent of government regulation  and the cost and effect thereof on our results of operations  which might result from any legislative or administrative action pertaining to environmental or safety matters 
in the event of contamination or injury  we could be held liable for substantial damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources  and our clinical trials could be suspended 
in addition  we may have to incur significant costs to comply with future environmental laws and regulations 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the discovery  preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates 
research and development expenses are the primary source of our expenses and totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

risk factors you should consider carefully the following information about the risks described below  together with the other information contained in this annual report and in our other public filings before making any investment decisions regarding our stock 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected 
in these circumstances  the market price of our common stock would likely decline  and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock 
risks related to our business our business is heavily centered around our ana program 
any unexpected data or other challenges we may encounter in the ana program could delay or preclude our ability to transition to phase ii trials of ana  which could cause our stock price to decline significantly 
our planned clinical development timelines for ana are structured with the objective that if ana is successful in early stage development  we expect to be ready to initiate longer term clinical trials  known as phase ii studies  of ana with current standard of care treatments in mid we are currently conducting a phase ib clinical trial of ana in hcv infected patients  in which patients are dosed twice daily for three days  and a phase i clinical trial in healthy volunteers in which subjects are dosed once or twice daily over a fourteen day period 
if we see adverse toxicity or other unexpected results  or experience any other challenges  in our early clinical trials or any concurrently run animal toxicology studies  or with the manufacturing of our clinical trial materials  our desired timelines for the program could be detrimentally impacted 
if the ana program is not ready to transition to phase ii studies consistent with our stated timelines  our ability to enter into a strategic alliance around ana or raise additional capital could be adversely affected  and our stock price could decline significantly 
any set back or failure of ana or ana could have a large negative impact on our business and stock price 
our development portfolio currently consists of only ana and ana and thus entails highly concentrated risk of failure 
if one or both of these compounds fail or have set backs  our business and stock price may suffer 
we will need additional funds to conduct phase ii trials of ana and or ana  and we may not be able to obtain such funds 
prior to conducting a full phase ii program of ana and or ana for the treatment of hcv or a phase ii program of ana for the treatment of cancer  we will need to obtain additional funds 
however  we may not be successful in obtaining such funds 
potential sources of additional funds include a new strategic alliance or other transaction  the sale of equity securities  project financing or debt financing 
we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available when we need it  especially in this current tumultuous economic environment  or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we are unable to raise additional funds on our desired timelines  we may need to postpone the initiation of phase ii trials until we obtain such funds  which may cause our stock price to decline significantly 
our strategy to engage in a strategic alliance could fail 
we are currently in discussions with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies regarding potential strategic alliances and other transactions around ana and ana however  completing transactions of this nature is difficult and time consuming and there is no guarantee that we will be able to complete a transaction on our desired time line or on terms acceptable to us 
potentially interested parties may terminate discussions based upon their assessment of our competitive  financial  regulatory or intellectual property position or any other reason 
furthermore  depending on the outcome of our ongoing discussions  we may delay further activity in this area until  when we expect to have day viral load data from our ana program 
if we make such a 
table of contents determination and choose to suspend further activity in this area during  or if we are unable for any reason to enter into a transaction this year  we will need to obtain funding through alternative means  most likely through the sale of additional equity securities  in order to proceed with phase ii studies of ana however  there is no guarantee that we will be able sell equity securities on favorable terms  or at all 
furthermore  the sale of equity securities by us could potentially result in a perception by the investment community that we were unable to enter into a strategic alliance or other transaction around ana and or ana on favorable terms  or at all  which could significantly reduce the price at which we can sell equity securities 
in addition  if we choose to defer a potential strategic alliance or other transactions around ana and ana until we have longer term viral load data  we and our stockholders will bear the risk that ana or ana will fail prior to any future alliance 
even if we successfully establish new strategic alliances  these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of any product candidates or the generation of sales or royalty revenue 
raising additional funds by issuing securities or through debt or project financing or strategic alliances and licensing arrangements may cause dilution to existing stockholders  restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights 
we may raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  project financings strategic alliances and licensing arrangements 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders ownership will be diluted 
other financing activities may also have an equity component which may lead to dilution 
any debt or project financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations 
these restrictive covenants may include limitations on borrowing  specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens  pay dividends  redeem capital stocks or make investments 
in addition  if we raise additional funds through strategic alliances and licensing arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our potential products or proprietary technologies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
for example  we might be forced to relinquish all or a portion of our sales and marketing rights with respect to potential products or license intellectual property that enables licensees to develop competing products 
we are at an early stage of development  and we may never attain product sales 
our existing organizational structure was formed in may since then  most of our resources have been dedicated to the development of our proprietary drug discovery technologies  research and development and preclinical and early stage clinical testing of compounds 
our current product candidates are at only the very early stages of clinical trials 
ana  ana and any other compounds that we may develop  may never be approved for commercial sales 
these compounds will require extensive and costly development  preclinical testing and clinical trials prior to seeking regulatory approval for commercial sales 
the time required to attain product sales and profitability is lengthy and highly uncertain  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve or maintain product sales 
we expect our net operating losses to continue for at least several years  and we are unable to predict the extent of future losses and when we will become profitable in our business operations  if ever 
we have incurred net operating losses since our incorporation in  and through december  we have an accumulated deficit of million 
our operating losses are attributable in large part to the significant research and development costs required to identify and validate potential product candidates and conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials 
to date  we have generated limited revenues  consisting of one time or limited payments associated with past collaborations or grants  and we do not anticipate generating product revenues for at least several years  if ever 
we expect to increase our operating expenses over at least the next several years in order to fund the development costs of our product candidates and further our development activities 
as a result  we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our research and product development efforts  we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable in our business operations  if ever 
even if we do achieve profitability in our business operations  we may not be able to sustain or increase such profitability on an ongoing basis 
the technologies on which we rely are unproven and may not result in the development of commercially viable products 
our current product candidates  ana and ana  were selected based on the presumption that intervention at their respective targets  hcv polymerase and tlr  offers a therapeutic benefit 
there can be no assurance that intervention at either target will offer sufficient benefit and acceptable toxicity to warrant continued development and approval 
ana relies on the biology of a specific receptor  or protein  named toll like receptor  or tlr however  the interaction between small molecules and tlr represents a relatively new mechanism of action for the treatment of disease  including hcv and cancer  and there is no guarantee that 
table of contents an acceptable balance between therapeutic benefit and risk will be achieved with tlr agonists in hcv infected patients or in cancer patients 
for example  in june we suspended dosing of ana  a tlr agonist prodrug  in our then on going ana clinical trial due to information from week toxicology studies in animals which showed intense immune stimulation 
we subsequently conducted additional pre clinical studies and were unable to identify an acceptable balance between therapeutic benefit and risk using a daily dosing schedule over weeks 
accordingly  we subsequently discontinued the development of ana as a therapy for hcv infection 
the science underlying ana is also new and unproven  as no products acting at the hcv polymerase have been approved for marketing 
ana and ana are at only the very beginning stage of clinical investigation 
the process of successfully discovering product candidates is expensive  time consuming and unpredictable  and the historical rate of failure for drug candidates is extremely high 
if our approaches to drug discovery and development are not successful  we will not be able to establish or maintain a clinical development portfolio or generate product revenue 
because the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results  we can provide no assurances that ana or ana will have favorable results in future clinical trials  or receive regulatory approval 
positive results from preclinical studies or early clinical trials should not be relied upon as evidence that later or larger scale clinical trials will succeed 
there is typically an extremely high rate of attrition from the failure of drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials 
there is no guarantee that viral load declines seen in early patient trials will be replicated in future trials of longer duration and or larger patient populations 
for example  short term viral load data from our ana phase ib study may not translate into long term benefit due to the potential emergence of resistant variants or other factors 
furthermore  if concurrent toxicology studies have unexpected results  the clinical development of the compound at issue could be suspended  delayed and or terminated 
if ana  ana  or any other product candidate  fails to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in any clinical trial or shows unexpected findings in concurrent toxicology studies  we would experience potentially significant delays in  or be required to abandon  development of that product candidate 
if we delay or abandon our development efforts related to ana or ana  we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to become profitable  and our reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be significantly damaged  each of which would cause our stock price to decrease significantly 
we intend to develop ana and ana as components of combination treatments  which presents additional challenges to the drug development process 
we are developing ana and ana as potential components of future combination treatments 
we may face additional challenges with this approach  as opposed to developing product candidates for monotherapy 
for example  any negative properties of our product candidates may be exacerbated when combined with other agents and or have unexpected effects in humans 
furthermore  the optimal development of our product candidates may entail explorations of combinations with other agents  which could require us to establish agreements or alliances with other companies or third parties 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into such alliances or agreements on terms that we view as favorable  or at all 
if we are unable to optimize the development of our product candidates  our business prospects could be harmed  causing our stock price to suffer 
fast track designation does not guarantee approval  or expedited approval  of ana and there is no guarantee that ana will maintain fast track designation 
in december  we announced that the fda granted fast track designation to ana for the treatment of chronic hcv infection 
under the fda modernization act of  fast track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs that are intended to treat serious or life threatening conditions 
compounds selected must demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need for such a condition 
mechanisms intended to facilitate development include opportunities for frequent dialogue with fda reviewers and for timely review of submitted protocols 
however  the designation does not guarantee approval or expedited approval of any application for the product 
furthermore  the fda may revoke fast track designation from a product candidate at any time if it determines that the criteria are no longer met 
we are currently investigating ana in both hcv and cancer 
any setback with the compound in one program could adversely affect our ability to develop it for the other indication  which would cause our business and stock price to suffer 
in july  we announced our plans to investigate ana  our oral tlr agonist prodrug that we have been developing for cancer  as a potential treatment for hepatitis c 
we have recently conducted a phase i clinical trial of ana for hcv and continue to conduct a separate phase i clinical trial in oncology 
although the trials are being conducted separately  any setback with the compound in one program could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop it for the other indication  which would cause our business and stock price to suffer 

table of contents in we terminated our ana development program due to challenges seen in animal toxicology studies 
to the extent that the ana toxicology observations are mechanism related  our ana programs for cancer and hepatitis c could be negatively impacted  causing our stock price to decline 
ana is an oral prodrug of isatoribine  a tlr agonist 
in we discontinued the development of ana as a treatment for hcv infection due to intense immune stimulation in animals 
to the extent that any of the ana toxicology observations are mechanism related  rather than compound specific  we will need to determine whether the level of immune stimulation induced by tlr agonists can be modulated to achieve a potential therapeutic benefit with an acceptable safety profile 
although results from our recently concluded ana week animal toxicology study indicated that with every other day dosing of ana  immune stimulation of a magnitude believed to confer therapeutic potential can be achieved without adverse toxicology findings  there is no guarantee that this favorable toxicology profile will persist in future toxicology studies of longer duration  or that we will not see adverse safety findings in humans 
if we are unable to modulate the immunomodulatory effect with a dose and schedule that provides therapeutic benefit without causing unacceptable adverse events  then the future development of ana may be terminated  which would materially and adversely affect our business and cause our stock price to decline significantly 
we are currently conducting a phase i clinical trial of ana in oncology and are continuing to recruit patients 
if patient enrollment does not move as quickly as we would like  our future development activities for ana in oncology could be delayed  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we began dosing patients in a phase i clinical trial of ana in february and the investigators at our clinical sites continue to recruit cancer patients to participate in the trial 
our future development activities for ana in oncology depend upon us enrolling a sufficient number of patients in this phase i clinical trial 
development activities could be delayed if there is insufficient patient enrollment in this phase i trial  which is a function of many factors  including the size and nature of the patient population  the nature of the protocol  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the number of other products under development competing for the same patients in trials and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial 
the eligibility criteria for clinical trials in patients with advanced solid tumors is somewhat limiting 
furthermore  there is no guarantee that the institutions and investigators conducting the clinical trials will devote adequate time and resources to our trials  perform as contractually required or meet our desired timeline 
we have recently completed dosing in a phase clinical trial of ana for hcv in the netherlands and are in the process of determining the next steps for the program 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to efficiently pursue the development of ana as a treatment for hcv 
we have recently completed dosing in a phase clinical trial of ana for hcv that was designed to test ana first in healthy volunteers and subsequently in hcv infected patients 
in the patient portion of this study we did not see evidence of immune stimulation or viral load reduction until the highest dose tested to date  the mg dose 
at the mg dose level  initial indications of immune induction and viral load decrease were seen in three of the five patients who received ana for whom we have data 
we are in the process of analyzing this data and are considering the possibility of exploring a higher dose level  however  there is no guarantee that we will choose to continue our development of ana for hcv 
if we decide to continue the study we will need to seek regulatory and ethics committee approval to amend the protocol for the study 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so or that the clinical investigators who are conducting the study will desire to participate in an extension of the study 
if we decide to and are able to continue the study  there is no guarantee that the dose levels required to induce the level of immune stimulation required to have an antiviral effect will be tolerable over time 
also  there is no guarantee that the magnitude of immune stimulation that we believe will confer therapeutic benefit will sufficiently reduce viral load 
if the hcv trial is stopped due to safety or tolerability issues  or if the tested doses fail to sufficiently reduce viral load  our business and stock price could suffer 
also  if we are unable to achieve viral load reduction at levels comparable to injectable interferon but with a cleaner side effect profile  the prospects for developing ana as a competitive hcv product will be diminished 
furthermore  the phase i clinical trial is being conducted in the netherlands and not under a us ind 
if  in the future  we want to proceed with the development of ana for hcv in the united states  we will need to obtain the approval of the fda under a us ind 
there is no guarantee that the fda will agree that ana should be tested as an investigational treatment for hcv 
currently there is no evidence that a tlr agonist can confer long term benefit as a therapy for hcv at an acceptable safety risk  and there is no guarantee that the fda will view the data from our phase i study in the netherlands as sufficiently compelling to allow clinical investigation  even if we view the data positively 
if the fda does not view the data from our phase i study in the netherlands as sufficiently compelling  it may not allow studies under a us ind  in which case we would be precluded from pursuing the development and commercialization of ana for hcv in the united states 
even if the fda allows the investigation of ana as a treatment for hcv in the united states  there is no guarantee that the fda will agree with our proposed clinical development plan  which could result in a delay of future clinical development in the united states and harm the value of the program 

table of contents our securities available for sale held in the form of marketable securities are subject to market  interest and credit risk that may reduce their value a portion of our securities available for sale is invested in marketable securities 
our cash position may be adversely affected by changes in the value of these securities 
in particular  the value of these holdings may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates  downgrades by rating agencies on the issuers of corporate bonds included in the portfolio and by other factors which may result in other than temporary declines in value of the investments 
each of these events may cause us to record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio and may adversely affect our cash position 
delays in the commencement of clinical testing of our current and potential product candidates could result in increased costs to us and delay our ability to generate revenues 
our potential drug products will require additional nonclinical testing and extensive clinical trials prior to submission of any regulatory application for commercial sales 
previously  we have conducted only early stage clinical trials on our own 
as a result  we have very limited experience conducting clinical trials 
in part because of this limited experience  we cannot be certain that planned clinical trials will begin or be completed on time  if at all 
delays in the commencement of clinical testing could significantly increase our product development costs and delay product commercialization 
in addition  many of the factors that may cause  or lead to  a delay in the commencement of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate 
the commencement of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons  including delays in demonstrating sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial  reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations and trial sites  manufacturing sufficient quantities or producing drug meeting our quality standards of a product candidate  obtaining approval of an ind application or proposed trial design from the fda  and obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site 
in addition  the commencement of clinical trials may be delayed due to insufficient patient enrollment  which is a function of many factors  including the size and nature of the patient population  the nature of the protocol  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease  the number of other products under development competing for the same patients in trials and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial 
delays in the completion of  or the termination of  clinical testing of our current and potential product candidates could result in increased costs to us and delay or prevent us from generating revenues 
once a clinical trial has begun  it may be delayed  suspended or terminated by us  potential future collaborators  the fda  or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors  including ongoing discussions with the fda or other regulatory authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials  failure to conduct clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements  lower than anticipated enrollment or retention rate of patients in clinical trials  inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the fda or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold  lack of adequate funding to continue clinical trials  negative results of clinical trials  
table of contents negative or potentially problematic results of ongoing and concurrent non clinical toxicology studies  requests by the fda for supplemental information on  or clarification of  the results of clinical trials conducted in other countries  insufficient supply or deficient quality of drug candidates or other materials necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials  or serious adverse events or other undesirable drug related side effects experienced by participants 
many of the factors that may lead to a delay  suspension or termination of clinical testing of a current or potential product candidate may also ultimately lead to denial of regulatory approval of a current or potential product candidate 
if we experience delays in the completion of  or termination of  clinical testing  our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed  and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed 
we will need additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed  which would force us to delay  reduce or eliminate our development programs 
our december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance was million 
we believe that this balance will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated operational cash needs for at least the next months 
however  we will need to seek additional funding within this period of time in order to initiate phase ii studies 
there is no guarantee that additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs 
in addition  we will need to raise additional capital to  among other things fund our development programs  acquire rights to products or product candidates  technologies or businesses  establish and maintain manufacturing  sales and marketing operations  and commercialize our product candidates  if any  that receive regulatory approval 
our future funding requirements will depend on  and could increase significantly as a result of many factors  including the progress of our clinical trials  the progress of our nonclinical development activities  our ability to establish and maintain strategic alliances  the costs involved in enforcing or defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the pace and timing of development activities conducted under joint development arrangements we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of establishing or expanding manufacturing  sales and distribution capabilities  the costs related to development and manufacture of pre clinical  clinical and validation lots for regulatory and commercialization of drug supply  the success of the commercialization of ana  ana and any additional products  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products technologies and businesses 

table of contents we do not anticipate that we will generate significant continuing revenues for at least several years  if ever 
until we can generate significant continuing revenues  we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  strategic alliances and licensing arrangements  project financing and grant funding  as well as through interest income earned on cash balances 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts 
if our efforts to obtain rights to new products or product candidates from third parties do not yield product candidates for clinical development or are not otherwise successful  we may not generate product revenues or achieve profitability 
our long term ability to earn product revenue depends in part on our ability to identify and obtain new products or product candidates through licenses from third parties 
if our internal development programs that are focused on the development of small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of hcv and cancer fail  we will need to obtain rights to new products or product candidates from third parties 
we may be unable to obtain suitable product candidates or products from third parties for a number of reasons  including we may be unable to purchase or license products or product candidates on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return from resulting products  competitors may be unwilling to assign or license product or product candidate rights to us  or we may be unable to identify suitable products or product candidates 
if we are unable to obtain rights to new products or product candidates from third parties  our ability to generate product revenues and achieve profitability may suffer 
even if we successfully complete clinical trials of ana  ana or any future product candidate  there are no assurances that we will be able to submit  or obtain fda approval of  a new drug application 
there can be no assurance that if our clinical trials of ana  ana or any other potential product candidate are successfully completed  we will be able to submit a new drug application  or nda  to the fda or that any nda we submit will be approved by the fda in a timely manner  if at all 
if we are unable to submit a nda with respect to ana  ana or any future product candidate  or if any nda we submit is not approved by the fda  we will be unable to commercialize that product in the us the fda can and does reject ndas and may require additional clinical trials  even when drug candidates performed well or achieved favorable results in large scale phase iii clinical trials 
if we fail to commercialize ana  ana or any future product candidate  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to attain profitability  and our reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be damaged  each of which would cause our stock price to decrease 
if we successfully develop products but those products do not achieve and maintain market acceptance  our business will not be profitable 
even if ana  ana or any future product candidates are approved for commercial sale by the fda or other regulatory authorities  the degree of market acceptance of any approved product candidate by physicians  healthcare professionals and third party payors and our profitability and growth will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy  relative convenience and ease of administration  the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects  availability of alternative treatments  
table of contents pricing and cost effectiveness  effectiveness of our or our collaborators sales and marketing strategy  our ability to obtain sufficient third party insurance coverage or reimbursement  and our ability to establish or maintain an attractive price for ana when used in combination with other agents 
if ana does not provide additional clinical benefit when included within a treatment regimen  that product likely will not be accepted favorably by the market 
similarly  if ana does not provide additional clinical benefit when included within a treatment regimen  that product will likewise not be accepted favorably by the market 
if any products we or our collaborators may develop do not achieve market acceptance  then we will not generate sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability 
in addition  even if our products achieve market acceptance  we may not be able to maintain that market acceptance over time if new products or technologies are introduced that are more favorably received than our products  are more cost effective or render our products obsolete  or complications  such as long term toxicities and viral resistance  arise with respect to use of our products 
we depend on outside parties to conduct our clinical trials  which may result in costs and delays that prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval or successfully commercializing product candidates 
we engage clinical investigators and medical institutions to enroll patients in planned clinical trials and contract research organizations to perform data collection and analysis and other aspects of our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
as a result  we depend on these clinical investigators  medical institutions and contract research organizations to properly perform the studies and trials 
if these parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines  or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons  our clinical trials may be extended  delayed or terminated 
we may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without undue delays or excessive expenditures 
if there are delays in testing or regulatory approvals as a result of the failure to perform by third parties  our drug development costs will increase and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain any of these existing relationships  or establish new ones on acceptable terms  if at all 
we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities  and if we fail to develop and maintain supply relationships with future collaborators or other outside manufacturers  we may be unable to develop or commercialize any of our products 
our ability to develop and commercialize products will depend in part on our ability to manufacture  or arrange for collaborators or other parties to manufacture  our products at a competitive cost  in accordance with regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities for clinical testing and eventual commercialization 
our current manufacturing agreements reflect a much smaller scale than would be required for commercialization 
if we are unable to enter into or maintain commercial scale manufacturing agreements with future collaborators or capable contract manufacturers on acceptable terms the development and commercialization of our products could be delayed  which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and would increase our expenses 
if we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market any products we may develop  we may not be able to generate product revenue 
we do not currently have the capabilities for the sales  marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
in order to commercialize any products  we must build our sales  marketing  distribution  managerial and other non technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services 
the establishment and development of our own sales force to market any products we may develop in the us will be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch  and we cannot be certain that we would be able to successfully develop this capacity 
if we are unable to establish our sales and marketing capability or any other non technical capabilities necessary to commercialize any product we may develop  we will need to contract with third parties to market and sell any products we may develop in the us we will also need to develop a plan to market and sell any products we may develop outside the us if we are unable to establish adequate sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  whether independently or with third parties  we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable 

table of contents if we are unable to attract and retain key management and scientific staff  we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates 
we are a small company  with approximately employees  and our success depends on our continued ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified management and scientific personnel 
in particular  our programs depend on our ability to retain highly skilled chemists  biologists  and preclinical and clinical personnel in the fields of hcv and oncology 
we may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology and pharmaceutical businesses  particularly in the san diego  california area 
if we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives  we may experience constraints that will impede significantly the achievement of our development objectives 
in addition  all of our employees are at will employees  which means that any employee may quit at any time and we may terminate any employee at any time 
currently we do not have employment agreements with any employees or members of senior management that provide any guarantee of continued employment by us 
we do not currently carry key person insurance covering members of senior management other than steve worland  phd  our president and chief executive officer 
the insurance covering dr 
worland is in the amount of million 
if we lose the services of dr 
worland  james t 
glover  our senior vice president  operations and chief financial officer  james l 
freddo  md  our senior vice president  drug development and chief medical officer  or other members of our senior management team or key personnel  we may not be able to find suitable replacements  and our business may be harmed as a result 
our quarterly results and stock price may fluctuate significantly 
we expect our results of operations to be subject to quarterly fluctuations 
the level of our revenues  if any  and results of operations at any given time  will be based primarily on the following factors the status of development of ana  ana and our other product candidates  including results of preclinical studies and clinical trials and changes in regulatory status  our execution of collaborative  licensing or other arrangements  and the timing and accounting treatment of payments we make or receive under these arrangements  whether or not we achieve specified research or commercialization milestones under any agreement that we enter into with collaborators and the timely payment by commercial collaborators of any amounts payable to us  variations in the level of expenses related to our product candidates or potential product candidates during any given period  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
these factors  some of which are not within our control  may cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially 
in particular  if our quarterly operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly 
in addition  fluctuations in the stock prices of other companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries and in the financial markets generally may affect our stock price 
we believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
if we engage in any acquisition  we will incur a variety of costs  and we may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
we may attempt to acquire businesses  technologies  services or products or in license technologies that we believe are a strategic fit with our business  at the appropriate time and as resources permit 
we believe that strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses  technologies  services or products are a material component of our business strategy to provide us with access to new compounds that are potentially synergistic with our existing product candidate portfolio 
if we undertake any acquisition  the process of integrating the acquired business  technology  service or product may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert significant management attention from our ongoing business operations 
these operational and financial risks include exposure to unknown liabilities  
table of contents disruption of our business and diversion of our management s time and attention to acquiring and developing acquired products or technologies  incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of securities to pay for acquisitions  higher than expected acquisition and integration costs  increased amortization expenses  negative effect on our earnings or loss per share  difficulty and cost in combining and integrating the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel  impairment of relationships with key suppliers  contractors or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership  and inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses 
we have limited experience in identifying acquisition targets  successfully completing potential acquisitions and integrating any acquired businesses  technologies  services or products into our current infrastructure 
moreover  we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or devote resources to potential acquisitions that are never completed 
if we fail to successfully identify strategic opportunities  complete strategic transactions or integrate acquired businesses  technologies  services or products  we may not be able to successfully expand our product candidate portfolio to provide adequate revenue to attain and maintain profitability 
earthquake or wildfire damage to our facilities could delay our research and development efforts and adversely affect our business 
our headquarters and research and development facilities in san diego  california  are located in a seismic zone  and there is the possibility of an earthquake  which could be disruptive to our operations and result in delays in our research and development efforts 
in addition  san diego has experienced several severe wildfires during the past several years which have destroyed or damaged many businesses and residences in the san diego area 
in the event of an earthquake or a severe wildfire  if our facilities or the equipment in our facilities are significantly damaged or destroyed for any reason  or we are otherwise required to shut down our operations  we may not be able to rebuild or relocate our facility or replace any damaged equipment  or otherwise recommence our business operations  in a timely manner and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to our industry because our product candidates and development and collaboration efforts depend on our intellectual property rights  adverse events affecting our intellectual property rights will harm our ability to commercialize products 
our commercial success depends on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our product candidates  proprietary technologies and their uses  as well as successfully defending these patents against third party challenges 
we will only be able to protect our product candidates  proprietary technologies and their uses from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents or effectively protected trade secrets cover them 
due to evolving legal standards relating to the patentability  validity and enforceability of patents covering pharmaceutical inventions and the scope of claims made under these patents  our ability to obtain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
accordingly  rights under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection for ana or ana or provide sufficient protection to afford us a commercial advantage against competitive products or processes 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that any patents will issue from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us 
even with respect to patents that have issued or will issue  we cannot guarantee that the claims of these patents are  or will be valid  enforceable or will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable to us 
for example we might not have been the first to make  conceive  or reduce to practice the inventions covered by all or any of our pending patent applications and issued patents  
table of contents we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions  others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies  it is possible that none of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents  our issued or acquired patents may not provide a basis for commercially viable products  may not provide us with any competitive advantages  or may be challenged by third parties  our issued patents may not be valid or enforceable  we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  or the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business 
patent applications in the us are maintained in confidence for up to months or longer after their filing 
consequently  we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent  or the first to file patent applications on our product candidates 
in the event that a third party has also filed a us patent application relating to our product candidates or a similar invention  we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the us patent office to determine priority of invention in the us the costs of these proceedings could be substantial and it is possible that our efforts would be unsuccessful  resulting in a material adverse effect on our us patent position 
furthermore  we may not have identified all us and foreign patents or published applications that affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our drugs or by covering similar technologies that affect our drug market 
in addition  some countries  including many in europe  do not grant patent claims directed to methods of treating humans  and in these countries patent protection may not be available at all to protect our drug candidates 
even if patents issue  we cannot guarantee that the claims of those patents will be valid and enforceable or provide us with any significant protection against competitive products  or otherwise be commercially valuable to us 
we may be particularly affected by this because we expect that ana  if approved  will be marketed in foreign countries with high incidences of hcv infection 
other companies may obtain patents and or regulatory approvals to use the same drugs to treat diseases other than hcv or cancer 
as a result  we may not be able to enforce our patents effectively because we may not be able to prevent healthcare providers from prescribing  administering or using another company s product that contains the same active substance as our products when treating patients infected with hcv or who have cancer 
if we fail to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection of ana or ana  proprietary technologies and their uses  the competition we face would increase  reducing our potential revenues and adversely affecting our ability to attain or maintain profitability 
if we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of others  it will be costly and time consuming  and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our commercial success also depends upon our ability to develop  manufacture  market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our product candidates  technologies or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
numerous us and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others exist in hcv and cancer 
these could materially affect our ability to develop our drug candidates or sell our products 
because patent applications can take many years to issue  there may be currently pending applications  unknown to us  which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or technologies may infringe 
there also may be existing patents  of which we are not aware  that our product candidates or technologies may inadvertently infringe 
further  there may be issued patents and pending patent applications in fields relevant to our business  of which we may become aware from time to time  that we believe we do not infringe or that we believe are invalid or relate to immaterial portions of our overall drug discovery and development efforts 
we cannot assure you that third parties holding any of 
table of contents these patents or patent applications will not assert infringement claims against us for damages or seeking to enjoin our activities 
we also cannot assure you that  in the event of litigation  we will be able to successfully assert any belief we may have as to non infringement  invalidity or immateriality  or that any infringement claims will be resolved in our favor 
there is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries generally 
any litigation or claims against us  with or without merit  may cause us to incur substantial costs  could place a significant strain on our financial resources  divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation 
in addition  intellectual property litigation or claims could result in substantial damages and force us to do one or more of the following if a court decides that we infringe on another party s patent or other intellectual property rights cease selling  incorporating or using any of our product candidates or technologies that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right  which license may be costly or may not be available on reasonable terms  it at all  or redesign our processes or technologies so that they do not infringe  which could be costly and time consuming and may not be possible 
if we find during clinical evaluation that our drug candidates for the treatment of hcv or cancer should be used in combination with a product covered by a patent held by another company or institution  and that a labeling instruction is required in product packaging recommending that combination  we could be accused of  or held liable for  inducing infringement of the third party patents covering the product recommended for co administration with our product 
in that case  we may be required to obtain a license from the other company or institution to use the required or desired package labeling  which may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our technologies  we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our product candidates 
we may be involved in lawsuits or proceedings to protect or enforce our patent rights  trade secrets or know how  which could be expensive and time consuming 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming 
litigation and interference proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel 
further  the outcome of patent litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance  including the demeanor and credibility of witnesses and the identity of the adverse party 
this is especially true in biotechnology related patent cases that may turn on the testimony of experts as to technical facts upon which experts may reasonably disagree and which may be difficult to comprehend by a judge or jury 
an adverse determination in an interference proceeding or litigation with respect to ana or ana  to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
if required  the necessary licenses may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from commercializing ana or ana  which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of pre trial document and witness discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation 
in addition  during the course of this kind of litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could have a substantial adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property 
we also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology  especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
in order to protect our proprietary technology and processes  we also rely in part on confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our corporate partners  employees  consultants  outside 
table of contents scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers and other advisors 
these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information nor result in the effective assignment to us of intellectual property  and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or other breaches of the agreements 
in addition  others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information  and in such case we could not assert any trade secret rights against such party 
enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult  expensive and time consuming  and the outcome is unpredictable 
in addition  courts outside the us may be less willing to protect trade secrets 
costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to seek to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights  and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position 
many competitors have significantly more resources and experience  which may harm our commercial opportunity 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to intense competition and rapid and significant technological change 
we have many potential competitors  including major drug and chemical companies  specialized biotechnology firms  academic institutions  government agencies and private and public research institutions 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources  experience and expertise in research and development  preclinical testing  clinical trials  regulatory approvals  manufacturing  and sales and marketing of approved products 
smaller or early stage companies and research institutions may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established pharmaceutical or other companies 
we will also face competition from these parties in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel  establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials  and acquiring and in licensing technologies and products complementary to our programs or potentially advantageous to our business 
if any of our competitors succeed in obtaining approval from the fda or other regulatory authorities for their products sooner than we do or for products that are more effective or less costly than ours  our commercial opportunity could be significantly reduced 
if our competitors develop treatments for hcv or cancer that are approved faster  marketed better or demonstrated to be more effective than ana  ana  or any other products that we may develop  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated 
we believe that a significant number of drugs are currently under development and may become available in the future for the treatment of hcv and certain cancers 
potential competitors may develop treatments for hcv or certain cancers that are more effective or less costly than our product candidates or that would make our product candidates obsolete or non competitive 
some of these products may use therapeutic approaches that compete directly with ana or ana in addition  less expensive generic forms of currently marketed drugs could lead to additional competition upon patent expiration or invalidations 
ana  a non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor  was selected as a development candidate in june if approved  ana would likely be used in combination with the current standard of care and or other direct antiviral agents such as protease inhibitors and polymerase inhibitors 
any product currently approved or approved in the future for the treatment of hcv infection could decrease or eliminate the commercial opportunity of ana other non nucleoside inhibitors would likely be the most direct competitors for ana to our knowledge  non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor programs are currently under clinical evaluation by pfizer  gilead  merck  abbott  boeringer ingleheim and virochem 
further  a number of companies have non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor research and pre clinical development programs 
other potential competitors are products currently approved for the treatment of hcv infection peg intron pegylated interferon alpha b  rebetol ribavirin  and intron a interferon alpha b  which are marketed by schering plough  pegasys pegylated 
table of contents interferon alpha a  copegus ribavirin usp  and roferon a interferon alpha a  which are marketed by roche 
additional compounds in late state clinical trials for hcv include albuferon  in development by human genome sciences and novartis  telaprevir  in development by vertex pharmaceuticals and janssen pharmaceutica  boceprevir and sch  in development by schering plough  itmn  in development by intermune and roche  tmc  in development by tibotec and medivir  mk in development by merck  bi in development by boehringer ingelheim  and r in development by pharmasset and roche 
ana is a prodrug of a tlr agonist under evaluation for oncology and hepatitis c indications 
any product currently approved or approved in the future for the treatment of cancer could decrease or eliminate the commercial opportunity of ana in the oncology markets 
programs that most directly compete with the ana oncology program at this time are other tlr agonists under evaluation for oncology indications  imo  in development by idera and merck kgaa and a cancer program in development by dynavax 
ana is also subject to competition in the treatment of hcv from all of the hcv products and compounds in development listed above as potential competitors of ana and most specifically from the products and development candidates that act as an immunomodulator or have an immunomodulatory component  including peg intron pegylated interferon alpha b  rebetol ribavirin  intron a interferon alpha b  pegasys pegylated interferon alpha a  copegus ribavirin usp  and roferon a interferon alpha a  each of which are products currently approved for the treatment of hcv 
imo  a tlr agonist in development by idera  is also being studied in early stage clinical trials in hcv patients 
other agents in development as potential replacements to pegylated interferon alfa include albuerferon  in development by human genome sciences and novartis and locteron  in development by biolex therapeutics  both of which are longer acting versions of interferon alfa 
also  in development as potential improvements to existing interferons are peg interferon lambda  in development by zymogenetics and bristol myers squibb  and omega interferon in development by intarcia therapeutics 
if we cannot establish pricing of our product candidates acceptable to the government  insurance companies  managed care organizations and other payors  any product sales will be severely hindered 
the continuing efforts of the government  insurance companies  managed care organizations and other payors of health care costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may adversely affect our ability to set a price we believe is fair for any products we or our collaborators may develop  our ability to generate adequate revenues and gross margins  and the availability of capital 
in certain foreign markets  the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control 
in the us  given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care  the us congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform  the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the medicare and medicaid systems 
the trend toward managed health care in the us  which could significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products  as well as legislative proposals to reform health care  control pharmaceutical prices or reduce government insurance programs  may result in lower prices for our product candidates 
while we cannot predict whether any legislative or regulatory proposals affecting our business will be adopted  the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material and adverse effect on our potential revenues and gross margins 
if we cannot arrange for reimbursement policies favorable to our product candidates  their sales will be severely hindered 
our ability to commercialize ana  ana or any other product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities  private health insurers and other organizations establish appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of ana  ana or any other products and related treatments 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services  including treatments for hcv and cancer 
also  the trend toward managed health care in the us as well as legislative proposals to reform health care  control pharmaceutical prices or reduce government insurance programs  may also result in exclusion of our product candidates from reimbursement programs 
the cost containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform could materially and adversely affect our ability to earn product revenue and generate significant profits and could impact our ability to raise capital 

table of contents product liability claims may damage our reputation and  if insurance proves inadequate  the product liability claims may harm our results of operations 
we face an inherent risk of product liability exposure for claimed injuries related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials  and will face an even greater risk if we or our collaborators sell our product candidates commercially 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we will incur substantial liabilities 
regardless of merit or eventual outcome  product liability claims may result in decreased demand for our product candidates  injury to our reputation  withdrawal of clinical trial participants  the inability to establish new collaborations with potential collaborators  substantial costs of related litigation  substantial monetary awards to patients  and the inability to commercialize our product candidates 
we currently have product liability insurance that covers our clinical trials and plan to increase and expand this coverage as we commence larger scale trials 
we also intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if marketing approval is obtained for any of our product candidates 
however  insurance coverage is increasingly expensive 
we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost and we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise 
any claims relating to our improper handling  storage or disposal of biological  hazardous and radioactive materials could be time consuming and costly 
our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials  including chemicals that cause cancer  volatile solvents  including ethylacetate and acetonitrile  radioactive materials and biological materials including plasma from patients infected with hcv or other infectious diseases that have the potential to transmit disease 
our operations also produce hazardous waste products 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and waste products 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or with the conditions attached to our operating licenses  the licenses could be revoked  and we could be subjected to criminal sanctions and substantial liability or required to suspend or modify our operations 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of contamination or injury  we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources  and our clinical trials could be suspended 
in addition  we may have to incur significant costs to comply with future environmental laws and regulations 
we do not currently have a pollution and remediation insurance policy 
our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures 
despite the implementation of security measures  our internal computer systems are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses  unauthorized access  natural disasters  terrorism  war and telecommunication and electrical failures 
any system failure  accident or security breach that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption of our drug discovery programs 
to the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or applications  or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information  we may incur liability as a result  our drug discovery programs may be adversely affected and the further development of our product candidates may be delayed 
in addition  we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches 

table of contents risks related to our common stock future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline 
our current stockholders hold a substantial number of shares of our common stock that they are able to sell in the public market 
significant portions of these shares are held by a small number of stockholders 
sales by our current stockholders of a substantial number of shares or the expectation that such sale may occur  could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  most of which we cannot control  including changes in the regulatory status of our product candidates  including the status and results of our clinical trials of ana and ana  significant contracts  new technologies  acquisitions  commercial relationships  joint ventures or capital commitments  disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights  including patents  trade secrets  litigation matters  and our ability to patent or otherwise protect our product candidates and technologies  conditions or trends in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  fluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies or of the markets generally  variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance  failure to meet or exceed securities analysts or investors expectations of our quarterly financial results  clinical results or our achievement of milestones  sales of large blocks of our common stock  or the expectation that such sales may occur  including sales by our executive officers  directors and significant stockholders  additions or departures of key personnel  discussion of our business  products  financial performance  prospects or our stock price by the financial and scientific press and online investor communities such as chat rooms  regulatory developments in the us and foreign countries  economic and political factors  including wars  terrorism and political unrest  and technological advances by our competitors 
our largest stockholders may take actions that are contrary to your interests  including selling their stock 
a small number of our stockholders hold a significant amount of our outstanding stock 
these stockholders may support competing transactions and have interests that are different from yours 
in addition  the average number of shares of our stock that trade each day is generally low 
as a result  sales of a large number of shares of our stock by these large stockholders or other stockholders within a short period of time could adversely affect our stock price 
anti takeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders  which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

table of contents our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control  discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 
these provisions include dividing our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three year terms  prohibiting our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders  permitting the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock without stockholder approval  prohibiting our stockholders from making certain changes to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws except with stockholder approval  and requiring advance notice for raising matters of business or making nominations at stockholders meetings 
we are also subject to provisions of the delaware corporation law that  in general  prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of or more of our common stock for five years unless the holder s acquisition of our stock was approved in advance by our board of directors 
although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
in addition  these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors  which is responsible for appointing the members of our management

overview anadys pharmaceuticals  inc is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving patient care by developing novel medicines in the areas of hepatitis c and oncology 
for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c virus hcv  we are developing ana  a small molecule  non nucleoside inhibitor of the nsb polymerase  and ana  an oral  small molecule toll like receptor tlr agonist prodrug 
we are also developing ana for the treatment of cancer 
in the second quarter of  we commenced dosing in a phase i single  ascending dose clinical trial of ana in healthy volunteers to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of the agent 
in late september  we announced preliminary results of the phase i clinical trial of ana in healthy volunteers and the finalization of the protocol for a phase ib trial of ana in hcv infected patients 
dosing began in the phase ib clinical trial during the fourth quarter of during the first quarter of we announced results from the first dose level of the phase ib clinical trial 
eleven patients at the first dose level received mg twice daily for three days 
at the end of the treatment period the median viral load decline in the eleven patients who received mg of ana twice daily was log we expect to report the full set of data from this study during the second quarter of in july  we announced the expansion of our development efforts in hcv to include clinical investigation of ana as an approach to treating hepatitis c  the tlr mechanism is independent from  and potentially complementary to ana in july  we initiated dosing in the healthy volunteer portion of a phase i clinical trial of ana for the treatment of hcv 
this portion of the trial was designed to assess the safety  pharmacokinetics and immunological activity of ana in october  we completed dosing in healthy volunteers 
dosing began in hcv infected patients during the fourth quarter of the primary objectives of the patient portion of the study are to assess safety  tolerability and viral load decline in hcv patients 
to date  we have received data from the mg and mg cohorts and from seven out of the eight patients in the mg cohort 
at the mg and mg dose levels minimal immune induction and no significant viral load decrease was noted 
at the mg dose level  initial indications of immune induction and viral load decrease were seen in three of the five patients who have received ana for whom we have data 
we are in the process of analyzing this data and are considering the possibility of exploring a higher dose level 
this phase i trial is being conducted in the netherlands 
in february  patient dosing commenced in a phase i clinical trial of ana in cancer patients in the united states 
this first in human trial is a safety and tolerability study designed to identify pharmacologically active doses and preliminary anti tumor activity as well as to select the dose and schedule for potential phase ii trials 
we continue to enroll patients and explore the safety and tolerability profile of ana in the ongoing phase i trial  and expect to identify a pharmacologically active dose and establish the profile of immune stimulation in the first half of  which information is intended to support the future design of clinical trials of ana alone or in combinations in specific tumor types 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and  as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to incur substantial losses for at least the next several years as we continue the development of ana for the treatment of hcv  
table of contents continue the development of ana for the treatment of hcv  continue the development of ana for the treatment of cancer  develop methods for and scale up manufacturing of ana and ana for clinical trials and potential commercialization  commercialize any product candidates that receive regulatory approval  and potentially in license technology and acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that are synergistic with our own 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the discovery  preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates 
in addition  research and development expenses may include external costs such as fees paid to clinical research organizations  clinical trial investigators  contract research organizations  drug substance and drug product manufacturers and consultants 
research and development expenses may also include internal costs such as compensation  supplies  materials  an allocated portion of facilities costs  an allocated portion of information systems support personnel and depreciation 
under our former license and co development agreement with novartis international pharmaceutical ltd 
novartis  reimbursements of development costs for ana from novartis were recorded as an offset to research and development expense 
for the years ended december   and  we have recorded as offsets to research and development expense million  million and million  respectively 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for commercialization 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
however  we expect our research and development costs to be substantial and to increase as we advance our product candidates through clinical development 
the following summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and in thousands for the years ended december  ana ana ana ana  net of reimbursement discovery stage programs infrastructure and support personnel severance related to reduction in force non cash employee and non employee share based compensation total research and development expense effective july   we began allocating costs for ana between our hcv and oncology programs 
for the six months ended december   ana hcv related costs were million and ana oncology related costs were million 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for executive  finance  investor relations  business development  human resources and legal personnel 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include insurance costs  professional services and an allocated portion of facilities costs and information systems support personnel 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis and make adjustments to the consolidated financials statements as considered necessary 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while all of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we believe the following accounting policies involve the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements drug development costs 
drug development costs include costs associated with the development of our product candidates including non clinical activities  toxicology studies  manufacturing of non clinical and clinical materials and clinical trials 
we review and accrue drug development costs based on work performed 
we estimate work performed utilizing factors such as subject enrollment  estimated timeline for completion of studies and other factors 
these costs and estimates vary based on the type  scope and length of non clinical and clinical studies as well as other factors 
drug development cost accruals are subject to revisions as studies  projects and trials progress to completion 
expense is adjusted for revisions in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
share based compensation 
we account for share based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by a black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense evenly over the requisite service period 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the risk free interest rate and the expected term of the awards 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
revenue recognition 
we may receive payments from collaborators for compound licenses  technology access fees  option fees  research services  milestones and royalty obligations 
these payments are recognized as revenue or reported as deferred revenue until they meet the criteria for revenue recognition as outlined in staff accounting bulletin  no 
 revenue recognition  which provides guidance on revenue recognition in financial statements  and is based on the interpretations and practices developed by the sec  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services were rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and the collectability is reasonably assured 
specifically  we have applied the following policies in recognizing revenue revenue from milestones is recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgment from the collaborator or other persuasive evidence that the milestone has been achieved  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by the collaborator at the comparable level and iii the milestone is not refundable or creditable 
if all of these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement 
upfront fees under our collaborations  such as technology access fees  are recognized over the period the related services are provided 
non refundable upfront fees not associated with our future performance are recognized when received 
fees that we receive for research services are generally recognized as the services are provided  as long as the amounts received are not refundable regardless of the results of the research project 
pending adoption of recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on eitf issue no

results of operations comparison of the years ended december   and revenue 
during  we did not recognize any revenue 
we recorded revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase from to was primarily attributed to the recognition of previously deferred revenue upon the termination of our license and co development agreement with novartis 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million decrease from to was primarily due to cost savings derived from our completed strategic restructuring which included the halting of early stage discovery efforts and the termination of our collaborations with both novartis and lg life sciences 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in development costs for ana and ana we incurred development costs associated with our ana program related to our completed phase ia clinical trial in healthy volunteers  our on going phase ib clinical trial in patients  the initiation of long term chronic toxicology studies of ana and the manufacturing of clinical and non clinical materials 
development costs for ana include costs associated with the manufacturing of non clinical and clinical materials  our completed week glp toxicology studies  our on going phase i clinical trial for hcv and our on going phase i clinical trial for oncology 
our non cash share based compensation expense associated with share based payments granted to our research and development employees was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in our non cash share based compensation expense was primarily associated with the cancellation of outstanding stock options for personnel involved in our completed strategic restructuring as well as a reduction in the weighted average fair value assigned to stock options granted in compared to both and the million increase from to was primarily due to an increase in external preclinical development costs for ana and ana the increase was partially offset by a decrease in development costs associated with ana and cost savings associated with our restructuring effected during  including the halting of early stage discovery efforts 
included in research and development expense for the year ended december   is million of severance related costs associated with our restructuring 
our non cash share based compensation expense associated with share based payments granted to our research and development employees was million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million decrease from to was primarily the result of cost savings derived from our completed strategic restructuring 
non cash share based compensation expense associated with share based payments granted to our general and administrative employees and non employee directors for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the million decrease from to was primarily attributable to a decrease in share based compensation from to  partially offset by an increase in costs associated with our restructuring and other severance related costs 
the higher share based compensation expense during was largely driven by the acceleration of the unvested stock options held by kleanthis g 
xanthopoulos  phd our former president and chief executive officer and current member of our board of directors upon his resignation as president and chief executive officer 
non cash share based compensation expense associated with share based payments granted to our general and administrative employees and non employee directors for the year ended december  was 
table of contents million  which included million of stock based compensation associated with the acceleration of dr 
xanthopoulos stock unvested stock options 
interest income 
interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million decrease in our interest income from to was the result of a lower average cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale balance and lower interest rates during compared to our average balance of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale  which were invested in interest bearing securities  was million in compared to million in the decrease in our average cash balance from to was driven by our use of cash  cash equivalents and securities to fund our on going operations 
the million decrease in our interest income from to was the result of a lower average cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale balance during compared to our average balance of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale  which were invested in interest bearing securities  was million in compared to million in the decrease in our average cash balance from to was driven by our use of cash  cash equivalents and securities to fund our on going operations 
liquidity and capital resources overview our december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance was million 
our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities decreased by million from december  to december  which represents the use of our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale to fund our operations during the year ended december  in order to conduct phase ii clinical trials of ana and or ana for the treatment of hcv or a phase ii clinical trial of ana for the treatment of cancer  we will need to seek additional financing which could be completed through a number of financing vehicles including the sale of equity securities  new strategic alliance agreements or other transactions  project financing or debt financing 
however  we may not be successful in obtaining strategic alliance or other agreements  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements 
in addition  we cannot be sure that additional debt or equity financing will be available when needed or that  if available  such financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
as a result  if we are not able to obtain additional financing during the second half of  we will postpone  reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our development programs 
with these reductions in expenditures  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements through december  future cash requirements we expect our development expenses to be substantial and to increase as we continue the advancement of our development programs 
the lengthy process of completing clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval for our product candidates requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us or delay in completing clinical trials  or in obtaining regulatory approvals  could cause our research and development expenses to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the progress of our nonclinical development activities  the progress of our clinical trials  our ability to establish and maintain strategic alliances the costs involved in enforcing or defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of establishing or expanding manufacturing  sales and distribution capabilities  
table of contents the costs related to development and manufacture of pre clinical  clinical and validation lots for regulatory and commercialization of drug supply  the success of the commercialization of ana  ana or any other product candidates we may develop  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products  technologies and businesses 
investment portfolio as of december   we have million of marketable securities consisting of money market funds  commercial paper  us government sponsored enterprise securities and corporate debt securities with maturities that range from day to months with an overall average months to maturity of months 
we have the ability to liquidate these marketable securities without restriction 
included in our portfolio of securities available for sale as of december   is an american general finance corporation  a subsidiary of american international group  inc aig  corporate bond that matures on august  as of december   the face value of the security is million and the current market value is million  which resulted in a million unrealized loss that is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
as of december   we performed a review of all of the securities in our portfolio with an unrealized loss position  including the american general finance corporation corporate bond  to determine if any other than temporary impairments were required to be recorded 
factors considered in our assessment included but were not limited to the following our ability and intent to hold the security until maturity  the number of months until the security s maturity  the number of quarters that each security was in an unrealized loss position  ratings assigned to each security by independent rating agencies  the magnitude of the unrealized loss compared to the face value of the security and other market conditions 
no other than temporary impairments were identified as of december  related to securities currently in our portfolio 
we also noted that none of the securities as of december  have been in an unrealized loss position for greater than one year

cash flows from operating activities and investing activities our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows in thousands for the years ended december  net cash used in operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities purchase of securities available for sale proceeds from sale of securities available for sale purchase of property and equipment proceeds from disposal of property and equipment net cash provided by used in investing activities cash flows used in operating activities increased by million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  we expect to continue to utilize cash and marketable securities to fund our operating activities as we continue to advance our wholly owned product candidates ana and ana we are not currently party to any development collaborations and therefore cash to fund future operations will most likely have to be obtained from one of the following sources our current investment portfolio  the sale of other equity securities  new strategic alliance agreements or other transactions project financing or debt financing 
cash flows provided by used in investing activities increased by million from the year ended december  to december  the overall increase in the cash flows provided by investing activities is primarily related to the timing of the purchases and maturities of our marketable securities 
in addition  proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment increased million from to cash flows used in investing activities decreased by million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the overall reduction in the cash flows used in investing activities from to is primarily related to the use of the proceeds from the sale of securities available for sale used to fund our operations during 
table of contents cash flows from financing activities our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows in thousands for the years ended december  cash provided by used in financing activities proceeds from exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan principal payments on long term debt net cash provided by used in financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities were fairly consistent from the year ended december  to the year ended december  cash flows provided by financing activities increased by million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of the outstanding principal due under the loan and security agreements being paid in full during february aggregate contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands less than to to contractual obligations total year thereafter operating leases minimum royalty commitment we also enter into agreements with clinical sites and contract research organizations that conduct our clinical trials 
we generally make payments to these entities based upon the number of subjects enrolled and the length of their participation in the trials 
to date  the majority of our clinical costs have been related to the costs of subjects entering our clinical trials as well as the manufacturing of compounds to be used in our clinical trials 
costs associated with clinical trials will continue to vary as the trials go through their natural phases of enrollment and follow up 
the costs will also be influenced by the pace of the development activities  timing of the development activities and regulatory requirements associated with the conduct of our clinical trials 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the total costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for potential commercialization 
due to these same factors  we are unable to determine the anticipated completion dates for our current product development programs 
clinical development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
as we continue our development programs  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as an ongoing assessment of the product candidate s commercial potential 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of our product candidates will be subject to future partnering  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
as a result  we cannot be certain when  or if  and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of our product candidates 
fair value inputs we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
as of january  see note and note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
fair value is a market based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset 
we value our marketable securities by using quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
the types of securities valued based on quoted market prices in active markets include money market securities 
we do not adjust the quoted price for such securities 
the types of instruments valued based on quoted prices in markets that are not active  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency include commercial paper  us government sponsored enterprise securities and corporate debt securities 
the price for each security at the measurement date is sourced from an independent pricing vendor 
periodically  management assesses the reasonableness of these sourced prices by comparing them to the prices provided by our portfolio managers to derive the fair value of these financial instruments 
historically  we did not experience significant deviation between the prices from the independent pricing vendor and our 
table of contents portfolio managers 
management assesses the inputs of the pricing in order to categorize the financial instruments into the appropriate hierarchy levels 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments
