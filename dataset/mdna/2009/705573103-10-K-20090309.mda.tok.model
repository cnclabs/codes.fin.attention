item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our products and services we develop and license rules based bpm software and provide professional services  maintenance  and training related to our software 
we focus our sales efforts on target accounts  which are companies or divisions within companies  and are typically large organizations that are among the leaders in their industry 
our strategy is to sell initial licenses to these target accounts that are focused on a specific purpose or area of operations  rather than selling large enterprise licenses 
this strategy allows our customers to quickly realize business value from our software and limits their initial investment 
once a customer has realized this initial value  we work with the customer to identify opportunities for follow on sales 
our license revenue is primarily derived from sales of our pegarules process commander prpc software and related solution frameworks 
prpc is a comprehensive platform for building and managing bpm applications that unifies business rules and business processes 
our solution frameworks are built on the capabilities of prpc and are purpose or industry specific collections of best practice functionality to allow organizations to quickly implement new customer facing practices and processes  bring new offerings to market  and provide customized or specialized processing 
these products often require less implementation assistance than prior generations of our software products 
in many cases this has resulted in a shorter sales process and implementation period 
prpc and related solution frameworks can be used by a broad range of customers within financial services  insurance and healthcare markets  as well as other markets  such as life sciences and government 
our customers typically request professional services and training to assist them in implementing our products 
almost all of our customers also purchase maintenance on our products  which includes rights to upgrades and new releases  incident resolution and technical assistance 
professional services are provided directly by us and through our network of partners 
by utilizing these partners  we have increased the supply of skilled service consultants that can assist our customers 
business overview despite the current economic crisis  we achieved license revenue growth of in compared to  including a increase in term license revenue 
we generated approximately million in cash flows from operations in  which represents a increase compared to we generated the majority of our license revenue in from follow on sales to existing customers 
we believe these results reflect our ability to quickly and successfully deliver our versatile build for change technology to fortune customers across industries and international borders  allowing these customers to reduce operating costs and increase revenues within a rapid time frame from implementation 
these operational efficiencies experienced by our customers are part of the strong value proposition our technology provides to our customers

table of contents we believe that the ongoing challenges for our business include continuing to drive revenue growth despite the current economic crisis  continuing to expand our expertise in new and existing industries  and maintaining our leadership position in the bpm market 
to support our growth and successfully address these challenges through we plan to continue to develop and increase our solutions frameworks offerings and expertise across targeted industries  expand our professional services and partner organizations  continue to invest in our research and development efforts in india and the us  and continue to hire sales and marketing professionals 
the recent liquidity crisis in the global capital markets and the current economic crisis have had an adverse impact on market participants including  among other things  volatility in security prices  diminished liquidity  and limited access to funding 
these conditions could impact the ability and willingness of our financial services and insurance customers  and possibly our customers in other industries  to make investments in technology and pay their trade obligations 
our financial services and insurance customers as a group represent a significant amount of our revenues  including those associated with our non cancellable term licenses as detailed on page  and our receivables 
we considered these facts and determined they did not have a material impact on our allowances for doubtful accounts and sales credit memos as of december  as of december   our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaled million  a million increase compared to we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and our share repurchase program for at least the next months 
we also evaluate acquisition and other strategic opportunities from time to time  which if pursued  could require use of our funds 
material risks to cash flow from operations include delayed or reduced cash payments accompanying sales of new licenses or a decline in our services business 
results of operations our revenue is derived from software licenses  maintenance fees related to our software licenses  and professional services 
revenue from software licenses includes perpetual and term license revenue and subscription revenue 
as of january   we expanded the presentation of the services revenue and the associated cost of services lines in the consolidated statements of income to separately disclose the amounts related to maintenance and professional services 
maintenance revenue is a significant portion of our total revenue and is directly attributable to the installed base of our software licenses 
professional services revenue includes revenue from consulting services and training 
we believe separate disclosure of the maintenance revenue and the associated direct costs is meaningful to investors and provides an important measure of our business performance

table of contents the increase in our total revenue during compared to was attributable to an increase in the demand for our software products and related services due to growth in the bpm sector and our position as leader in this market space 
we believe the demand for our software solutions in the current economic crisis is primarily due to the strong value proposition and flexible licensing terms we offer our customers 
the increase in gross profit for compared to was due to the increase in both license and maintenance revenue despite a decrease in the professional services gross profit 
the increase in income before provision for income taxes during compared to was primarily due to our license and maintenance revenue growth 
these increases in revenue offset the higher expenses associated with our continued investment in expanding our sales and marketing personnel  professional services infrastructure  and research and development

fair value measurements sfas on january  see note recent accounting pronouncements and note cash  marketable securities  and fair value measurements in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
fair value is a market based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
the use of fair value to measure investments  with related unrealized gains or losses on investments  is a significant component to our consolidated results of operations 
we value our investments by using quoted market prices and broker or dealer quotations which are based on third party pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
the types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets include some of the government debt securities  some of the municipal debt securities  money market securities and most of the corporate debt securities 
we do not adjust the quoted price for such instruments 
the types of instruments valued based on other observable inputs include most of the municipal debt securities and some of the corporate debt securities 
the price for each security at the measurement date is sourced from an independent pricing vendor 
periodically  management may assess the reasonableness of these sourced prices by comparing them to the prices provided by our portfolio managers to derive the fair value of these financial instruments 
management assesses the inputs of the pricing in order to categorize the financial instruments into the appropriate hierarchy levels 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from software licenses  maintenance fees related to our software licenses  and professional services 
our license arrangements  whether involving a perpetual license or a term license  generally contain multiple elements 
in addition to the license  these elements generally include professional consulting services  training  and software maintenance services 
revenue from arrangements in which the fair value of one or more undelivered elements is unknown is deferred until the fair value of those elements is known and the residual value of the license can be determined 
software license revenues perpetual software license fees are recognized as revenue when the software is delivered  any acceptance required by contract that is not perfunctory is obtained  no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software other than maintenance support  and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
term software license fees are generally payable on a monthly basis under license agreements that typically have a three to five year term and may be renewed for additional terms at the customer s option 
as a result of our focus on frequent sales to our targeted customers  our strategy to sell initial term licensing agreements to those customers with the goal to generate follow on sales  and as a result of extended payment terms  we recognize term license revenue over the term of the agreement as payments become due or earlier if prepaid  provided all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
historically  the majority of our term license arrangements were larger agreements with extended payment terms that did not typically result in follow on license agreements 
we have a history of successfully collecting payments under the original payment terms  therefore for these arrangements  we have recognized the present value of the future term license payments upon customer acceptance  provided that no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software  other than maintenance support  and provided all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
a portion of the license fees payable under these agreements equal to the difference between the total license payments and the discounted present value of those payments was initially deferred and recognized as installment receivable interest income and is not part of total revenue over the license term 
for purposes of the present value calculations  the discount rates used were estimates of customers borrowing rates at the time of recognition  typically below prime rate  and have varied between and for the past few years 
as of december   the remaining balance of these installment receivables totaled approximately million as summarized in the table on page for licensing arrangements that include a right to unspecified future products  fees are accounted for as subscriptions and the revenue is recognized ratably over the economic life or term of the arrangement 

table of contents maintenance revenues maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the support period 
perpetual software maintenance revenue is recognized over the term of the related maintenance agreement  which is generally one year and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
for term licenses  we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the license term when the renewal rate or period is not substantive compared to the term license 
in general  maintenance and support obligations are based on separately stated renewal rates in the arrangement that are deemed substantive and therefore represent vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
professional services revenues our services revenue is comprised of fees for consulting services  including software implementation  and training 
consulting services may be provided on a stand alone basis or bundled with a license and software maintenance services 
revenue from training services and consulting services under time and materials contracts is recognized as services are performed 
we have vsoe of fair value for our training services  and consulting services under time and materials contracts 
services may be provided on a fixed price basis 
we do not have vsoe of fair value for fixed price services prior to completion of the services 
when fixed price services are part of a multiple element arrangement  and the services are not essential to the functionality of the software  and when services including maintenance  are the only undelivered element  we recognize the revenue from the total arrangement ratably over the longer of the software maintenance period or the service period 
in a limited number of our arrangements  the fixed price services are essential to the arrangement because we make significant alterations to the functionality of the software or build complex interfaces necessary for the software to be functional in the customer s environment 
we have not been able to make reasonably dependable estimates for the purpose of determining our progress to completion  as we have limited experience with these types of unique and complex arrangements 
accordingly  when the fixed price services are essential to the arrangement  all revenue and costs are deferred until the completion of the fixed price services under the completed contract method 
revenue from fixed price services that are not bundled with a software license is generally recognized as performed during the service period  which is typically less than four months 
we warrant to our customers that our software products will conform to documented specifications 
we have not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support  which we are already obligated to provide  and consequently we have not established reserves for warranty obligations 
our agreements with customers generally require us to indemnify the customer against claims that our software infringes third party patent  copyright  trademark or other proprietary rights 
such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industry standard respects  including our right to replace an infringing product 
as of december   we had not experienced any material losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding 
we do not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations  and consequently  we have not established any related reserves 
deferred project costs we defer direct costs when a project is being accounted for under the completed contract method or for certain arrangements where all of the required revenue recognition criteria have not been met 
we report these deferred project costs in other current assets 

table of contents deferred revenue deferred software license revenue typically results from customer specific acceptance provisions and other arrangements for which all of the criteria to recognize revenue have not been met 
deferred maintenance revenue represents software license updates and product support contracts that are typically billed on an annual basis in advance and are recognized ratably over the support periods 
deferred professional services revenue represents prepayments for consulting and education services that are recognized as the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for sales credit memos we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our estimates are based on the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if we used different assumptions  or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate that resulted in their inability to make required payments  additional provisions for doubtful accounts would be required and would increase bad debt expense 
we record allowances for estimates of potential sales credit memos 
we base these estimates on historical analyses of sales credit memos and assumptions about future events and experience with customer disputes 
if we used different assumptions in calculating the allowance  adjustments would be reflected as changes to revenue 
stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation expense associated with equity awards in our consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant 
we adopted the provisions of sfas r on january  using the modified prospective method  and  accordingly prior period amounts were not restated 
stock based compensation is recognized over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the equity award  and adjusted each period for anticipated forfeitures 
we recognize stock based compensation using the ratable method  which treats each vesting tranche as if it were an individual grant 
during the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved changes to our equity compensation program  including the granting of rsus in addition to stock options  for periodic equity compensation grants 
rsus deliver to the recipient a right to receive a specified number of shares of our common stock upon vesting  net of tax withholding 
unlike stock options  there is no cost to the employee at share issuance 
we value our rsus at the fair value of our common stock on the grant date  which is the closing price of our common stock on the grant date  less the present value of expected dividends as the employee is not entitled to dividends during the requisite service period 
we periodically grant stock options and rsus for a fixed number of shares to employees and non employee directors 
the exercise price for stock options is greater than or equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of the grant 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option valuation model  which requires us to make estimates of key assumptions including the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of our stock price over the option s expected term  the risk free interest rate over the option s expected term  and our expected annual dividend yield 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price 
the expected annual dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend of per share divided by the average stock price 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield of zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected option term at the time of grant 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 

table of contents the choice of a valuation model  and the underlying assumptions used in applying that model  involves significant judgment 
our judgment reflects our assessment of the most accurate method of valuing the stock options we issue based on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
our judgment could change over time as additional information becomes available to us  or the facts underlying our assumptions change over time  and any change in our judgments could have a material effect on our financial statements 
see note stock based compensation in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on the impact of sfas r to our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxes to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
as a global company  we use significant judgment to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries and potential challenges to nexus and credit estimates 
we estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and estimate the probability for such outcomes in accordance with the provisions of fin  which we adopted on january  see note income taxes in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on the impact of fin on our consolidated financial statements 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions  returns  and accruals 
such differences  or changes in estimates relating to potential differences  could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily related to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
to date we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions to manage risk in connection with such fluctuations 
foreign currency exposure we derived approximately   and of our total revenue from sales to customers based outside of the us in   and  respectively 
our international license and professional services sales have increasingly become denominated in foreign currencies 
however  the operating expenses of our foreign operations are primarily denominated in foreign currencies  which partially offset our foreign currency exposure 
a decrease in the value of foreign currencies  particularly the british pound and the euro relative to the us dollar  could adversely impact our revenues and operating results 
most of our transactions with customers are invoiced from our offices in the us for those transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  we have receivables and license installments that are valued in foreign currencies 
in addition  our us operating company holds cash and investments in foreign currencies in order to support our foreign operations 
our functional currency is the us dollar  therefore  when there are changes in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar  we recognize a foreign currency transaction gain or loss in other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of income 
as of december   we had net monetary assets valued in foreign currencies  consisting primarily of cash  license installments  and receivables  partially offset by accounts payable and accrued expenses  with a carrying value of approximately million 
during  we recorded a million foreign currency transaction loss due to the significant decrease in the value of foreign currencies  primarily the british pound and to a lesser extent the euro  relative to the us dollar 
as of december   a ten percent change in foreign currency exchange rates would have changed the carrying value of our net assets by approximately million as of that date with a corresponding currency gain loss recognized in our consolidated statement of income 
interest rate exposure our balance sheet contains interest bearing assets which have fixed rates of interest 
these assets include license installments receivable generated in the normal course of business through transactions with customers and our investments in marketable debt securities 
license installments receivable bear interest at the rate in effect when the license revenue was recognized  which does not vary throughout the life of the contractual cash flow stream 
changes in market rates do not affect net earnings as the license installments receivable are carried at cost and  since they are not financial instruments and are held until maturity  are not marked to market to reflect changes in the fair value of the portfolio 
the carrying value of our total license installment receivables was approximately million as of december   and reflects the weighted average of historic discount rates used to record each term license arrangement 
the balance of our license installments receivable has significantly declined as historical arrangements are billed and collected and no new license installment arrangements have been added to the portfolio 
we invest primarily in tax exempt municipal bonds  government sponsored enterprises and corporate bonds that are fixed rate marketable debt securities 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would have reduced the fair value of our marketable debt securities by approximately million as of december  changes in market rates and the related impact on fair value of the investments do not generally affect net earnings as our investments are fixed rate securities and are classified as available for sale and as such  unrealized gains and losses  net of tax effect  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in our 
table of contents accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
however  when the investments are sold  the unrealized gains and losses are recorded as realized gains and losses and included in net income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we analyze our investments for impairments on an ongoing basis 
factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the securities have been in an unrealized loss position and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated market recovery 
as of december   we did not directly or indirectly hold any auction rate securities or mortgage backed securities 
as of the date of this filing  we are not aware of any downgrades  losses  or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our marketable securities
