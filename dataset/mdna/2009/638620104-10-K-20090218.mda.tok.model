item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview to facilitate your review and understanding of this section of our report and the financial statements that follow  we are providing an overview of what management believes are the most important considerations for understanding our company and its business the key factors that drive our business and the principal associated risks 
who we are we are an investment grade rated since  public equity  healthcare reit 
we seek to maximize total stockholder return by passively investing in a safe  secure and growing asset base comprised of healthcare properties primarily senior housing facilities  long term care facilities and medical office buildings 
the healthcare sector is relatively recession resistant and presents unique growth potential as evidenced by the well known favorable demographics and increasing market penetration of a rapidly growing senior population  the increased use of healthcare services led by the aging baby boomer generation and  in each case  the corresponding recognized need for additional and improved healthcare facilities and services 
our management team has extensive operating backgrounds in senior housing and long term care that we believe provides us a competitive advantage in these sectors 
in  we established a full service medical office building platform comprised of a class a portfolio of facilities backed by well regarded property management services and development capabilities 
what we invest in we invest passively in the following types of geographically diversified healthcare properties senior housing assisted and independent living facilities alfs  ilfs and alzs 
this primarily private pay backed sector breaks down into three principal categories  each of which may be operated on a stand alone basis or combined with one or more of the others into a single facility or campus assisted living facilities alfs designed for frail seniors who can no longer live independently and instead need assistance with activities of daily living ie  feeding  dressing  bathing  etc 
but do not require round the clock skilled nursing care 
independent living facilities ilfs designed for seniors who pay for some concierge type services eg  meals  housekeeping  laundry  transportation  and social and recreational activities but require little  if any  assistance with activities of daily living 
alzheimer facilities alzs designed for those residents with significant cognitive impairment as a result of having alzheimer s or related dementia 
long term care skilled nursing facilities snfs 
this primarily government medicare and medicaid reimbursement backed sector consists of skilled nursing facilities designed for inpatient rehabilitative  restorative  skilled nursing and other medical treatment for residents who are medically stable and do not require the intensive care of an acute care or rehabilitative hospital 
continuing care retirement communities ccrcs 
these communities are designed to provide a continuum of care for residents as they age and their health deteriorates and typically combine on a defined campus integrated senior housing and long term care facilities 
medical office buildings mobs 
mobs usually house several different unrelated medical practices  although they can be associated with a large single specialty or multi specialty group 
mob tenants include physicians  dentists  psychologists  therapists and other healthcare providers  with space devoted to patient examination and treatment  diagnostic imaging  outpatient surgery and other outpatient services 
since an mob generally has several tenants under separate leases  they require day to day property management services that typically include rent collection from disparate tenants  re marketing space as it becomes vacant and  for non triple net leases  responsibility for many of the mob s 
table of contents associated operating expenses although many of these are  or can effectively be  passed through to the tenants as well 
mobs are generally classified as being either on campus or off campus 
on campus mobs typically are located on or immediately adjacent to an acute care hospital campus and are generally subject to a hospital ground lease 
its tenants are primarily doctors whose patients have been or will be treated at the hospital 
the relationship with a vibrant hospital tends to create stronger tenant demand  generate higher rental rates  provide higher tenant retention and discourage competitive new supply as compared to most off campus mobs that are unaffiliated with a healthcare system 
off campus mobs have become more and more prevalent as healthcare has increasingly shifted from the inpatient model to the typically less expensive outpatient model 
instead of typically being subject to a hospital ground lease with operating and use restrictions limiting the owner s control over the facility  including as a practical matter the ability to aggressively raise rents  owners of off campus mobs typically have full ownership of the facility and control over all leasing and operating decisions 
further  those affiliated with a healthcare system may also enjoy many of the same advantages as an on campus facility 
how we do it using a three prong foundation that focuses on proactive capital management  active portfolio management and quality funds from operations ffo growth  we typically invest in senior housing facilities  long term care facilities and medical office buildings as provided below 
senior housing and long term care facilities including ccrcs 
we primarily make our investments in these properties passively by acquiring an ownership interest in facilities and leasing them to unaffiliated tenants under triple net master leases that transfer the obligation for all facility operating costs insurance  property taxes  utilities  maintenance  capital improvements  etc 
to the tenants 
in addition  but to a much lesser extent because we view the risks of this activity to be greater due to less favorable bankruptcy treatment and other factors  from time to time  we extend mortgage loans and other financing to tenants  generally at higher rates than we charge for rent on our owned facilities to compensate us for the additional risk 
currently  about of our revenues from this area are derived from our leases  with the remaining from our mortgage loans and other financing 
medical office buildings mobs 
we generally lease medical office buildings to multiple tenants under separate non triple net leases  where we are responsible for many of the associated operating expenses although many of these are  or can effectively be  passed through to the tenants  and to single tenants under triple net master leases like those referred to above 
until  we primarily made our multi tenant mob investments in mobs through joint ventures with specialists in this sector that would manage the venture and provide property management services 
in  we expanded our capabilities by executing on our strategic initiative to establish a full service mob platform through a multi faceted transaction with pacific medical buildings llc pmb 
first  we acquired from pmb and certain of its affiliates their interests in class a mobs for million 
these mobs comprise over thousand square feet and are located in california  nevada and oregon 
second  we entered into an agreement with pmb pursuant to which we currently have the right  but not the obligation  to acquire up to approximately billion of mobs to be developed by pmb through april finally  we acquired from pmb a interest in pmb real estate services llc pmbres  a full service property management company 
pmbres provides property and asset management services for the above and other mobs we previously acquired from affiliates of pmb 
how we measure our progress funds from operations we believe that ffo is an important non gaap supplemental measure of operating performance because it excludes the effect of depreciation and gains losses from sales of facilities both of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance 
additionally  ffo is 
table of contents widely used by industry analysts as a measure of operating performance for equity reits 
we therefore discuss ffo  although it is a measurement that is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts definition 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states it does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and  therefore  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
what we have accomplished over the last three years we have enjoyed numerous successes since the end of  perhaps the most notable of which are as follows investments 
we invested  directly and through our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures  billion in the last three years  growing our net investments in real estate from billion at the end of to billion at the end of during this period  we strategically diversified our asset base through investments in an mob platform and facilities representing of our investments at the end of coupled with our capital and portfolio management initiatives  over the past three years this growing asset base enabled us to accomplish the following quality  recurring ffo growth we increased our adjusted ffo per share over from per share in to per share in growing dividend we increased our cash dividend from per share in to per share in capital more flexible and diverse structure and conservative balance sheet 
our overall capital goal has been to balance the debt and equity components of our capital structure  increase our sources of capital  enhance our credit statistics  preserve and strengthen our investment grade credit ratings moody s investors service baa  standard poor s ratings service bbb and fitch ratings bbb and continue to protect our dividend 
in addition  in response to the crises in the capital and credit markets  in we strived to maximize our liquidity 
we believe we have accomplished all of these goals  with the following items being particularly noteworthy over the past three years conservative leverage we reduced our debt to equity ratio on an undepreciated book basis from at the end of to at the end of multiple capital sources we added the following to our existing million credit facility and traditional marketed debt and equity capital sources controlled equity offering we implemented a program in under which we periodically issue equity with a targeted price greater than the volume weighted average price  subject to fees of under 
to date  we have issued approximately million shares of common stock under this program  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
institutional joint venture capital we formed a joint venture in january with a state pension fund investor advised by morgan stanley real estate to provide an additional capital source 
the joint venture has invested million in assisted and independent living facilities  skilled nursing facilities and continuing care retirement communities  including million in facilities acquired by the joint venture from us  and has an approved capacity to invest up to million in these property types 
asset management capital in  we sold to brookdale senior housing assets previously leased to them for about million a capitalization rate on our rent  resulting in a gain on sale of million  with the proceeds reinvested at an starting rent rate in new investments with new growth oriented customers 
in addition to the above sales to the institutional joint venture  in  we sold skilled nursing facilities primarily located in texas with an average age of years for million an capitalization rate on our rent  
table of contents resulting in a gain on sale of million and invested a total of million at an average starting rate of in newer skilled nursing facilities located in multiple states 
in  we sold to emeritus senior housing assets previously leased to them for million a capitalization rate on our rent  resulting in a gain on sale of million and retained the net proceeds to bolster our liquidity 
enhanced credit statistics we increased our adjusted fixed charge coverage from x at the end of to x at the end of enhanced credit ratings following the announcement of our multi faceted mob transaction with pmb  both moody s and fitch upgraded us to a positive watch  while s p reaffirmed its rating 
dividend secure and growing we maintained our dividend coverage ratio dividends per share divided by recurring diluted ffo per share at about  while our dividend increased 
maximized liquidity retained million in cash and full availability on our million credit line at the end of portfolio management implemented sophisticated program 
since the end of  we have continued to dramatically upgrade our portfolio management program by enhancing the proprietary software system we developed  adding six dedicated portfolio management personnel and proactively anticipating and responding to potential problem areas 
we believe we now have one of the most sophisticated portfolio management programs in our industry 
focus and outlook for typically  our primary focus for the new year would be continuing to improve our net income and ffo on an absolute and per share basis and further diversifying and upgrading our portfolio  while also continuing to explore alternative capital sources  investment structures  joint ventures and property types that would enable us to compete more effectively in the markets in which we invest 
normally  we would rely on the rent escalators generally between and contained in many of our leases as a source of substantial built in internal net income and ffo growth 
however  since most of these escalators are tied to annual increases in the consumer price index  which recently have trended negatively  we are likely to see much less  if any  internal growth from these rent escalators as long as deflationary conditions continue 
moreover  at this time external growth appears more problematic as we continue to be confronted with unprecedented adverse capital markets and economic conditions  with the resulting tighter credit conditions and slower growth that evolved in continuing for the foreseeable future 
specifically  continued concerns about the recession which is nearing the longest duration since the great depression  the uncertainty over whether our economy will be adversely impacted by inflation  deflation or stagflation  and the systemic impact of energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the us have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the us economy 
this difficult operating environment may make it more difficult for some or many of our tenants to pay their rent 
the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
notably  with million in cash and million available under our credit facility at the end of  we believe we have more than adequate liquidity to address our business commitments over the next two years 
while we have no current reason to believe that we will be unable to access the credit facility in the future  concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of borrowers specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and  in some cases  cease to provide  funding to borrowers 
the economic downturn and credit crisis has adversely impacted financial institutions resulting in the bankruptcy or merger of many of them and other companies that could in turn adversely impact our ability to draw on our credit facility 
if we were unable to access our credit facility it could result in an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
in addition  further deterioration of economic conditions and continued turbulence in market conditions may adversely affect the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants 

table of contents our plans for growth require regular access to the capital and credit markets 
if capital is not available at an acceptable cost  it will significantly impair our ability to make future investments as acquisitions and development projects become difficult or impractical to pursue 
similarly  our growth plans could be retarded  our financial position weakened and our ability to make distributions limited if deteriorating general economic conditions or other factors led to any of our major senior housing or other tenants being unable to meet their obligations to us 
we have no operational control over our tenants 
there may end up being more serious tenant financial problems that lead to more extensive restructurings or tenant disruptions than we currently expect 
this could be unique to a particular tenant or it could be more industry wide  such as continuing reduced occupancies for our assisted and independent living facilities due to the severely distressed housing and credit markets  unemployment or other factors and reduced federal or state governmental reimbursement reductions in the case of our skilled nursing facilities as governments work through their severe budget deficits 
with that  our focus for initially will be primarily threefold closely monitor and maximize our liquidity until we are reasonably comfortable that reasonable and ready access to the capital and credit markets has returned  closely monitor the capital and credit markets looking for opportunities to access capital at a reasonable cost  and closely monitor the performance of our tenants and use our unique operating backgrounds to proactively identify and address potential problems that may develop 
critical accounting estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that impact our most critical accounting policies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 
principles of consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of nhp  its wholly owned subsidiaries and its joint ventures that are controlled through voting rights or other means 
we apply financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised fin r  for arrangements with variable interest entities vies and would consolidate those vies where we are the primary beneficiary 
we also apply emerging issues task force eitf issue  investor s accounting for an investment in a limited partnership when the investor is the sole general partner and the limited partners have certain rights eitf  to investments in joint ventures 
our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie involves the consideration of various factors including  but not limited to  the form of our ownership interest  our representation on the entity s governing body  the size of our investment  estimates of future cash flows  our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture  if applicable 
our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity or determine the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition rental income from operating leases is recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  including statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for leases and sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition as amended by sec sab no 
our leases generally contain annual escalators 
most of our leases contain non contingent rent 
table of contents escalators for which we recognize income on a straight line basis over the lease term 
recognizing income on a straight line basis requires us to calculate the total non contingent rent to be paid over the life of a lease and to recognize the revenue evenly over that life 
this method results in rental income in the early years of a lease being higher than actual cash received  creating a straight line rent receivable asset included in the caption other assets on our balance sheets 
at some point during the lease  depending on its terms  the cash rent payments eventually exceed the straight line rent which results in the straight line rent receivable asset decreasing to zero over the remainder of the lease term 
we assess the collectibility of straight line rents in accordance with the applicable accounting standards and our reserve policy and defer recognition of straight line rent if its collectibility is not reasonably assured 
certain leases contain escalators contingent on revenues or other factors  including increases based on changes in the consumer price index 
such revenue increases are recognized over the lease term as the related contingencies occur 
our assessment of the collectibility of straight line rents is based on several factors  including the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors  the historical operations and operating trends of the facility  the historical payment pattern of the tenant  the type of facility and whether we intend to continue to lease the facility to the current tenant  among others 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates we may not receive the rent payments due in the future  we defer recognition of the straight line rental income and  depending on the circumstances  we will provide a reserve against the previously recognized straight line rent receivable asset for a portion  up to its full value  that we estimate may not be recoverable 
if our assumptions or estimates regarding the collectibility of future rent payments required by a lease change  we may have to record a reserve to reduce or further reduce the rental revenue recognized or to reserve or further reserve the existing straight line rent receivable balance 
we recorded million of revenues in excess of cash received during  million of revenues in excess of cash during and million of revenues in excess of cash during we have straight line rent receivables  net of reserves  recorded under the caption other assets on our balance sheets of million at december   and million at december  net of reserves of million and million  respectively 
we evaluate the collectibility of the straight line rent receivable balances on an ongoing basis and provide reserves against receivables we believe may not be fully recoverable 
the ultimate amount of straight line rent we realize could be less than amounts recorded 
depreciation and useful lives of assets we calculate depreciation on our buildings and improvements using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives ranging up to years  generally from to years depending on factors including building type  age  quality and location 
a significant portion of the cost of each property is allocated to buildings 
for our triple net leased buildings  this amount generally approximates 
for medical office buildings that are not leased under a single triple net lease  this percentage may be substantially lower as we allocate purchase prices in accordance with sfas no 
business combinations sfas no 
which generally results in substantial allocations to assets such as lease up intangible assets  above market tenant and ground lease intangible assets and in place lease intangible assets collectively  intangible assets included on our balance sheets and or below market tenant and ground lease intangible liabilities included in the caption accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our balance sheets 
the allocation of the cost between land and building  and the determination of the useful life of a property are based on management s estimates  which are based in part on independent appraisals or other consultants reports 
we calculate depreciation and amortization on equipment and lease costs using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of up to five years or the lease term  whichever is appropriate 
we amortize intangible assets and liabilities over the remaining lease terms of the respective leases 
we review and adjust useful lives periodically 
if we do not allocate appropriately between land and building or we incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our assets  our computation of depreciation and amortization will not appropriately reflect the usage of the assets over future periods 
if we overestimate the useful life of an asset  the depreciation expense related to the asset will be understated  which could result in a loss if the asset is sold in the future 

table of contents asset impairment we review our long lived assets individually on a quarterly basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
and sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

indicators may include  among others  a tenant s inability to make rent payments  operating losses or negative operating trends at the facility level  notification by a tenant that it will not renew its lease  or a decision to dispose of an asset or adverse changes in the fair value of any of our properties 
for operating assets  if indicators of impairment exist  we compare the undiscounted cash flows from the expected use of the property to its net book value to determine if impairment exists 
if the sum of the future estimated undiscounted cash flows is higher than the current net book value  in accordance with sfas no 
 we conclude no impairment exists 
if the sum of the future estimated undiscounted cash flows is lower than its current net book value  we recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the net book value of the asset and its estimated fair value 
to the extent we decide to sell an asset  we recognize an impairment loss if the current net book value of the asset exceeds its fair value less selling costs 
the above analyses require us to determine whether there are indicators of impairment for individual assets  to estimate the most likely stream of cash flows from operating assets and to determine the fair value of assets that are impaired or held for sale 
if our assumptions  projections or estimates regarding an asset change in the future  we may have to record an impairment charge to reduce or further reduce the net book value of such asset 
no impairment charges were recorded during the years ended december  and december  collectibility of receivables we evaluate the collectibility of our rent  mortgage loans and other receivables on a regular basis based on factors including  among others  payment history  the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantors  the value of the underlying collateral  the operations and operating trends of the underlying collateral  if any  the asset type and current economic conditions 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates we may not recover the full value of the receivable  we provide a reserve against the portion of the receivable that we estimate may not be recovered 
this analysis requires us to determine whether there are factors indicating a receivable may not be fully collectible and to estimate the amount of the receivable that may not be collected 
if our assumptions or estimates regarding the collectibility of a receivable change in the future  we may have to record a reserve to reduce or further reduce the carrying value of the receivable 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate our compliance with reit requirements 
our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws  and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized 
adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by federal and state tax authorities  ii our ability to qualify as a reit  iii the potential for built in gain recognized related to prior tax free acquisitions of c corporations  and iv changes in tax laws 
adjustments required in any given period are included in income  other than adjustments to income tax liabilities acquired in business combinations  which would be adjusted through goodwill

other factors that affect our business hearthstone senior services  lp on june   we acquired assisted living and alzheimer s facilities from hearthstone assisted living  inc for million 
in connection with the acquisition  we leased all of the facilities to hearthstone senior services  lp hearthstone  a new company formed by hearthstone assisted living  inc s president and ceo  tim hekker and two partners 
hearthstone s only operations consist of the management of these facilities 
the lease has an initial term of years and provides for a base rent that started at approximately million per year and increases each year by up to 
in addition  hearthstone agreed to pay over the initial term of the lease supplemental rent equal to a specified percentage of hearthstone s annual gross revenue 
in accordance with the lease  payment of supplemental rent of million for the first months of the lease was deferred until june  when it became payable in monthly installments  and supplemental rent from june initially  per month is to be paid quarterly starting in september none of this supplemental rent has been recognized by us as revenue 
additionally  in june  base rent increased  per month 
hearthstone has failed to pay the deferred supplemental rent of  per month 
hearthstone has notified us that it is currently unable to make such payments and has sought to renegotiate the terms of our lease 
as of january   however  hearthstone is current on all other rent payments required under the lease 
we are currently assessing our options for the hearthstone facilities  which may involve modifying the lease terms  or terminating the lease and finding a new tenant for the facilities 
although we have a million letter of credit that secures hearthstone s payment obligations to us which we have not yet drawn on  it is possible that the letter of credit may not be sufficient to compensate us for all costs that may arise in connection with a modification of the lease or our pursuit of other remedies 
in addition  at december   we had accrued million of straight line non cash rent receivable from hearthstone  some or all of which may need to be reserved in the future  depending on our evaluation of its collectibility 
leases and mortgage loans our leases and mortgages generally contain provisions under which rents or interest income increase with increases in facility revenues and or increases in the consumer price index 
if facility revenues and or the consumer price index which has recently trended negatively do not increase  our revenues may not increase 
rent levels under renewed leases will also impact revenues 
excluding multi tenant mobs  as of december   we had leases on five facilities expiring in tenant purchase option exercises would decrease rental income 
we believe our tenants may exercise purchase options on assets with option prices totaling approximately million during 
table of contents acquisitions we expect to make additional acquisitions during  although we cannot predict the quantity and timing of any such acquisitions 
as we make additional investments in facilities  depreciation and or interest expense will also increase 
we expect any such increases to be at least partially offset by associated rental or interest income 
while additional investments in healthcare facilities would increase revenues  facility sales or mortgage repayments would serve to offset any revenue increases and could reduce revenues 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased million  or  in as compared to this was primarily due to the collection of certain amounts included in the caption other assets during  increased straight line rent and other receivables and receivables for reserves  as well as increased medical office building operating expenses  interest and general and administrative expenses  offset in part by revenue increases from our owned facilities and mortgage and other loans as a result of acquisitions and funding of mortgage and other loans during and there have been no significant changes in the underlying sources and uses of cash provided by operating activities

during  we also acquired one of the medical office buildings directly not through nhp pmb for million  including acquisition costs 
pursuant to the agreement with pmb  certain conditions must be met in order for us to be obligated to purchase the seven remaining medical office buildings 
we recently elected to terminate the agreement with respect to one property after the conditions requiring us to close on such property were not met 
additionally  we entered into another agreement with pmb pursuant to which we currently have the right  but not the obligation  to acquire up to approximately billion of multi tenant medical office buildings developed by pmb through april during  we acquired assisted and independent living facilities  skilled nursing facilities and medical office buildings subject to triple net master leases in separate transactions for an aggregate investment of million 
we also funded million in expansions  construction and capital improvements at certain facilities in accordance with existing lease provisions 
such expansions  construction and capital improvements generally result in an increase in the minimum rents earned by us on these facilities either at the time of funding or upon completion of the project 
at december   we had committed to fund additional expansions  construction and capital improvements of million 
during  we acquired  out of bankruptcy  title to one skilled nursing facility securing a previously impaired mortgage loan with a net book value of million which approximated our estimate of fair value of the facility and was allocated to land and building 
subsequent to acquiring title to the facility  we entered into a lease for this facility with a third party who was one of our existing tenants

during  we sold assisted and independent living facilities and two skilled nursing facilities 
of the facilities  we sold assisted and independent living facilities to emeritus corporation emeritus  the tenant of the facilities  for a gross purchase price of million 
in connection with the sale  we retired million of secured debt and provided emeritus with a loan in the amount of million included in the caption other assets on our balance sheets at a rate of per annum for a term of not more than four years

our credit facility requires us to maintain  among other things  the financial covenants detailed below covenant requirement actual dollar amounts in thousands minimum net asset value maximum total indebtedness to capitalization value minimum fixed charge coverage ratio maximum secured indebtedness ratio maximum unencumbered asset value ratio our credit facility allows us to exceed the requirements  up to a maximum of  on the maximum total indebtedness to capitalization value and maximum unencumbered asset value ratio for up to two consecutive fiscal quarters 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the above covenants  and we expect to remain in compliance throughout 
table of contents during  in connection with the sale of assisted and independent living facilities to emeritus  the tenant of the facilities  we prepaid million of fixed rate secured debt that bore interest at a weighted average rate of 
the prepayments were funded by a portion of the net cash proceeds from the sale to emeritus 
during  we repaid million of fixed rate notes with a weighted average rate of at maturity and prepaid million of fixed rate notes with a weighted average rate of 
the prepayments resulted in a gain totaling million which is reflected as gain on debt extinguishment on our statements of operations 
the payments were funded by borrowings on our credit facility and by cash on hand 
we anticipate repaying senior notes at maturity with a combination of proceeds from borrowings on our credit facility and cash on hand 
borrowings on our credit facility could be repaid by potential asset sales or the repayment of mortgage loans receivable  the potential issuance of debt or equity securities under the shelf registration statement discussed below or cash from operations 
our senior notes have been investment grade rated since our credit ratings at december  were baa from moody s investors service  bbb from standard poor s ratings services and bbb from fitch ratings 
we enter into sales agreements from time to time with cantor fitzgerald co 
to sell shares of our common stock from time to time through a controlled equity offering program 
during  we sold  shares of common stock at a weighted average price of  resulting in net proceeds of million after sales fees 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold  shares of common stock at a weighted average price of  resulting in net proceeds of million after sales fees 
we sponsor a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan that enables existing stockholders to purchase additional shares of common stock by automatically reinvesting all or part of the cash dividends paid on their shares of common stock 
the plan also allows investors to acquire shares of our common stock  subject to certain limitations  including a maximum monthly investment of  at a discount ranging from to  determined by us from time to time in accordance with the plan 
the discount during was 
during  we issued approximately  shares of common stock  at an average price of  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
at december   we had a shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue securities including debt  convertible debt  common and preferred stock 
in addition  at december   we had approximately  shares of common stock available for issuance under our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
assuming certain conditions are met under our agreement with pmb and we are obligated to close the remaining buildings  we would expect to finance the acquisitions of these buildings with a combination of million in assumed debt  the issuance of limited partnership interests in nhp pmb  cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility 
financing for other future investments and for the repayment of the obligations and commitments noted above may be provided by cash on hand  borrowings under our credit facility discussed above  the sale of debt or equity securities in private placements or public offerings  which may be made under the shelf registration statement discussed above or under new registration statements  proceeds from asset sales or mortgage loan receivable payoffs  the assumption of secured indebtedness  or mortgage financing on a portion of our owned portfolio or through joint ventures 
we estimate that  as of december   we could have borrowed up to billion of additional debt  and incurred additional annual interest expense of up to million  and remained in compliance with our existing debt covenants 
recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth through the latter part of continued concerns about the systemic impact of 
table of contents inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the us have contributed to diminished expectations for the us economy and financial markets 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
we had million available under our credit facility at december   and we have no current reason to believe that we will be unable to access the facility in the future 
however  concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of borrowers specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and  in some cases  cease to provide  funding to borrowers 
if we were unable to access our credit facility  it could result in an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
in addition  continued turbulence in market conditions may adversely affect the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants 
we have approximately million of indebtedness that matures in and million of indebtedness that matures in additionally  some of our senior notes can be put to us prior to the stated maturity date 
we have approximately million of such senior notes that we may be required to repay in and none that we may be required to repay in if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability  and the ability of our tenants  to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs  resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest rate and related payments that vary with the movement of libor or other indexes 
if the current market turbulence continues  there could be a rise in interest rates which could reduce our profitability or adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations 
our plans for growth require regular access to the capital and credit markets 
if capital is not available at an acceptable cost  it will significantly impair our ability to make future investments as acquisitions and development projects become difficult or impractical to pursue 
we anticipate the possible sale of certain facilities  primarily due to purchase option exercises 
in addition  mortgage loans receivable might be prepaid 
in the event that there are facility sales or mortgage loan receivable repayments in excess of new investments  revenues may decrease 
we anticipate using the proceeds from any facility sales or mortgage loans receivable repayments to provide capital for future investments  to reduce any outstanding balance on our credit facility or to repay other borrowings as they mature 
any such reduction in debt levels would result in reduced interest expense that we believe would partially offset any decrease in revenues 
we believe the combination of cash on hand  the ability to draw on our million credit facility and the ability to sell securities under the shelf registration statement  as well as our unconsolidated joint venture with a state pension fund investor  provide sufficient liquidity and financing capability to finance anticipated future investments  maintain our current dividend level and repay borrowings at or prior to their maturity  for at least the next months

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our mortgage loans receivable and debt 
we may hold derivative instruments to manage our exposure to these risks  and all derivative instruments are matched against specific debt obligations 
the purpose of the following analyses is to provide a framework to understand our sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  readers are cautioned that many of the statements contained in these paragraphs are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the heading statement regarding forward looking disclosure set forth above 
we provide mortgage loans to tenants of healthcare facilities as part of our normal operations  which generally have fixed rates  and all mortgage loans receivable are treated as fixed rate notes in the table and analysis below 
we utilize debt financing primarily for the purpose of making additional investments in healthcare facilities 
historically  we have made short term borrowings on our variable rate unsecured revolving credit facility to fund our acquisitions until market conditions were appropriate  based on management s judgment  to issue stock or fixed rate debt to provide long term financing 
a portion of our secured debt has variable rates 
during the twelve months ended december   the borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility have decreased from million to none 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect the future earnings and cash flows 
we generally cannot prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity 
therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on 
table of contents the fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 
holding the variable rate debt balance constant  and including the bank borrowings as variable rate debt due to its nature  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately million 
the first table below details the principal amounts and the average interest rates for the mortgage loans receivable and debt for each category based on the final maturity dates as of december  certain of the mortgage loans receivable and certain items in the various categories of debt require periodic principal payments prior to the final maturity date 
the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans 
the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing rates we would expect to pay for debt of a similar type and remaining maturity 
maturity date thereafter total book value fair value dollars in thousands assets mortgage loans receivable average interest rate liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate unsecured revolving credit facility average interest rate total book value of mortgage loans excludes deferred gains of million 
any future interest rate increases will increase the cost of borrowings on our bank line of credit and any borrowings to refinance long term debt as it matures or to finance future acquisitions
