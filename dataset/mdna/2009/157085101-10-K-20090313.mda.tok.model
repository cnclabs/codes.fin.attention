intercept blood system for plasma the intercept blood system for plasma  or plasma system  is designed to inactivate blood borne pathogens in donated plasma for transfusion 
the plasma system has received ce mark approval in europe and is marketed and sold in several countries in europe and in russia 
we have prioritized the commercial launch of the plasma system in europe ahead of further regulatory efforts to obtain approval of the plasma system in the united states 
we obtained french approval of intercept treated plasma in early pathogen inactivated plasma for transfusion is already reimbursed in many european countries  including france 
information regarding our revenues from the plasma system for the years ended december    and can be found in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  and item a consolidated financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on from k 
intercept blood system for red blood cells the intercept blood system for red blood cells  or red blood cell system  is designed to inactivate blood borne pathogens in donated red blood cells for transfusion 
in september  we terminated the phase iii clinical trials of the red blood cell system due to the detection of antibody reactivity to intercept treated red blood cells in one patient in the chronic arm of the trial 
however  there were no medical sequelae associated with intercept treated red blood cells evident in this trial 
the antibody cleared and the patient had no adverse health consequences 
after unblinding the data from the phase iii clinical trial  we found that we had met the primary end point in the acute arm of the clinical trial 
we evaluated the antibodies detected in the clinical trial and have developed process changes designed to diminish the likelihood of antibody reactivity in red blood cells treated with our modified process 
we initiated a new phase i clinical trial for the red blood cell system in the united states in the second half with our modified process  which was completed in mid while we determined that the modifications we tested in this phase i clinical trial appeared to be safe  they resulted in 
table of contents dehydration and an unacceptably short lifespan of the treated red blood cells 
in  we completed a series of in vitro and in vivo tests with further modifications to the red blood cell system designed to correct the shorted lifespan and initiated another phase i clinical trial in the fourth quarter of subject to the availability of adequate funding from partners  government grants  and or capital markets  we expect to spend approximately two years developing and implementing commercial product and system design changes to the original red blood cell system prior to entering phase iii clinical trials 
we may be unable to fund continued commercial product and system design efforts and required phase iii clinical trials  unless we obtain third party funding for such efforts 
collaborations baxter we collaborated with baxter on the development and commercialization of the intercept blood system commencing in we obtained worldwide commercialization rights to the red blood cell system from baxter in february effective february   we entered into a restructuring of our agreements with baxter pursuant to which we obtained exclusive worldwide commercialization rights to the platelet and plasma systems  excluding certain asian countries where the commercialization rights had been licensed to bioone 
we agreed to pay baxter royalties on future intercept blood system product sales at royalty rates that vary by product of product sales for the platelet system  for the plasma system  for the red blood cell system  and on sales of uva illuminators 
in march  baxter sold its transfusion therapies business  the unit of baxter that has performed many of the manufacturing and supply chain activities related to our relationship with baxter  to a new company  fenwal  inc  or fenwal 
we were informed by baxter that fenwal had assumed baxter s rights and obligations under our agreements 
bioone in june  we and baxter entered into a definitive agreement with bioone for commercialization of our platelet system in specified parts of asia 
under the terms of the agreement  bioone is responsible  at its expense  for seeking regulatory approvals for and commercializing the platelet system in japan  china  taiwan  south korea  thailand  vietnam and singapore 
bioone received exclusive marketing and distribution rights in each of those countries 
we understand baxter transferred its rights and obligations with regard to bioone to fenwal 
we have received a total of million in up front payments under the terms of the agreement and will be eligible to receive contingent milestone payments and royalties on future product sales  which will be shared equally between fenwal and us 
in june  we and baxter entered into a definitive agreement with bioone for commercialization of our plasma system in specified parts of asia 
under the terms of the agreement  bioone is responsible  at its expense  for seeking regulatory approvals for and commercializing the plasma system in japan  china  taiwan  south korea  thailand  vietnam and singapore 
bioone received exclusive marketing and distribution rights in each of those countries 
we received a total of million in cash as well as equity securities in bioone valued at million at the time of issuance in connection with the agreement  and will be eligible to receive i contingent milestone payments  payable to us solely  and ii royalties on future product sales  which will be shared by fenwal and us 
at december   we reported an investment in bioone of million on our consolidated balance sheets 
we received no significant milestone or royalty payments from bioone in united states armed forces in february  we were awarded million under a cooperative agreement with the army medical research acquisition activity division of the department of defense  or dod 
since then  we have been awarded an aggregate of million under awards and cooperative agreements with the dod  all of which was for the continued funding of projects to develop our pathogen inactivation technologies to improve the safety and availability of blood for medical transfusions 
under the terms of the cooperative agreements  we are conducting 
table of contents research on the inactivation of infectious pathogens in blood  including unusual viruses  bacteria and parasites  which are of concern to the united states armed forces 
investment in anza therapeutics  inc effective october   we ceased funding operations of our former immunotherapy business 
in november  we announced that we had sold certain assets that made up our immunotherapy business  including our listeria and killed but metabolically active  or kbma  platform technologies  to a newly formed independent company  anza therapeutics  inc  or anza  financed by venture capital firms 
in exchange for our contribution of tangible and intangible assets to anza  we received preferred stock representing an equity interest of approximately of anza s preferred equity 
there is no assurance that the equity will have monetary value at such time we are able to sell it or that we will receive any proceeds in the event of liquidation or sale of anza 
the terms of sale provided anza a right to redeem up to  of such shares for a nominal amount upon the failure to occur of certain circumstances relating to possible research grant funding from the dod 
we were advised informally in february that based upon such provision  anza may seek to redeem  shares held by us 
if such shares were redeemed by anza  we would own fewer shares of anza s preferred stock  reducing our preferred equity interest to approximately of anza s outstanding preferred equity 
we are evaluating whether such clause is applicable in the present circumstances 
we were informed in february that anza had ceased operations 
the immunotherapy business is accounted for as a discontinued operation on our financial statements as of december  accordingly  we restated our statements of operations for periods prior to december  to reflect that accounting treatment 
manufacturing and supply we have used  and intend to continue to use  third parties to manufacture and supply the devices  disposable kits and inactivation compounds that make up the intercept blood system for use in clinical trials and for commercialization 
we have no experience in manufacturing products for clinical or commercial purposes 
we are dependent on fenwal for the manufacture of intercept blood system disposable kits and on contract manufacturers for the production of inactivation compounds  compound adsorption components of the disposable kits and uva illumination devices used in the intercept blood system 
on december   we entered into an amended and restated manufacturing and supply agreement with fenwal that amends and restates our february manufacturing and supply agreement with baxter  which was assumed by fenwal in under the amended agreement  fenwal is obligated to sell  and we are obligated to purchase  finished disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems for both clinical and commercial use 
the agreement permits us to purchase platelet and plasma kits from third party manufacturers provided that we meet certain annual minimum purchase obligations to fenwal 
we are responsible for developing and delivering to fenwal our proprietary inactivation compounds and adsorption media for incorporation into the final system configuration 
the agreement revises the pricing of purchased products for both clinical and commercial use 
fenwal is obligated to sell us a predetermined number of illuminators in fenwal s existing inventory  but we will be otherwise free to purchase illuminators directly from third party manufacturers  including nova biomedical corporation  or nova 
the term of the fenwal agreement extends through december   and is automatically renewed for one year terms  subject to termination by either party upon thirty months prior written notice  in the case of fenwal  or twenty four months prior written notice  in our case 
we and fenwal each have normal and customary termination rights  including termination for material breach 
following the december fenwal agreement  we are responsible for the full management and control of the supply chain for the intercept illuminator devices and certain other components of the platelet and plasma kits 
in anticipation of this obligation  we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with 
table of contents nova on september  under the terms of the nova agreement  we have the ability to purchase illuminators directly from nova 
we previously contracted with nova for the calibration and maintenance of the illuminators that we previously purchased from baxter and fenwal 
nova has also previously supplied to us components of the intercept platelet and plasma systems to cover repair contingencies and for preventive maintenance 
the term of the nova agreement extends through september and is automatically renewable for one year terms  subject to termination by either party upon twelve months prior written notice 
we have contracted with one manufacturing facility for the synthesis of amotosalen  an inactivation compound used in our platelet and plasma systems 
under this contract  we are not subject to minimum annual purchase requirements 
however  if specified quantities of amotosalen are not purchased in any year  we are required to pay a maintenance fee of up to  for such year 
we currently have a stock of the compound sufficient to support the anticipated commercial demand for the platelet and plasma systems 
we and our contract manufacturers  including fenwal and nova  purchase certain raw materials for our disposable kits  inactivation compounds  materials and parts associated with compound adsorption devices and uva illumination devices from a limited number of suppliers  some of which may require minimum annual purchase amounts 
we understand that a raw material supplier to baxter  which in turn supplies fenwal  for a proprietary plastic used in the platelet and plasma systems disposable kits  has ceased production  and that baxter may be unable to identify an alternate supplier on a timely basis 
while we believe that there are alternative sources of supply for such materials  parts and devices  establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of the raw materials  parts and devices  if required  may not be accomplished quickly and could involve significant additional costs and potential regulatory reviews 
any failure to obtain from alternative suppliers of the materials used to manufacture our disposable kits  inactivation compounds or materials and parts used to manufacture our compound absorption devices and uva illumination devices  if required  would limit our ability to supply these materials  parts or devices 
marketing  sales and distribution the market for the intercept blood system is dominated by a small number of blood collection organizations in the united states  western europe  russia  the middle east  and japan  where various national blood transfusion services or red cross organizations collect  store and distribute virtually all of their respective nations blood and blood component supplies 
the largest european markets for our products are in england  germany and france 
in england  decisions on product adoption are centralized in the national blood service 
in germany  decisions on product adoption are made on a regional or blood center by blood center basis 
while obtaining ce marks allows us to sell the platelet and plasma systems to blood centers in germany  blood centers in germany must still obtain both local manufacturing approval and national marketing authorization from the paul ehrlich institute before being allowed to sell platelets and plasma units treated with the intercept blood system to transfusing hospitals and physicians 
to date  several blood centers in germany have received such requisite approvals and authorizations for the platelet system 
in france  broad product adoption is dependent on a central decision by the etablissement francais du sang  or efs  and then a national supply contract being negotiated 
our ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement for product costs and related treatment of blood components from governmental authorities and private health care insurers including health maintenance organizations  which are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both the extent of coverage and the reimbursement rate for new tests and treatments 
national reimbursement rates for pathogen inactivated platelet and plasma have been agreed upon between the french ministry of health and the efs  however  a budget for adopting pathogen inactivation technologies must be established before we would expect broad commercial adoption of the platelet and plasma systems in france 
we maintain a wholly owned subsidiary  cerus europe bv  headquartered in the netherlands  which focuses its efforts on marketing and selling the intercept blood system in europe  russia  the middle east 
table of contents and selected countries in other regions around the world 
we also have a small scientific affairs group that supports the commercialization efforts 
competition we believe that the intercept blood system has certain competitive advantages over competing blood borne pathogen inactivation methods that are either on the market  or in development 
the intercept blood system is designed for use in blood centers  which allows for integration with current blood collection  processing and storage procedures 
certain competing products currently on the market  such as solvent detergent treated plasma  use centralized processing that takes blood products away from the blood center 
one competitor has recently received a ce mark for a pathogen inactivation system for the treatment of platelets and plasma in blood centers 
other competitors are marketing pathogen inactivation products or systems for treating donated plasma in europe 
there are no known competitors in the clinical development stage for pathogen inactivation of red blood cells  though one competitor has initiated a study on pathogen inactivation of whole blood 
in addition to direct competition from other pathogen inactivation methods  we encounter indirect competition from other approaches to blood safety  including methods of testing blood products for bacterial and viral pathogens 
further discussion of the major competitors to our blood product business can be found in the risk factor entitled if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective than our products and product candidates  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated 
if competitors encounter difficulties or failures in human clinical trials or in commercial settings  we may face additional clinical  regulatory  and commercial challenges 
we believe that the primary competitive factors in the market for pathogen inactivation of blood products will include the breadth and effectiveness of pathogen inactivation processes  the amount of demonstrated reduction in transfusion related adverse events subsequent to adopting pathogen inactivation technology  robustness of treated blood components upon transfusion  ease of use  the scope and enforceability of patent or other proprietary rights  product value  product supply and marketing and sales capability 
in addition  the length of time required for products to be developed and to receive regulatory and  in some cases  reimbursement approval are also important competitive factors 
we believe that the intercept blood system will compete favorably with respect to these factors  although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
the medical device and biopharmaceutical field is characterized by rapid and significant technological change 
accordingly  our success will depend in part on our ability to respond quickly to medical and technological changes through the development and introduction of new products 
product development involves a high degree of risk  and there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will result in any commercially successful products 
patents  licenses and proprietary rights our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents  to protect trade secrets  to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by  among other methods  filing united states and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
as of december   we owned approximately issued or allowed united states patents and approximately issued or allowed foreign patents related to the intercept blood system 
our patents expire at various dates between and in addition  we have pending united states patent applications and have filed corresponding patent applications under the patent cooperation treaty 
we have a license from fenwal to united states and foreign patents relating to the intercept blood system  which expire between to proprietary rights relating to our planned and potential products will be protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
there can be no assurance that any patents owned by or licensed to us will afford protection against competitors or that any pending patent applications now or hereafter filed by  or licensed to  us will result in patents being issued 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 

table of contents seasonality our business is dependent on the marketing and commercialization of the intercept blood system to customers such as blood banks  hospitals  distributors and other health care providers that have a need for a pathogen inactivation system to treat blood products for transfusion 
since our customer s needs are not based on seasonal trends  seasonality does not have a material effect on our business 
inventory requirements and product return rights our platelet and plasma systems have received regulatory approval for two year shelf lives 
illuminators and replacement parts do not have regulated expiration dates 
we own work in process inventory for certain components of intercept disposable kits  finished intercept disposable kits  illuminators  and certain replacement parts for our illuminators 
our supply chain for certain of these components  held as work in process on our balance sheet  can take over one year for production to be complete before being utilized in finished disposable kits 
inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market value  determined on a first in  first out basis 
we use significant judgment to analyze and determine if the composition of our inventory is obsolete  slow moving  or unsalable 
our limited history selling the intercept blood system limits the amount of historical data we have to perform such analysis 
generally  we write down specifically identified obsolete  slow moving  or known unsalable inventory using a number of factors including product expiration dates  open and unfulfilled orders  forecasts  and inventory turnover 
we sell the intercept blood system directly to blood banks  hospitals  universities  and government agencies  as well as to distributors in certain regions 
generally  our contracts with our customers do not provide for open return rights  except within a reasonable time after receipt of goods in the case of defective product 
customers at december   the company had three customers each accounting for more than of the company s outstanding trade receivables and aggregating approximately of outstanding trade receivables 
to date  the company has not experienced collection difficulties from these customers 
research and development expenses a significant portion of our operating expenses is related to research and development and we intend to maintain our strong commitment to research and development 
see item a financial statements of this annual report on form k for costs and expenses related to research and development  and other financial information for fiscal years   and government regulation we and our products are comprehensively regulated in the united states by the fda and  in some instances  by state and local governments  and by comparable governmental authorities in other countries 
our european investigational plan has been based on the intercept blood system being categorized as class iii drug device combinations under the medical device directives  or the mdd  of the european union 
the european union requires that medical devices affix the ce mark  an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with the mdd 
the intercept blood system for platelets received the ce mark in october the intercept blood system for plasma received the ce mark in november a separate ce mark certification must be received for the red blood cell system to be sold in the european union and in other countries recognizing the ce mark 
several countries require additional in country studies to support an approval to market products beyond the ce marks 
the fda regulates drugs  medical devices and biologics under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act and other laws  including  in the case of biologics  the public health service act 
these laws and implementing 
table of contents regulations govern  among other things  the development  testing  manufacturing  record keeping  storage  labeling  advertising  promotion and pre market clearance or approval of products subject to regulation 
the steps required before a medical device may be approved for marketing in the united states pursuant to a pre market approval application  or pma  include preclinical laboratory and animal tests submission to the fda of an investigational device exemption for human clinical testing  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  appropriate tests to show the product s safety  adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the product s safety and efficacy for its intended indications  submission to the fda of a pma  and fda review of the pma in order to determine  among other things  whether the product is safe and effective for its intended uses 
in addition  the fda inspects the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice or quality system regulation requirements is satisfactory 
the fda will require a pma for each of the intercept systems for platelets  plasma and red blood cells 
in addition  the fda will require site specific licenses from our united states based blood center customers before they can engage in interstate transport of blood components processed using our pathogen inactivation systems  and a delay in obtaining these licenses would adversely impact our ability to sell products in the united states 
the fda regulates the intercept blood system as a biological medical device 
the fda center for biologics evaluation and research  or cber  is principally responsible for regulating the intercept blood system 
in addition to regulating our blood safety products  cber also regulates the blood collection centers and the blood products they prepare using the intercept blood system 
before the fda determines whether to approve our blood safety products  we expect our approval applications to be reviewed by the blood products advisory committee  or bpac  an advisory committee convened by and reporting to the fda 
bpac will make a recommendation to the fda for  or against  approval 
before a medical device may be marketed in the united states  the fda must approve a pre market approval application for the product 
baxter used a modular process for our pma application for the platelet system in the united states  which we have followed since assuming responsibility for regulatory activities in the united states under terms of the february and agreements 
the content  order and submission timing of the modules must be approved by the fda  and a modular pma application cannot be approved until all modules have been submitted to  reviewed by and accepted by the fda 
in addition to the regulatory requirements applicable to the intercept blood system  there are regulatory requirements applicable to our prospective customers  the blood centers that process and distribute blood and blood products 
blood centers and others will likely be required to obtain approved license supplements from the fda before using the intercept blood system 
there can be no assurance that any blood centers will be able to obtain the required licenses on a timely basis  or at all 
to support applications for regulatory approval to market the intercept blood system  we conduct various types of studies  including toxicology studies to evaluate product safety  laboratory and animal studies to evaluate product effectiveness and human clinical trials to evaluate the safety  tolerability and effectiveness of treated blood components 
we believe that  in deciding whether the intercept blood system is safe and 
table of contents effective  regulatory authorities are likely to take into account whether it adversely affects the therapeutic efficacy of blood components as compared to the therapeutic efficacy of blood components not treated with the system  and regulatory authorities will weigh the system s safety  including potential toxicities of the inactivation compounds  and other risks against the benefits of using the system in a blood supply that has become safer 
we have conducted many toxicology studies designed to demonstrate the intercept blood system s safety 
there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will not require further toxicology or other studies of our products 
based on discussions with the fda and european regulatory authorities  we believe that data from human clinical studies is required to demonstrate the safety of treated blood components and their therapeutic comparability to untreated blood components  but that only data from laboratory and animal studies  not data from human clinical studies  will be required to demonstrate the system s efficacy in inactivating pathogens 
in light of these criteria  our clinical trial programs for the intercept blood system consist of studies that differ from typical phase i  phase ii and phase iii clinical studies 
the intercept blood system for red blood cells preclinical and clinical studies have been conducted using prototype system disposables and devices 
we have or plan to perform laboratory studies to demonstrate equivalency between the prototype and the commercial configuration 
we cannot be certain that these studies will be successful or the fda or foreign regulatory bodies will not require additional studies  which could delay commercialization 
if we decide to seek fda approval of the platelet system for use in treating pooled random donor platelets  additional clinical studies will be required 
in addition  there currently are three principal manufacturers of automated apheresis platelet collection equipment  including fenwal 
the equipment of each manufacturer collects platelets into plastic disposables designed for that equipment  thus  a pathogen inactivation system designed for disposables used by one manufacturer will not necessarily be compatible with other manufacturers collection equipment 
if we pursue regulatory approval of the platelet system in the united states  we may initially seek limited approval of the platelet system configured for fenwal s apheresis collection equipment 
if we determine that compatibility with other equipment is desirable  additional processing procedures and system configurations will need to be developed 
we believe that the fda will also require supplemental clinical data before approving our system for use with platelets collected using other equipment 
health care reimbursement and reform the future revenue and profitability of biopharmaceutical and related companies as well as the availability of capital to such companies may be affected by the continuing efforts of the united states and foreign governments and third party payors to contain or reduce costs of health care through various means 
in the united states  given federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care  it is likely that the united states congress and state legislatures will continue to focus on health care reform and the cost of pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the medicare and medicaid systems 
our ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of the products and related treatment are obtained from governmental authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as hmos 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceuticals  medical devices and services 
the trend toward managed health care in the united states and other countries and the concurrent growth of organizations such as hmos  which could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products  as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs  may all affect the prices for our products and our profitability 
employees as of december   we had employees  of whom were engaged in research and development and in selling  general  and administrative activities 
of the employees engaged in selling  general  and administrative activities  were employed by our european subsidiary  cerus europe bv none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

risk factors risk factors our business faces significant risks 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs  our business may suffer  the trading price of our common stock could decline and our financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this report 
there may be additional risks faced by our business 
if we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our future operations  we will need to curtail planned development or sales and commercialization activities 
our near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors  including operating costs and working capital investments associated with commercializing the intercept blood system  costs associated with planning and conducting studies and clinical trials of our platelet and red blood cell systems  timing and magnitude of payments under grants from the united states government  and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending our intellectual property 
our long term capital requirements will also be dependent on competitive developments and regulatory factors 
until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and generate positive net cash flows from operations  meeting our long term capital requirements is in large part subject to access to public and private equity and debt capital markets  as well as to additional collaborative arrangements with partners or government grants  augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances and short term investments 
we believe that we will be able to make reductions in our operating expenses and inventory  which  together with our expected revenues  will result in sufficient capital to fund operations into if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
we may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth on terms that may include restrictive covenants  including covenants that restrict the operation of our business  liens on assets  high effective interest rates and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by current economic conditions  including the effects of the recent disruptions to the credit and financial markets in the united states and worldwide 
in addition  our independent registered public accountants have indicated that our recurring operating losses raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
this opinion may make it more difficult for us to raise funds when needed 
as a result of these and other factors  we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will be able to obtain additional capital on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we are unable to raise additional capital due to the recent disruptions to the credit and financial markets in the united states and worldwide or other factors  we will need to curtail planned development and commercialization activities 
we expect to prioritize continued commercialization of the platelet and plasma systems in europe  russia  the middle east and in selected countries in other regions around the world over pursuit of regulatory approval of the platelet system in the united states and development and commercialization of the red blood cell system 

table of contents historically  we had received significant awards in funding under cooperative agreements with the dod 
we also received funding under grants from the national institutes of health  largely in support of the immunotherapy business that we spun off in late further funding awarded under federal grants and cooperative agreements for the intercept blood systems may decline when compared to historic levels 
it is subject to the authorization of funds and approval of our research plans by various organizations within the federal government  including the united states congress 
the general economic environment  coupled with tight federal budgets  has led to a general decline in the amount of government funding 
additionally  we no longer are deemed to be a small business for purposes of being eligible for certain grants administered by the national institutes of health and regulated by small business administration 
historically  a significant portion of our grant revenue came from awards surrounding our former immunotherapy business 
if we are unable to obtain federal grant and cooperative agreement funding for future research and development activities at levels similar to past funding  we may need to reduce our operating expenses  which would delay progress in some of our development programs 
in addition  we are required separately to administer and account for our work under government contracts and grants on an on going basis as a condition to accepting government funding  which places administrative  accounting and reporting burdens on us beyond those we have assumed as a public company 
if we fail to comply with applicable governmental administrative  accounting and reporting regulations with respect to these grants and cooperative agreements  funds currently available to us may be reduced or lost 
these conditions may also result in increased selling  general  and administrative spending beyond what we have experienced 
our independent registered public accountants have indicated that our recurring operating losses raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended december   were prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the going concern basis of presentation assumes that we will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
however  our independent registered public accountants have indicated that our recurring operating losses raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
we may be forced to reduce our operating expenses and raise additional funds to meet our working capital needs  principally through the additional sales of our securities or debt financings 
however  we cannot guarantee that will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds  if available  will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to us 
in the event that these plans cannot be effectively realized  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue as a going concern 
our declining creditworthiness may make us unable to obtain additional funds through debt financings  which will impair our ability to continue as a going concern our lack of sufficient revenues to meet our working capital needs has caused our creditworthiness to decline 
as a result  we may be unable to raise additional funds through debt financings or  if we are able to raise such funds  we may not be able to do so on terms satisfactory to us 
if we fail to generate operating income or raise additional funds through sales of our securities or debt financings  we may not be able to continue as a going concern 
we have only a limited operating history  and we expect to continue to generate losses 
we may never achieve a profitable level of operations 
our development and selling  general  and administrative expenses have resulted in substantial losses each year since our inception with the exception of the year ended december  at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
except for sales of the platelet and plasma systems  we have not received significant revenue from product revenue 
the platelet and plasma systems are not yet approved in the united states or in many other countries around the world 
the red blood cell system is in early stage clinical development and may never emerge from the clinical development stage as a marketed product 
we may be required to reduce the sales price 
table of contents for our products in order to make our products economically attractive to our customers and to governmental and private payors  which would reduce and may eliminate our gross profit on sales 
pricing levels may differ widely from country to country  depending on economic  social and industry practices specific to each country 
at our present low unit sales levels of the platelet and plasma systems  our costs to manufacture  distribute  market  sell  support and administer the systems are in excess of revenue 
we may be unable to increase sales to a level sufficient to generate profit contribution 
because the contracts with large  public sector customers  such as the efs  for the intercept blood system may not be confidential due to the public tender process  their terms may set contractual precedents that would not be acceptable to us if applied to contracts with our other customers 
historically  we received substantially all of our revenue from our agreements with our development partners and from federal research grants and cooperative agreements and were required to conduct significant research  development  clinical testing and regulatory compliance activities for each of these products 
contribution from product sales is unlikely to exceed the costs we incur in research  development  and commercialization of the intercept blood system for the foreseeable future 
we expect our losses to continue at least until the intercept blood system is commercialized more broadly and achieves more significant market acceptance 
costs of developing and testing the red blood cell system in later stage human clinical trials will extend the period during which we expect to operate at a loss 
our investment portfolio may become impaired by further deterioration of the capital markets 
our cash equivalent and short term investment portfolio as of december   consisted primarily of high credit  high liquidity united states government agency securities  asset backed securities  corporate debt securities  money market funds and interest bearing accounts with financial institutions 
we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor  manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk 
as a result of current adverse financial market conditions  investments in some financial instruments  such as structured investment vehicles  sub prime mortgage backed securities  auction rate securities and collateralized debt obligations  may pose risks arising from liquidity and credit concerns 
we have limited holdings of these investments in our portfolio  however  the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets have negatively affected investments in many industries  including those in which we invest 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized other than temporary impairments for certain investments in our portfolio totaling million and million  respectively 
the current global economic crisis has had  and may continue to have  a negative impact on the market values of the investments in our investment portfolio

the intercept blood system may not achieve broad market acceptance 
we may encounter governmental and blood banking community resistance to commercial adoption for any or all of our products 
some potential customers may await further safety information or additional studies before choosing whether to adopt our products 
in addition to blood banks  our direct customers  we must also address issues and concerns from broad constituencies involved in the healthcare system  from patients who may ultimately benefit from intercept treated blood components  to transfusing physicians  hospitals  private and public sector payors  regulatory bodies and public health authorities 
any one of these constituencies may be able to delay or block adoption of the intercept blood system 
we may be unable to adequately demonstrate to these constituencies that the intercept blood system is safe  efficacious and cost effective 
for logistical and financial reasons  the transfusion industry has not always integrated new technologies into its processes  even those with the potential to improve the safety of the blood supply  such as the intercept blood system 
our products may require significant changes to our potential customers blood component 
table of contents collection methods  space and staffing requirements and potential customers may not believe that the benefits of using the intercept blood system justify their additional cost 
there is some loss of platelets as a result of our pathogen inactivation process 
if the loss of platelets leads to increased costs  or our process requires changes in blood center or clinical regimens  customers may not adopt our platelet system 
certain studies have indicated that transfusion of conventionally prepared platelets may yield higher post transfusion platelet counts according to a measurement called corrected count increment than transfusion of intercept treated platelets 
while studies also demonstrate that intercept treated platelets retain therapeutic function comparable to conventional platelets  customers may choose not to adopt our platelet system due to considerations relating to corrected count increment 
our products do not inactivate all known pathogens  and the inability of our systems to inactivate certain pathogens  including prions  may limit their acceptance 
in addition  our products may not demonstrate economic value sufficient to offset their price  imposing a financial burden on the healthcare system that may limit market acceptance 
in addition  we have developed  but have not yet received an expanded label claim for a configuration of our platelet system that may make it compatible with the common practice of collecting two units of platelets from a single apheresis donor 
we may need to develop new product configurations to address market needs  which may be technically challenging  expensive and negatively affect potential contribution from product sales 
if customers experience operational or technical problems with the use of intercept blood system products  market acceptance may be reduced 
for example  if adverse events arise from incomplete inactivation of pathogens  improper processing or user error  or if testing of intercept treated blood samples fails to reliably confirm pathogen inactivation  whether or not directly attributable to a shortcoming of the intercept blood system  customers may refrain from purchasing the products 
market acceptance of our products may also be affected by blood center budgets and the availability of reimbursement from governments  managed care payors  such as insurance companies  or other third parties 
in many cases  due to the structure of the blood products industry  we will have little control over budget and reimbursement discussions  which generally occur between blood centers and national or regional ministries of health and private payors 
even if a particular blood center is prepared to adopt the intercept blood system  its hospital customers may not accept  or may not have the budget to purchase  intercept treated blood products 
it is difficult to predict the reimbursement status of newly approved  novel medical device products 
in certain foreign markets  governments have issued regulations relating to the pricing and profitability of medical products and medical products companies 
there also have been proposals in the united states  at both the federal and state government level  to implement similar controls 
the widespread adoption of managed care in the united states has also placed downward pressure on the pricing of medical products 
these pressures can be expected to continue and may limit the prices we can obtain for our products 
product revenue in europe and other regions may be negatively affected because we do not have fda approval for any of our products 
in addition  failure to gain approval or achieve widespread product adoption in key european countries for reasons within and outside our control may limit adoption in other countries 
if the intercept blood system products fail to achieve market acceptance  we may never become profitable 
the market for the intercept blood system is highly concentrated with few customers  including often dominant regional or national blood collection entities 
even if our products receive regulatory approval and reimbursement is available  failure to properly market  promote  distribute  price or sell our products to any of these large customers could significantly diminish potential product revenue in those geographies 
the market for our pathogen inactivation systems in the united states is highly concentrated  dominated by a small number of blood collection organizations 
in many countries in western europe and in japan  various national blood transfusion services or red cross organizations collect  store and distribute virtually all of their respective nations blood and blood components supply 
in europe  the largest markets for our products are in england  germany and france 
decisions on product adoption in england are centralized with the national blood service 
in germany  decisions on product adoption and subsequent reimbursement are expected to be on a regional or even blood center by blood center basis  but depend on both local and centralized regulatory approval from the paul ehrlich institute  or pei 
product characteristics relating to platelet dose in any final pei marketing authorization of intercept treated platelets may be incompatible with market requirements 
while 
table of contents intercept treated platelets and plasma have received in country regulatory approval and reimbursement rates have been established in france  adoption throughout france has been delayed 
blood center economics in certain european countries  including germany and the united kingdom  may require that we develop disposable kit configurations of the platelet system that treat larger volumes of platelets  which would serve to reduce the number of kits we might sell to address market demand in those countries  even though our selling price and margin might be higher on such disposable kit configurations 
the japanese red cross controls a significant majority of blood transfusions in japan and exerts a high degree of influence on the adoption and use of blood safety measures in japan 
the japanese red cross has been reviewing preclinical and clinical data on pathogen inactivation of blood over a number of years and has yet to make a formal determination to adopt the intercept blood system or any other competitive approach 
if approvals are not obtained to market our products in these countries  or if the products are not adopted in these countries  our potential product revenue will be significantly decreased 
our products  blood products treated with the intercept blood system and we are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign authorities 
if our preclinical and clinical data are not considered sufficient by regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval  we will be unable to commercialize our products and generate revenue 
our red blood cell system requires extensive additional testing and development 
our products  both those sold commercially and those under development  are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by local  state and federal regulatory authorities in the united states and by foreign regulatory bodies 
these regulations are wide ranging and govern  among other things development  testing  manufacturing  labeling  storage  pre market clearance or approval  sales and distribution  use standards and documentation  post launch surveillance  quality  advertising and promotion  and reimbursement 
clinical trials in particular are expensive and have a high risk of failure 
any of our product candidates may fail in the testing phase or may not achieve results sufficient to attain market acceptance  which could prevent us from achieving profitability 
we do not know whether we will begin and conduct planned clinical trials on schedule  if at all 
significant delays in clinical testing could materially impact our clinical trials 
we also do not know whether planned clinical trials will need to be revamped or will be completed on schedule  if at all 
criteria for regulatory approval in blood safety indications are evolving with competitive advances in the standard of care against which new product candidates are judged  as well as with changing market needs and reimbursement levels 
clinical trial design  including enrollment criteria  endpoints  and anticipated label claims are thus subject to change  even if original objectives are being met 
in addition to the reasons stated above  clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons  including delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a study  delays in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical study agreement terms with prospective clinical sites  delays in 
table of contents obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a study at a prospective clinical site and delays in recruiting subjects to participate in a study 
we do not know whether any clinical trials will result in marketable products 
typically  there is a high rate of failure for product candidates in preclinical and clinical trials and product emerging from any successful trials would not reach the market for several years 
it may take us several years to complete our clinical testing  and failure can occur at any stage of testing 
enrollment criteria for certain of our clinical trials may be quite narrow 
consequently  we may be unable to recruit suitable patients into the trial on a timely basis  if at all 
we cannot rely on interim results of trials to predict their final results  and acceptable results in early trials might not be repeated in later trials 
any trial may fail to produce results satisfactory to the fda or foreign regulatory authorities 
in addition  preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
negative or inconclusive results from a preclinical study or clinical trial or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a preclinical study or clinical trial to be repeated  require other studies to be performed or cause a program to be terminated  even if other studies or trials relating to a program are successful 
the fda and other agencies in the united states and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the manufacturing and marketing of products such as those we are developing 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is long  expensive and uncertain  and typically takes a number of years  depending on the type  complexity and novelty of the product 
in addition  we may be required to obtain approval from the food and drug branch of the california state department of health for any product manufactured by us in california  including for clinical trial use 
we may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in our efforts to secure necessary approvals or licenses  or we may not be successful at all 
we have received ce mark approval and in country regulatory approvals for the intercept platelet and plasma systems  which allow us to sell our platelet and plasma systems only in certain countries  mainly in europe  russia  the middle east  and asia 
we have not received regulatory approval for commercial sale of the intercept blood system in the united states and many other countries around the world 
our products are in various stages of development and regulatory approval  and we face the risks of failure inherent in developing medical devices and biotechnology products based on new technologies 
our products must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy and we must adhere to quality standards regarding manufacturing and customer facing business processes before the fda and international regulatory authorities can approve them for commercial use 
we must provide the fda and international regulatory authorities with preclinical  clinical and manufacturing data demonstrating that our products are safe  effective and in compliance with government regulations before the products can be approved for commercial sale 
we will need to complete validation studies and obtain in country regulatory approvals and gain national reimbursement in certain european countries before we can market and sell our products in those countries 
before the fda determines whether to approve the intercept blood system products  we expect our approval applications to be reviewed by the blood products advisory committee  or bpac 
bpac would then make a recommendation to the fda for  or against  approval 
even if bpac were to recommend approval of one or more of our products  the fda would not necessarily approve those products 
if bpac were to recommend against approval of one or more of our products  it is likely that the fda would not approve those products 
if our product candidates receive approval for commercial sale  their marketing and manufacturing will be subject to continuing fda and other regulatory requirements  such as requirements to comply with good manufacturing practice and iso  a quality management system standard applicable to the products we sell in europe 
the failure to comply with these requirements on an ongoing basis could result in delaying or precluding commercialization efforts in certain geographies  including the united states  and could result in enforcement action  which could harm our business 
the current manufacturing sites we rely upon for producing the platelet and plasma system products for international distribution and sale are not fda qualified facilities 
regulatory authorities may also require post marketing testing  which can involve significant expense 
governments or regulatory authorities may impose new regulations or other changes or we may discover that we are subject to additional regulations that could further delay or preclude regulatory approval and subsequent adoption of our 
table of contents potential products 
we cannot predict the impact of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action 
distribution of our products in markets outside the united states also is subject to extensive government regulation 
these regulations vary by country  including the requirements for approvals or clearance to market  the time required for regulatory review and the sanctions imposed for violations 
in some countries  we may be required to register as a medical device manufacturer  even though we outsource manufacturing to third parties 
in addition to ce mark documentation  countries outside the european union may require clinical data submissions  registration packages  import licenses or other documentation with which we have little or no familiarity 
in may  we obtained a ce mark extension in our name from european union regulators for our platelet system  originally obtained by baxter in  and will need to obtain an extension every five years 
in addition to european union level approval  we must obtain regulatory and reimbursement approvals in some individual european countries to market our products 
we may also be required to conduct additional testing in order to obtain regulatory approval in countries that do not recognize the ce mark as being adequate for commercializing the intercept blood system in those countries 
the level of additional product testing varies by country  but could be expensive or take a long time to complete 
failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in lost product revenue and profitability 
in addition  regulatory agencies are able to withdraw or suspend previously issued approvals 
for example  we recently received notice from health canada that the license for the platelet system that was issued to baxter had been suspended until such time as we can supply health canada with additional data to meet its requirements 
we completed our phase iii clinical trial of the platelet system in the united states in march and submitted data from this trial  along with several other modules of our pre market approval application  to the fda 
based on discussions with the fda  we performed an additional blinded analysis of the clinical trial data  under the direction of an independent expert physician panel  to determine if apparent differences between treatment groups in the category of pulmonary adverse events reported in the study were attributable to inconsistent event reporting 
the reassessment of primary patient records by the expert physician panel showed no statistically significant differences between groups 
this reassessment differed from the earlier analysis of adverse events that was based on clinical trial case report forms  which showed statistically significant differences in specific pulmonary events 
we submitted a report of the analysis to the fda for review 
we have had several interactions with the fda subsequent to the final report submission 
we understand that our reassessment of our previously completed phase iii clinical trial data will not be sufficient to address the apparent differences observed in that trial between the treatment groups in the category of pulmonary adverse events 
based upon further discussions with the fda following submission of that report  we understand that the fda may consider non randomized  unblinded  and noncontrolled data gathered from monitoring patients transfused with intercept treated platelets in the context of standard medical practice in conjunction with data from the previously completed phase iii trials 
we understand that the design of such a study would be novel and resulting data may not be sufficient to approximate the quality of similar data that could be expected from a randomized  blinded  and controlled phase iii clinical trial 
such data will need to be gathered prospectively and must be in a form and substance deemed acceptable to the fda in its sole discretion 
there is no assurance that we will be able to reach agreement with the fda on the data to be collected and endpoints to be monitored  that transfusing physicians with patients in the study will adhere to post diagnostic medical procedures that may be mandated in the agreed upon study protocol  that we will be able to collect such data  or that the fda will find such data from commercial use adequate to answer questions that the fda has concerning the safety and efficacy of the platelet system 
we may conclude that the cost of gathering such data or the time required to do so is too great or that gathering such data is not logistically achievable 
the fda may not find the data from standard medical practice in europe to be acceptable for approval in the united states 
as a result  the fda may still require a larger  randomized  blinded clinical trial than we and baxter completed in before a product license application can be finalized and the platelet system considered for approval in the united states 

table of contents such an additional phase iii trial would have to be designed to demonstrate no greater frequency in the incidence of such adverse events relative to a control group on a statistically significant basis 
the dimensions of such a phase iii trial may be prohibitively large due either to prospective cost  logistics or both 
the additional european study or phase iii clinical trial will need to be completed and data submitted to the fda before we can complete our regulatory submission 
in addition  the fda will require that certain manufacturing and distribution facilities operated by the third parties with whom we contract to produce the platelet system be compliant with good manufacturing practice  or gmp  regulations and quality system regulations  or qsr  before the fda would consider the applications for approval 
we have completed phase iiia  phase iiib and phase iiic clinical trials of the plasma system  in the united states  reports for which were filed with the fda during we obtained a ce mark approval in europe of the plasma system in november and final french approval in may based on data from those trials of the plasma system 
we have not submitted any applications for regulatory approval of the plasma system in the united states or any other regions other than europe 
in some countries  including several in europe  we or our customers may be required to perform additional clinical studies or submit manufacturing and marketing applications in order to obtain regulatory approval 
we have conducted many toxicology studies to demonstrate the intercept platelet and plasma systems safety  and we have conducted and plan to conduct toxicology studies for the intercept red blood cell system throughout the product development process 
at any time  the fda and other regulatory authorities may require further toxicology or other studies to further demonstrate our products safety  which could delay commercialization 
in addition  the fda or foreign regulatory authorities may alter guidance at any time as to what constitutes acceptable clinical trial endpoints or trial design  which may necessitate our having to redesign our product or proposed clinical trials and cause us to incur substantial additional expense or time in attempting to gain regulatory approval 
we believe the fda and other regulatory authorities are likely to weigh the potential risks of using our pathogen inactivation products against the incremental benefits  which may be less compelling in light of improved safety in the blood supply 
we expect the fda to require us to demonstrate a very low level of potential side effects in non randomized data from standard medical practice in europe or in additional randomized phase iii trials of the platelet system we may conduct in the united states or elsewhere 
trials of this type may be too large and expensive to be practical 
as a result of the termination of phase iii clinical trials of our red blood cell system due to the detection of antibody reactivity to red blood cells treated with the intercept red blood cell system in one patient in the chronic arm of the trials  we have been conducting additional research activities on our red blood cell system to determine if the system can be reconfigured to reduce the potential for antibody reactivity to treated red blood cells 
based upon an internal evaluation of the results from these additional research activities and after consulting with regulatory authorities  we initiated a new phase i trial in in the united states using a modified red blood cell system before potentially progressing to later stage clinical trials 
we utilized a manual processing system in the phase i trial conducted in  which system is not in a commercially feasible form 
results of the phase i trial suggested that the modified process in combination with a conventional additive solution results in conditions not suitable for long term storage of red blood cells treated with the intercept system  adversely impacting their lifespan 
consequently  we conducted in vitro and in vivo studies and initiated a new phase i clinical trial in the fourth quarter of to test further modifications to the red blood cell system 
a number of trial design  process and product design issues that could impact efficacy  regulatory approval and market acceptance will need to be resolved prior to the initiation of further clinical trials 
while those clinical trials are being conducted and further clinical work is planned  including determining the appropriate design of additional phase i  subsequent phase ii clinical trials  if deemed necessary  and phase iii clinical trials  we will need to develop a commercially feasible red blood cell system  including disposables  hardware and software for implementing the process in blood collection centers 
in the aggregate  these activities will require significant funding beyond our current resources 
we will not commence the next phase of activities until we have secured adequate funds 
we expect that we can continue some level of program advancement on a cash neutral basis with grant funding from the department of defense and existing and potential partners 
a delay in completing such 
table of contents activities could result in a delay in the timely progression to later stage trials 
if we are unsuccessful in advancing a modified red blood cell system through clinical trials  resolving process and product design issues or in obtaining subsequent regulatory approvals and acceptable reimbursement rates  we may never realize a return on our development expenses incurred to date in the red blood cell system program 
regulatory delays can also materially impact our product development costs 
if we experience delays in testing  conducting trials or approvals  our product development costs will increase 
for example  we may need to repeat clinical trials to address regulatory or clinical questions 
we may also need to retain third party investigators and organizations in an attempt to facilitate regulatory review and approval 
if the delays are significant  our financial results and the commercial prospects for our products will be harmed  and our ability to become profitable will be delayed 
regulatory agencies may limit the uses  or indications  for which any of our products are approved 
for example  we believe that the intercept blood system products will be able to claim the inactivation of particular pathogens only to the extent we have laboratory data to support such claims 
after regulatory approval for the initial indications  further studies may be necessary to gain approval for the use of the product for additional indications 
in addition to the regulatory requirements applicable to us and to our products  there are regulatory requirements in several countries around the world  including the united states  germany  canada  and australia  and other countries  applicable to our prospective customers of intercept blood system products  the blood centers that process and distribute blood and blood products 
in those countries  blood centers and other customers will be required to obtain approved license supplements from the appropriate regulatory authorities in each country before making available blood products processed with our pathogen inactivation systems to hospitals and transfusing physicians 
for example  our customers in germany must obtain separate regulatory approvals to manufacture and sell blood components treated with the intercept blood system 
our customers may lack the resources or capability to obtain such regulatory approvals 
these requirements or regulators delays in approving license applications or supplements may deter some blood centers from using our products 
blood centers that do submit applications or supplements for manufacturing and sale may face disapproval or delays in approval that could provide further delay or deter them from using our products 
the regulatory impact on potential customers could slow or limit the potential sales of our products 
we have limited experience operating a commercial organization 
we rely on third parties to market  sell  and distribute our products and to maintain customer relationships in a number of foreign countries 
since february  we have been fully responsible for sales  marketing  distribution and regulatory support of the intercept blood system worldwide  except in those asian territories covered by our agreements with bioone for the platelet and plasma systems 
we no longer rely upon baxter or fenwal for these activities 
if we fail in our efforts to develop or maintain such internal competencies or establish acceptable relationships with third parties on a timely basis  our attempts to commercialize the intercept blood system may be irreparably harmed 
we operate a small organization  headquartered in the netherlands dedicated primarily to selling and marketing the platelet and plasma systems in geographies where the intercept platelet and plasma systems are approved 
we will need to maintain and continue to increase our competence in a number of functions  including sales  marketing  regulatory  inventory and logistics  customer service  credit and collections  risk management  and quality assurance systems 
many of these competencies require compliance with eu and local standards and practices  with which we have limited experience 
we have entered into contracts  generally on a geographically exclusive basis  with distributors in countries where we have limited abilities to commercialize our pathogen inactivation products directly 
we have entered into national distribution agreements in spain  portugal and chile  russia  poland  greece  and kuwait  as well as regional distribution agreements in italy 
we rely on these distributors to market and sell the intercept 
table of contents blood system  obtain any necessary in country regulatory approvals beyond the ce marks  provide customer support  maintain inventories  and adhere to our quality system in all material respects  among other activities 
while our contracts generally require distributors to exercise diligence  these distributors may fail to commercialize the intercept blood system in their respective territories or may do so on terms which are not economic to us 
they may fail to sell product inventory they have purchased from us to end customers 
initial purchases of uva illuminators or disposable kits by these third parties may not lead to follow on purchases of disposable platelet and plasma system kits 
we have limited visibility into the identity and requirements of blood banking customers these distributors may have 
these third parties may irreparably harm relationships with local existing and prospective customers and our standing with the blood banking community in general 
we may have little recourse  short of termination  in the event that a distributor fails to execute according to our expectations 
we must develop regulatory capabilities for clinical stage and post approval trials involving the intercept blood system globally 
failure to develop regulatory capabilities in support of international commercialization of the intercept blood system may slow the rate of adoption of the platelet and plasma systems 
we may not have adequate internal resources and capabilities to manage clinical stage and post approval trials and to respond appropriately to possible customer complaints or required regulatory reporting of adverse events arising from the use of the platelet and plasma systems 
we will need to increase our regulatory and trial management resources or contract with independent regulatory consultants  which we may be unable to do on a timely basis 
adding regulatory and trial management resources will result in increased costs and may potentially delay regulatory filings 
delays or inabilities to complete regulatory filings and obtain approvals will also delay or prevent us from being able to recognize sales of our products and attaining profitability 
we rely on third parties for manufacturing and supplying components of our platelet and plasma systems 
we are dependent on fenwal to manufacture disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems through the end of over a longer period  we may need to identify  select and qualify alternate third party sources of supply for the intercept blood system  including the intercept red blood cell system if our agreement with fenwal cannot be extended or broadened 
in march baxter sold its transfusion therapies business  the unit of baxter that has performed many of the manufacturing and supply chain activities related to our relationship with baxter  to a new company  fenwal  inc fenwal has agreed  through an agreement signed with us in december  to manufacture disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems for us through the end of however  fenwal may fail to manufacture an adequate supply of disposable kits and intersol additive solution or to do so on a cost effective basis  which would subject us to loss of revenue and reduced contribution margin 
in addition  because the components of the intercept blood system are manufactured and assembled at multiple facilities owned by both fenwal and baxter leading up to final assembly  fenwal and baxter will remain interdependent with respect to the intercept blood system supply chain 
fenwal and baxter may fail to coordinate or meet interdependent supply chain obligations  leading to a failure to manufacture an adequate supply of components or devices of the intercept blood system  which would also subject us to the risks described below 
we contract with independent suppliers  including nova  for the manufacture of uva illuminators and certain components of the intercept blood system which are manufactured or assembled at facilities not owned by fenwal or baxter 
facilities at which the intercept blood system or its components are manufactured may cease operations for planned or unplanned reasons  causing at least temporary interruptions in supply 
even a temporary failure to supply adequate numbers of intercept blood system components may cause an irreparable loss of customer goodwill 
if we conclude that supply of the intercept blood system or components from fenwal and others is uncertain  we may choose to build and maintain inventories of raw materials  work in process components  or finished goods  which would consume capital resources and may cause our supply chain to be less efficient 
future supply of illuminators is limited to availability of components  some of which are in short supply or are no longer manufactured 
we will be required to redesign the illuminator used in the platelet and plasma systems to manage the risk of obsolete components 
such redesign may be expensive and lead to regulatory delays in obtaining approvals to market the redesigned device 

table of contents fenwal manufactures our platelet and plasma systems in facilities that are not fda approved 
in order to be sold in the united states  our systems would be required to be manufactured in fda approved facilities 
fda validation of manufacturing facilities  whether owned by fenwal or by other parties  will be costly and time consuming 
we will also be dependent on baxter and fenwal to transfer know how relevant to the intercept blood system  however  certain of fenwal s materials  manufacturing processes and methods are proprietary to fenwal or baxter 
we may be unable to establish alternate sources of supply to fenwal without having to redesign certain elements of the platelet and plasma systems 
such redesign may be costly  time consuming and require further regulatory review  which would delay our ability to commercialize the platelet and plasma systems 
fenwal is not obligated to provide support for development and testing of improvements or changes we may make to the intercept blood system 
we may be unable to identify  select  and qualify such manufacturers or those third parties able to provide support for development and testing activities on a timely basis or enter into contracts with them on reasonable terms  if at all 
we have recently contracted directly with third party suppliers of certain components of the platelet and plasma systems which fenwal had used historically in an effort to make the supply of components more reliable  though doing so will increase our investment in raw material and work in process inventories and subject us to minimum purchase requirements 
we understand that a raw material supplier to baxter  which in turn supplies fenwal  for a proprietary plastic used in the platelet and plasma systems disposable kits has ceased production  and that baxter may be unable to identify an alternate supplier on a timely basis  if at all 
raw material and component suppliers may not meet quality specifications we have set  which would cause a disruption in supply and may lead to lost sales and irreparable damage to our customer relationships 
moreover  the inclusion of components manufactured by new suppliers could require us to seek new or updated approvals from regulatory authorities  which could result in delays in product delivery 
we may not receive any such required regulatory approvals 
our potential remedies against fenwal or other manufacturers may be inadequate in assuring that these manufacturing partners meet their contractual obligations 
in the event of a failure by fenwal or other manufacturers to perform their obligations to supply components of the intercept blood system to us  damages recoverable by us may be insufficient to compensate us for the full loss of business opportunity 
our supply agreements with fenwal and nova  and supply agreements with others contain limitations on incidental and consequential damages that we may recover 
a supplier s potential liability in the event of non performance may not be sufficient to compel the supplier to continue to act in conformity with our agreements 
the platelet system is not compatible with some commercial platelet collection methods and platforms and platelet storage solutions 
the equipment and materials used to collect platelets vary by manufacturer and by geographic region 
platelets may be collected from a single donor by apheresis using an automated collection machine 
apheresis devices currently used in the united states and european markets differ  among other characteristics  in their ability to collect platelets in reduced volumes of plasma 
platelet concentrates may also be prepared from whole blood by pooling together platelets from multiple donors 
there are two commonly used methods for preparing whole blood platelets the buffy coat method  which is used extensively in europe  and the pooled random donor method  which is used in the united states and to a more limited extent in europe 
our system for platelets is designed to work with platelets collected using a proprietary platelet storage solution  called intersol  manufactured by fenwal 
for platelets collected by apheresis  the intercept platelet system is most compatible with fenwal s apheresis platelet collection system  because it facilitates the use of intersol 
for platelets prepared from whole blood  our platelet system is most compatible with the buffy coat collection method  again because this method facilitates the use of intersol as an additive solution to the platelet concentrate 
as a result  we have conducted most of our clinical studies using either fenwal s equipment or buffy 
table of contents coat platelets 
more recently  we have begun conducting studies in europe supporting the use of the platelet system in combination with other collection and preparation platforms and with other additive solutions and with platelets suspended in plasma 
we may not be successful in developing data supportive of commercialization using other collection and preparation platforms and with other additive solutions  which would limit customer adoption of the intercept blood system 
fenwal may be required to obtain separate regulatory approval for intersol in the united states and in countries which do not recognize ce mark approval before customers would be permitted to use intersol with the intercept blood system in those countries 
in order to address the entire market in the united states  we would need to develop and test additional configurations of the platelet system 
our efforts to develop the platelet system were initially focused on apheresis platelets collected on fenwal s automated collection platform or using the buffy coat collection method 
we estimate that the majority of platelets used in the united states are collected by apheresis  though a significant minority is prepared from pooled random donor platelets derived from whole blood collections 
in order to gain regulatory approvals for a pathogen inactivation system compatible with random donor platelets  we will need to perform additional product development and testing  including additional clinical trials 
similarly  to achieve market acceptance in certain geographies  we may be required to design  develop and test new product configurations for the platelet and plasma systems 
these development activities would increase our costs significantly  and may not be successful 
fenwal has committed to us to make intersol collection and pooling products and conversion kits available to customers 
however  fenwal may not make such products or its apheresis collection system available for sale in certain countries and has elected to discontinue sales efforts for its apheresis collection system in japan 
other manufacturers supplying blood component collection platforms to the market may resist our efforts to make the intercept blood system compatible with their platforms 
attaining compatibility with collection platforms manufactured by others may require adaptations to either the intercept blood system or to the collection platforms  which may be difficult to engineer  expensive to implement and test  require additional clinical trials  cause delays in regulatory approval and or be commercially unattractive to pursue 
these development activities will increase our costs significantly  and may not be successful 
market acceptance of the intercept blood system may be delayed until the system receives regulatory approval for use on such other equipment  if required 
because the intercept blood system products have not been manufactured on more than a limited commercial scale  we face manufacturing uncertainties that could limit their commercialization 
if our third party manufacturers fail to produce our products or compounds satisfactorily  at acceptable cost and in sufficient quantities  we may incur delays  shortfalls and additional expenses  which may in turn result in permanent harm to our customer relations 
the intercept blood system products  including many of the components  have been manufactured on a commercial scale on only a limited basis 
fenwal relies on third parties  including baxter  to manufacture and assemble some of the platelet and plasma system components  many of which are customized and have not been manufactured on a commercial scale 
fenwal has produced some pathogen inactivation systems in modest commercial quantities  but may not be able to manufacture and assemble other systems or in larger quantities  or do so economically 
because of low sales volumes and other reasons  fenwal s costs to manufacture commercial components for the platelet and plasma systems have been greater than we previously anticipated and may continue to rise 
it is uncertain what effect fenwal s independence from baxter will have on its cost structure or on transfer prices from baxter to fenwal and costs ultimately passed on to us 
these issues may result in reducing our potential gross profit margin from platelet and plasma system sales 
we are in the initial stages of commercializing the intercept blood system and may not accurately forecast demand for the intercept blood system 
we have contracted with third parties to supply platelet and plasma systems and components to meet forecasted demand 
however  such forecasts may prove to be either 
table of contents higher or lower than actual commercial demand 
as a result  we may carry excess work in process or finished goods inventory  which would consume capital resources and may become obsolete  or be inadequate to meet customer demand 
if fenwal or third party manufacturers fail to produce our products or intersol products satisfactorily  at acceptable costs and in sufficient quantities  we may incur delays  shortfalls and additional expenses  which may in turn result in permanent harm to our customer relations 
fenwal and we purchase certain key components of the intercept blood system from a limited number of suppliers 
it would be expensive and time consuming to establish additional or replacement suppliers for these components 
some components of the intercept blood system  including components of the uva illuminator device  are no longer manufactured  which will require fenwal or us to identify and qualify replacement components and may require that we conduct additional studies  which could include clinical trials  to demonstrate equivalency or validate any required design or component changes 
we understand that a raw material supplier to baxter  which in turn supplies fenwal  for a proprietary plastic used in the platelet and plasma systems disposable kits has ceased production  and that baxter may be unable to identify an alternate supplier on a timely basis  if at all 
if fenwal or we are unable to identify and supply replacement components  we may be unable to supply products to our customers 
if we were required to redesign the products  our development costs would increase  and our programs and commercialization efforts could be delayed significantly 
we use third party manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of the chemical compounds used in our products 
we currently do not have any third party manufacturing agreements in place for commercial production of compounds used in our red blood cell system  which is in early stages of clinical development 
any new or additional commercial manufacturer will need to develop new methods and processes to manufacture these compounds on a commercial scale and demonstrate to us  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities that its commercial scale manufacturing processes comply with government regulations and that its compounds are equivalent to originally licensed compounds in order for us to maintain commercial licensure of our products 
it may be difficult or impossible to economically manufacture our products on a commercial scale 
our platelet and plasma systems have received regulatory approval for two year shelf lives 
we and our distributors may be unable to ship product to customers prior to the expiration of product shelf life  which would require that we destroy or consume the outdated inventory in product demonstration activities at our expense 
we have used prototype components in our preclinical studies and clinical trials of the intercept red blood cell system and have not completed the components commercial design 
we will be required to identify and enter into agreements with third parties to manufacture the red blood cell system and related blood component storage solutions 
the system disposables and instruments of our red blood cell system that we used in our preclinical studies and clinical trials in the united states historically and those we are now using in the current phase i red blood cell trial are prototypes of systems to be used in the final products 
as a result  we expect regulatory authorities will require us to perform additional preclinical and clinical studies using the commercial versions of the systems to demonstrate the acceptability of the commercial configuration and the equivalence of the prototypes and the commercial products  which may increase our expenses and delay the commercialization of our products 
we have tested additional modifications of the red blood cell system to improve the lifespan of treated red blood cells 
in vitro and in vivo studies of such modifications to the red blood cell system may not be indicative of red blood cell lifespan in humans 
additional early stage trials will be necessary to determine whether our modifications  including these new approaches  may lead to a product with acceptable commercial characteristics 
we also are assessing whether such modifications would be acceptable clinically  economically and or operationally to potential customers 
we may determine that although the modified red blood cell system may overcome technical issues encountered in the past  it may not be commercially feasible from potential customers perspectives 
if we fail to develop commercial versions of the intercept red blood cell system on schedule  our potential revenue would be delayed or diminished and our potential competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do 

table of contents in addition  the design and engineering effort required to complete the final commercial product will likely be substantial and time consuming 
as with any complex development effort  we expect to encounter design  engineering and manufacturing issues 
such issues have previously arisen  sometimes unexpectedly  and solutions to these issues have not always been readily forthcoming 
additional unforeseen design  engineering and manufacturing issues may arise in the future  which could increase the development cost and delay commercialization of our products 
fenwal is not obligated to provide manufacturing services related to the red blood cell system 
we will need to identify parties to provide those manufacturing services related to our red blood cell system 
it may be difficult to enter into these types of agreements on reasonable terms 
in particular  it will be time consuming for other manufacturers to develop the capability to manufacture the intercept blood system products and blood component storage solutions economically and to gain regulatory approval to do so for commercial use 
we may be unable to identify and contract with manufacturers that can make our products cost effectively  which would delay our efforts to commercialize the red blood cell system  even if we successfully complete clinical development 
bioone may fail to take advantage of commercialization rights for our platelet and plasma systems in many asian countries 
baxter and we have licensed to bioone rights to commercialize the platelet and plasma systems in japan  china  taiwan  south korea  vietnam  thailand  and singapore 
bioone is subject to similar risks in its territories regarding commercialization of the intercept blood system as we are 
bioone is solely responsible for obtaining regulatory approvals  marketing and selling the platelet and plasma systems in countries where it holds licenses to commercialize the intercept platelet and plasma systems 
we understand fenwal has assumed the rights and obligations of baxter with regard to baxter s agreements with bioone 
bioone is dependent on fenwal for the manufacture and supply of the platelet and plasma systems 
bioone may be unable to qualify the platelet and plasma systems for sale in certain countries in its territory 
bioone has made little progress to date in commercializing the platelet and plasma systems in asian territories 
because we only have a minority investment interest in bioone  we lack the ability to significantly influence bioone  and are dependent on bioone s performance to realize milestone and royalty revenue from commercialization of our platelet and plasma systems in those countries 
in japan  regulatory authorities may require our platelet and plasma systems to be widely adopted commercially in europe or approved by the fda before the platelet and plasma systems are considered for approval in japan  which would delay or prevent bioone from achieving significant product revenue 
in july  bioone raised limited additional capital in order to fund curtailed operations 
at these reduced operating levels  we expect that bioone s abilities to commercialize the platelet and plasma systems in its asian territories will be compromised 
there is no assurance that bioone will be able to attract additional required capital in the future to successfully commercialize those products licensed from fenwal and us 
even if bioone fails to commercialize the intercept blood system in its territories  we may be unable to assert contractual rights to regain commercialization rights on satisfactory terms  if at all 
if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective than our products and product candidates  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated 
if competitors encounter difficulties or failures in human clinical trials or in commercial settings  we may face additional clinical  regulatory and commercial challenges 
we expect our products to encounter significant competition 
the intercept blood system products compete with other approaches to blood safety currently in use  and may compete with future products that may be developed by others 
our success will depend in part on our ability to respond quickly to medical and technological changes brought about by the development and introduction of new products 
product development is risky and uncertain  and we cannot assure you that we will develop our products successfully 
competitors 
table of contents products or technologies may make our products obsolete or non competitive before we are able to generate any significant revenue 
in addition  competitors or potential competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have 
they may also have greater experience in preclinical testing  human clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures 
several companies are developing technologies that are  or in the future may be  the basis for products that will directly compete with or reduce the market for our pathogen inactivation systems 
a number of companies are specifically focusing on alternative strategies for pathogen inactivation in platelets and plasma 
competitors in platelet pathogen inactivation may be able to offer customers systems using additive solutions other than intersol  which we use in the intercept platelet system 
in europe  several companies  including grifols sa  octapharma ag and macopharma international  are developing or selling commercial pathogen inactivation systems or services to treat fresh frozen plasma 
caridian is developing a pathogen inactivation system for blood products and has been issued ce marks for a pathogen reduction system for both platelets and plasma 
caridian also commenced trials on a pathogen inactivation system for whole blood  which may offer competitive advantages over our intercept blood system  with its three distinct components for platelets  plasma and red blood cells 
new methods of testing whole blood for specific pathogens have been approved by the fda and in europe  as have tests for bacteria in platelets 
continued delays in commercialization of our platelet and plasma systems in france and germany may impact our ability to compete with bacterial testing for platelets 
other competitors are developing rapid  point of care bacterial tests  synthetic blood product substitutes and products to stimulate the growth of platelets 
development and commercialization of any of these or other related technologies could limit the potential market for our products 
we may be liable and we may need to withdraw our products from the market if our products harm people 
we may be liable if an accident occurs in our controlled use of hazardous materials 
our insurance coverages may be inadequate to offset losses we may incur 
we are exposed to potential liability risks inherent in the testing and marketing of medical devices and pharmaceutical products 
we may be liable if any of our products cause injury  illness or death 
although we will have completed rigorous preclinical and clinical safety testing prior to marketing our products  there may be harmful effects caused by our products that we are unable to identify in preclinical or clinical testing 
in particular  unforeseen  rare reactions or adverse side effects related to long term use of our products may not be observed until the products are in widespread commercial use 
because of the limited duration and number of patients receiving blood components treated with the intercept blood system products in clinical trials  it is possible that harmful effects of our products not observed in clinical and preclinical testing could be discovered after a marketing approval has been received 
later discovery of problems with a product  manufacturer or facility may result in additional restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
we are subject to risks and costs of product recall  which include not only potential out of pocket costs  but also potential interruption to our supply chain 
in such an event  our customer relations would be harmed and we would incur unforeseen losses 
we maintain product liability insurance  but do not know whether the insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including certain hazardous chemicals  radioactive materials and infectious pathogens  such as hiv and hepatitis viruses 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of hazardous materials are adequate and comply with regulatory requirements  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury 
if an accident occurs  we could be held liable for any damages that result 

table of contents virtually all of our research and development activities and the significant majority of our general and administrative activities are performed in or managed from a single site that may be subject to lengthy business interruption in the event of a severe earthquake 
we also may suffer loss of computerized information and may be unable to make timely filings with regulatory agencies in the event of catastrophic failure of our data storage and backup systems 
virtually all of our research and development activities and the significant majority of our general and administrative activities are performed in or managed from our facilities in concord  california  which are within an active earthquake fault zone 
should a severe earthquake occur  we might be unable to occupy our facilities or conduct research and development and general and administrative activities in support of our business and products until such time as our facilities could be repaired and made operational 
our property and casualty and business interruption insurance in general does not cover losses caused by earthquakes 
while we have taken certain measures to protect our scientific  technological and commercial assets  a lengthy or costly disruption due to an earthquake would have a material adverse effect on us 
we have also taken measures to limit damage that may occur from the loss of computerized data due to power outage  system or component failure  or corruption of data files 
however  we may lose critical computerized data  which may be difficult or impossible to recreate  which may harm our business 
we may be unable to make timely filings with regulatory agencies in the event of catastrophic failure of our data storage and backup systems  which may subject us to fines or adverse consequences  up to and including loss of our abilities to conduct business 
we do not anticipate receiving significant economic benefit from the spin off of our immunotherapy business 
in november  we spun off our immunotherapy business to anza 
in exchange for contributed tangible and intangible assets  we received preferred stock representing an equity interest of approximately of anza s preferred equity 
the terms of sale provided anza a right to redeem up to  of such shares for a nominal amount upon the failure to occur of certain circumstances relating to possible research grant funding from the dod 
we were advised informally in february that  based upon such provision  anza may seek to redeem  shares held by us 
if such shares are redeemed by anza  we would own fewer shares of anza s preferred stock  reducing our preferred equity interest to approximately of anza s outstanding preferred equity 
we are evaluating whether such clause is applicable in the present circumstances 
there is no assurance that the equity will have monetary value at such time we are allowed to sell it or that we will receive any proceeds upon liquidation or sale of anza 
we were informed in february that anza had ceased operations 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or operate our business without infringing intellectual property rights of others 
our commercial success will depend  in part  on obtaining and maintaining patent protection on our products and successfully defending our products against third party challenges 
our technology will be protected from unauthorized use only to the extent that it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or effectively maintained as trade secrets 
as a result  our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we cannot be certain that our patents or patents that we license from others will be enforceable and afford protection against competitors 
our patents or patent applications  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
our patent rights may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technologies 
others may independently develop technologies similar to ours or independently duplicate our technologies 
for example  a united states patent issued to a third party covers methods to remove psoralen compounds from blood products 
we have reviewed the patent and believe there 
table of contents exist substantial questions concerning its validity 
we cannot be certain  however  that a court would hold the patent to be invalid or not infringed by our platelet or plasma systems  if and when those products are sold in the united states 
our key blood safety patents generally expire at various dates between and recent patent applications will  if granted  result in patents with later expiration dates 
in addition  we have a license from fenwal to united states and foreign patents relating to the intercept blood system  which expire from to due to the extensive time required for development  testing and regulatory review of our potential products  our patents may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization 
this would reduce or eliminate any advantage of the patents 
we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions 
we may need to license the right to use third party patents and intellectual property to continue development and commercialization of our products 
we may not be able to acquire such required licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we do not obtain such licenses  we may need to design around other parties patents  or we may not be able to proceed with the development  manufacture or sale of our products 
we may face litigation to defend against claims of infringement  assert claims of infringement  enforce our patents  protect our trade secrets or know how or determine the scope and validity of others proprietary rights 
patent litigation is costly 
in addition  we may require interference proceedings before the united states patent and trademark office to determine the priority of inventions relating to our patent applications 
litigation or interference proceedings could be expensive and time consuming  and we could be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we may rely  in certain circumstances  on trade secrets to protect our technology 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we protect our proprietary technology and processes  in part  by confidentiality agreements with employees and certain contractors 
these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach or our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
to the extent that our employees  consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others  disputes also may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know how and inventions 
as our international operations grow  we may be subject to adverse fluctuations in exchange rates between the united states dollar and foreign currencies 
consequently  we may suffer losses 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  among other factors differing political  economic  and regulatory climates  different tax structures  and foreign exchange volatility 
we do not currently enter into any hedging contracts to normalize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations 
as a result  our future results could be materially affected by changes in these or other factors 
product sales of our blood safety products are typically made in europe and generally are invoiced to customers in euros 
in addition  we purchase finished disposable kits for our platelet and plasma systems and incur operating expenses in euros and other foreign currencies 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility is a direct result of our product sales  cash collection and expenses to support our international operations 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations are recorded as a component of interest expense and other  net on our consolidated statements of operations 
significant fluctuations in the volatility of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar may materially affect our results of operations 
currently we do not have any near term plans to enter into a formal hedging program to mitigate the effects of foreign currency volatility 
the market price of our stock may be highly volatile 
the market prices for our securities and those of other emerging medical device and biotechnology companies have been  and may continue to be  volatile 
for example  during the period from january   to december   the sale price of our common stock as quoted on the nasdaq global market fluctuated 
table of contents within a range from a low of to a high of 
announcements may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
such announcements may include decisions regarding reimbursement and commercial adoption by customers  national blood services or governmental bodies  biological or medical discoveries  technological innovations discovered or new commercial services offered by us or our competitors  developments concerning proprietary rights  including patents and litigation matters  regulatory developments in both the united states and foreign countries  status of development partnerships  dilution from future issuances of common stock  including through the exercise of vested stock options  debt or other financings  with terms that may not be viewed favorably by shareholders  public concern as to the safety of new technologies  general market conditions  comments made by analysts  including changes in analysts estimates of our financial performance  and quarterly fluctuations in our revenue and financial results 
recently  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations due to the unprecedented turmoil and upheaval of the credit markets and the financial services industry  which have particularly affected the market prices for emerging biotechnology and medical device companies  and has adversely affected the market price of our common stock 
our stock price may not meet the minimum bid price for continued listing on the nasdaq global market 
our ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if we are delisted from the nasdaq global market or if we are unable to transfer our listing to another stock market 
on october   nasdaq temporarily suspended one of the listing requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq global market that requires a company s minimum bid price to be above per share 
this suspension was further extended by nasdaq on december  until april  our stock price is currently trading at below per share 
if our stock price does not return to a minimum bid price above per share before april   we will be subject to delisting by nasdaq for failure to meet the continued listing requirements 
delisting from nasdaq could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities  would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock 
delisting could also have other negative results  including the potential loss of confidence by employees  the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities 
we may fail to comply fully with elements of the sarbanes oxley act of our failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of this act could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accountants attesting to the effectiveness of our internal controls 
these requirements extend to the operations of our subsidiary in europe 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting  as 
table of contents such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude in future periods that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of if we cannot favorably assess  or our independent registered public accountants are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  investor confidence in the reliability of our financial reports may be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price

overview since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to the research  development  clinical testing and commercialization of blood safety systems and  from until late  immunotherapies for cancer and infectious disease 
with the exception of the financial reporting effects of a non recurring gain recognized in  we have been generally unprofitable since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our intercept platelet system  or the platelet system  and our intercept plasma system  or the plasma system  have received ce marks and are being marketed in europe  russia  the middle east and selected countries in other regions around the world 
we are pursuing regulatory approvals for the platelet and plasma systems in the united states and other countries 
the intercept red blood cell system  or the red blood cell system  is in early stage clinical development 
our near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors  including operating costs and working capital investments associated with commercializing the intercept blood system  costs associated with planning and conducting studies and clinical trials of our platelet and red blood cell systems  timing and magnitude of payments under grants from the united states government  and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending our intellectual property 
our long term capital requirements will also be dependent 
table of contents on competitive developments and regulatory factors 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and generate positive net cash flows from operations  meeting our long term capital requirements is in large part subject to access to public and private equity and debt capital markets  as well as to additional collaborative arrangements with partners or government grants  augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances and short term investments 
we believe that we will be able to make reductions in our operating expenses and inventory  which  together with our expected revenues  will result in sufficient capital to fund operations into if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
we expect to prioritize continued commercialization of the platelet and plasma systems in europe  russia  the middle east and in selected countries in other regions around the world over pursuit of regulatory approval of the platelet system in the united states and development and commercialization of the red blood cell system 
we may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth on terms that may include restrictive covenants  including covenants that restrict the operation of our business  liens on assets  high effective interest rates and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
recently  the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
these events have generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain 
in addition  our independent registered public accountants have indicated that our recurring operating losses raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
this opinion may make it more difficult for us to raise funds when needed 
as a result of these and other factors  we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will be able to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms 
if we are unable to raise additional capital due to the recent disruptions to the credit and financial markets in the united states and worldwide or other factors  we will need to curtail planned development and commercialization activities 
since february  we have begun to recognize growing  but still modest  product revenues from the sale of our platelet and plasma systems in europe  russia  the middle east  and certain other countries around the world 
prior to initiating such commercial operations  our primary sources of revenue were milestone payments  development contracts and collaborative agreements and grants from united states government agencies  including the united states armed forces and the national institutes of health  or national institutes of health  or nih 
we must conduct significant research  development  preclinical and clinical evaluation  commercialization and regulatory compliance activities for our products that  together with anticipated general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in substantial losses at least until after our platelet and plasma systems gain widespread commercial acceptance in europe  russia  the middle east  and selected countries in other regions around the world 
our ability to achieve a profitable level of operations in the future will depend on our ability to successfully commercialize and achieve market acceptance of our blood safety products 
we may never achieve a profitable level of operations 
under the agreements with bioone  we have received in the past milestone payments and may receive additional contingent milestone payments and royalties on future product sales 
we pay royalties to fenwal on product sales  at rates of of net sales for the platelet system  for the plasma system  for the red blood cell system  and on sales of uva illuminators 
this royalty structure replaced the profit sharing arrangement of previous agreements between us and baxter under which we had received a defined share of gross profit from product sales 
baxter also agreed to manufacture systems for the platelet and plasma systems on a cost plus basis through december   and components through december  the terms of our supply agreement with baxter also provided that baxter would supply only 
table of contents very limited types of components for the prototype of the red blood cell system 
in march  we were informed that fenwal had assumed baxter s manufacturing obligations to us and that our royalty payments would be made directly to fenwal 
in december  we amended and extended our supply agreement with fenwal to include fenwal s manufacture finished disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems through december  under the amended manufacturing agreement  we pay fenwal a set price per kit  which is established annually plus a fixed surcharge per kit 
in addition  volume driven manufacturing overhead will be paid or refunded if actual manufacturing volumes are lower or higher than the annually estimated production volumes 
we are responsible for the commercialization and ongoing development of the platelet and plasma systems  except in parts of asia  where bioone is responsible for such commercialization 
subject to the availability of adequate funding from partners  government grants  and or capital markets  we also anticipate continuing our expenditures in support of preclinical and clinical trials and device development of our red blood cell system over the next several years if we can attract financing from partners  government grants  and or the capital markets 
in november  we spun off our immunotherapy business to anza 
in exchange for contributed tangible and intangible assets  we received preferred stock representing an equity interest of approximately of anza s preferred equity 
the terms of sale provided anza a right to redeem up to  of such shares for a nominal amount upon the failure to occur of certain circumstances relating to possible research grant funding from the dod 
we were advised informally in february that  based upon such provision  anza may seek to redeem  shares held by us 
if such shares are redeemed by anza  we would own fewer shares of anza s preferred stock  reducing our preferred equity interest to approximately of anza s outstanding preferred equity 
we are evaluating whether such clause is applicable in the present circumstances 
there is no assurance that the equity will have monetary value at such time we are allowed to sell it or that we will receive any proceeds upon liquidation or sale of anza 
we were informed in february that anza had ceased operations 
we accounted for the immunotherapy business as a discontinued operation and restated our consolidated financial statements for prior periods to reflect the discontinued operation 
because of the risks and uncertainties underlying anza s business  we have not assigned a value to our ownership interest in anza on our consolidated balance sheets 
we have provided certain transition services to anza under terms of a transition services agreement under which anza reimburses us for our direct costs associated with providing such services 
the transition services we are providing to anza are generally ancillary in nature and do not involve anza s core business or any scientific research or development 
we also sublease  square feet to anza under a month to month sublease that on its terms will expire no later than march  through december   in addition to the product revenues from sales of our platelet and plasma systems  we have recognized revenue from grants and cooperative agreements with the armed forces 
as a result of selling our immunotherapy business to anza  previously reported revenue associated with grants and cooperative agreements with the nih are reported as a component of loss from discontinued operations for all periods presented 
critical accounting policies and management estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  accrued liabilities  non cash stock compensation assumptions  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue revenue is recognized when i persuasive evidence of an agreement with the funding party exists  ii products and or services have been delivered or rendered  respectively  iii pricing is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is probable 
revenue related to product sales is generally recognized when we fulfill our obligations for each element of an agreement 
for all sales of our intercept blood system products  we use a binding purchase order and signed sales contract as evidence of a written agreement 
we sell intercept blood system for platelets and plasma directly to blood banks  hospitals  universities  government agencies  as well as to distributors in certain regions 
generally  our contracts with customers do not provide for open return rights  except within a reasonable time after receipt of goods in the case of defective product 
deliverables and the units of accounting vary according to the provisions of each customer agreement 
for revenue arrangements with multiple elements we evaluate whether the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer  whether the fair value of the undelivered elements is reliably determinable  and whether the delivery of the remaining elements is probable and within our control 
when all of these conditions are met  we recognize the revenue on the delivered elements 
if these conditions are not met  we defer revenue until such time as all of the conditions have been met or all of the elements have been delivered 
consideration received is allocated to elements that are identified as discrete units of accounting based on the relative fair market value method 
freight costs charged to customers are recorded as a component of revenue and value added taxes  or vat  that we invoice to our customers and remit to governments are recorded on a net basis  which excludes such vat from product revenue 
revenue related to the cost reimbursement provisions under development contracts is recognized as the costs on the projects are incurred 
we receive certain united states government grants and contracts that support research in defined research projects 
these grants generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs incurred as defined in the various grants 
revenue associated with these grants is recognized as costs under each grant are incurred 
revenue related to substantive at risk milestones specified under development contracts is recognized as the milestones are achieved 
to date  we have not received license fees or milestone payments that are refundable 
to the extent that license fees or milestone payments that we have received are subject to future performance criteria  we recognize revenue ratably over the estimated term of the license or the development period 
we have received up front payments from collaboration agreements which are deferred and recognized over the period during which we estimate we are likely to have involvement 
we have also received equity in two privately held companies in addition to cash as consideration for licensed rights or technologies 
we evaluate several criteria to determine the fair value of the equity received and to conclude whether the facts and circumstances support a fair value for revenue recognition and the investment balance 
these criteria include  but are not limited to  third party investor interest and participation in recent equity offerings at current pricing  business outlook of the privately held company  and available financial information of the privately held company 
the financial information we receive is generally only available on an infrequent basis 
although management uses the best available information at the time  there can be no absolute assurance that facts and circumstances will not change in the future 
should these facts and circumstances change  they may negatively impact our consolidated financial statements 
inventory we own work in process inventory for certain components of intercept disposable kits  finished intercept disposable kits  illuminators  and certain replacement parts for our illuminators 
our supply chain for certain of these components  held as work in process on our balance sheet  can take over one year to complete production before being utilized in finished disposable kits 
inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market value  determined on a first in  first out basis 
our platelet and plasma system kits generally have a two year shelf life from the date of manufacture 
illuminators and replacement parts do not have regulated expiration dates 
we use significant judgment to analyze and determine if the composition of our inventory is 
table of contents obsolete  slow moving  or unsalable 
our limited history selling the intercept blood system limits the amount of historical data we have to perform this analysis 
generally  we write down specifically identified obsolete  slow moving  or known unsalable inventory using a number of factors including product expiration dates  open and unfulfilled orders  forecasts  and inventory turnover 
accrued expenses we record accrued liabilities for expenses related to certain contract research activities and development services  including those related to clinical trials  preclinical safety studies and external laboratory studies  as well as transition services and development activities being performed by third parties 
some of those accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services 
specifically  accruals for clinical trials require us to make estimates surrounding costs associated with patients at various stages of the clinical trial  pass through costs to clinical sites  contract research organization costs including fees  database development  and reporting costs  among others 
stock based compensation we issue stock based awards to our employees  members of our board of directors  members of our scientific advisory board and certain contractors as strategic  long term incentives 
we recorded stock based compensation expense for employee awards under statement of financial accounting standards  or fas  no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation fas r 
we determine the grant date fair value of a stock award using the black scholes option pricing model 
we continue to apply the provisions of emerging issues task force  or eitf   accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunctions with selling  goods or services  for our non employee stock based awards 
under eitf  the measurement date at which the fair value of the stock based award is measured is equal to the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the grantee to earn the equity instrument is reached or ii the date at which the grantee s performance is complete 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for the fair value of the vested portion of the non employee awards in our consolidated statements of operations 
the black scholes option pricing model calculates the grant date fair value using certain variables 
these variables are impacted by our stock price  award exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate and our expected dividends and many of these variables require us to use significant judgment 
expected term 
we estimate the expected term of options granted using a variety of factors 
where possible  we estimate the expected term of options granted by analyzing employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior 
to make this estimation  we analyze the population of options granted by discreet homogeneous groups 
for those homogeneous groups where we are unable to obtain sufficient information to estimate the expected term in this manner  we estimate the expected term of the options granted by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option  as illustrated in the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
and  share based payment  or sab and sab the expected term of employee stock purchase plan shares is the term of each offering period 
estimated forfeiture rate 
we estimate the forfeiture rate of options at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we estimate the historic pre vesting forfeiture rates by groups that possess a degree of homogeneity regarding average time to vest and expected term 
all stock based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
estimated volatility 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using historical volatility of our common stock 
we have used significant judgment in making these estimates and we will continue to monitor the availability of actively traded options on our common stock 
if we determine that sufficient actively traded options on our common stock exist  we may consider a combination of historical and implied volatility  or solely implied volatility 

table of contents risk free interest rate 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option valuation model on united states treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
expected dividend 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model 
if factors change and we utilize different assumptions in determining the grant date fair value of stock compensation expense in the future  or if we utilize a different option pricing model in the future  then those results may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating results 
there is significant risk that the black scholes option pricing model and the judgment we have used in ascertaining the variables will yield results that differ materially from the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  termination or forfeitures of the awards in the future 
historical results were utilized in deriving our variables  which may not be indicative of the future 
income taxes since our inception we have accumulated significant net operating losses and research and development credits that may be used in future periods to offset future taxable income 
we currently estimate that we may not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets 
in addition  we may not generate future taxable income prior to the expiration of our net operating loss carry forwards and research and development credits 
timing and significance of any estimated future taxable income is highly subjective and is beyond the control of management due to uncertainties in market conditions  economic environments in which we operate  and timing of regulatory approval of our products 
financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin  became effective for us on january  fin requires derecognition of tax positions that do not have a greater than likelihood of being recognized upon review by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
use of a valuation allowance as described in financial accounting standard  accounting for income taxes  or fas  is not an appropriate substitute for the derecognition of a tax position 
we did not have any recorded liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits at december  or we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax expense 
to date  we have not recognized any interest and penalties in our statements of operations  nor have we accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties 
the adoption of fin has not have a significant impact on us 
we continue to carry a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets 
although we believe it more likely than not that a taxing authority would agree with our current tax positions  there can be no assurance that the tax positions we have taken will be substantiated by a taxing authority if reviewed 
results of operations years ended december    and revenue years ended december  change to change to in thousands  except percentage product revenue government grant and cooperative agreements milestone and development funding milestone and development revenue from related party total revenue product revenue increased million to million during the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in the prior year 
the increase was largely driven by an 
table of contents increase in the number of disposable platelet and plasma system kits sold to customers in europe  russia  and the middle east 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of product revenue from sales of the intercept blood system for platelets and plasma  compared to million during the same period in the increase was largely driven by an increase in sales of platelet disposable kits and uva illuminators 
we anticipate product revenue for both the platelet and plasma systems will continue to increase in future periods as the intercept blood system gains market acceptance in geographies where commercialization efforts are underway 
these annual results may not be indicative of intercept blood system revenue in the future 
we recognized million in revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the activities subject to reimbursement under current awards with the united states dod  or dod 
of the total awarded amount during the year ended december   the majority of the grant revenue came from reimbursement under a dod award for development activities related to our red blood cell system 
for the year ended december   the majority of the grant revenue was also from an award from the dod for our red blood cell system 
we recognized million in revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in the decrease was due primarily to the reduced awards from the armed forces for research activities for our intercept blood system programs 
we no longer are deemed to be a small business for purposes of being eligible for certain grants administered by the nih and regulated by the small business administration 
as a result  we are not eligible to apply for any new grants for which only small businesses are eligible 
we recognized no milestone and development funding during the years ended december   and  down from million in the comparable period in  when we last received cost reimbursement funding from baxter under previous and now terminated agreements 
in  we also recognized million in milestone revenue from bioone  a related party 
this revenue was the result of our achieving certain milestones under our platelet and plasma agreements with bioone 
we do not anticipate receiving significant milestones or royalties from bioone in the near future 
total revenue increased million to million during the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in the increase of million was largely due to an increase in the number of disposable platelet and plasma system kits sold to customers in europe  russia  and the middle east  offset partially by a decrease in revenue recognized from government grants and cooperative agreements 
total revenue decreased million to million during the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in the decrease from to was largely due to the million in milestone payments from bioone and the million in development funding from baxter recognized in compared to no milestone payment or development funding recognized in  a decrease of million from government grant and cooperative agreement revenue  offset by million in higher product revenue 
cost of product revenue our cost of product revenue consists of the cost of the intercept blood system inventory sold  royalties payable to fenwal for product sales  provisions for obsolete  slow moving and unsaleable product  and certain order fulfillment costs 
inventory is accounted for on a first in  first out basis 
years ended december  change to change to in thousands  except percentage cost of product revenue cost of product revenue increased million to million during the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in the increase in the cost of product revenue was 
table of contents primarily due to the larger number of disposable platelet and plasma system kits sold during the year ended december   compared to the number sold during the year ended december  in addition  royalties owed to fenwal increased during the year ended december   compared to the same period in  also due to increased sales of both the platelet and plasma systems during the year ended december  finally  cost of product revenue increased in compared to due to a non cash reserve of million for potentially unusable work in progress inventory 
we are currently in the process of evaluating whether or not any of this potentially unusable work in progress inventory can be salvaged 
if we are able to salvage some  or the entire inventory  we may record a reversal of the reserve as the inventory is sold to customers  which would have a positive effect on our gross margins in the period of reversal 
similarly  cost of product revenue increased million to million during the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in due to the higher number of disposable platelet system kits and illuminators sold during the year ended december  and the corresponding royalties owed to fenwal for those sales compared to the same period in we anticipate that our cost of product revenue will continue to increase in the future as we continue to increase product sales volume 
our realized gross margins on product sales were in  up from in  and down from in the changes in our gross margins are affected by various factors  including manufacturing and supply chain costs  the mix of product sold  and the mix of customers to which product is sold 
generally  we offer our distributors tiered volume discounts of varying magnitudes  depending on their purchase commitments  which  depending on sales volumes to those distributors receiving tiered volume discounts  may impact our gross margins 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses include salaries and related expenses for our scientific personnel  non cash stock based compensation  payments to consultants  costs to prepare and conduct preclinical and clinical trials  third party costs for development activities  certain regulatory costs  and costs associated with our infrastructure  and laboratory chemicals and supplies 
years ended december  change to change to in thousands  except percentage research and development research and development expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in the decrease in our research and development expenses during the year ended december   compared to was the result of reduced development activities regarding our plasma system and lower clinical trial costs associated with our red blood cell system 
research and development expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in the decrease in our research and development expenses during the year ended december   compared to was a result of a decline in development activities associated with our plasma system subsequent to receiving a ce mark in november in addition during the second half of we initiated a phase i clinical trial related to our red blood cell system 
costs associated with this phase i clinical trial were higher in than in  the period in which the clinical trial concluded 
of our total research and development costs incurred  non cash stock based compensation represented million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we anticipate our research and development spending will continue and  subject to funding from government grants or potential partners  at times may increase as a result of ongoing product development and 
table of contents later stage  more expensive clinical trials  and as potential new products move from development to preclinical and clinical trials 
due to the inherent uncertainties and risks associated with developing biomedical products  including  but not limited to  intense and changing government regulation  uncertainty of future pre clinical and clinical study results and uncertainty associated with manufacturing  it is not possible to reasonably estimate the costs to complete these research and development projects 
we face numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the successful completion of our research and development projects  including the risks described in risk factors in part i  item a above 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses include salaries and related expenses for administrative personnel  non cash stock based compensation  expenses for our commercialization efforts in europe and elsewhere  expenses for accounting  tax  and internal control  legal and facility related expenses  and insurance premiums 
years ended december  change to change to in thousands  except percentage selling  general and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in overall  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   was primarily due to continued expansion of our commercial operations based in europe  including increases in personnel costs  and to a lesser extent  increased marketing activities 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily due to the costs of maintaining and expanding our commercial operations in europe  representing million of the increase  as well as increased legal and outside professional fees  marketing  and travel expenses 
of the total selling  general  and administrative expenses incurred  non cash stock based compensation represented million  million  and million for the years ended december    and respectively 
we anticipate that we will be focused on maintaining our selling  general  and administrative spending at no more than current levels over the next year  as part of a larger effort to lower operating expenses and conserve cash 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net consists of interest earned from our short term investment portfolio  foreign exchange gain loss  and other non operating gains and losses 
years ended december  change to change to in thousands  except percentage interest income expense and other  net interest income and other  net  was million for the year ended december   compared to million in income during the comparable period in the decrease in income was primarily due to lower interest income and foreign currency exchange rate differences between the united states dollar and the euro  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  in addition  during 
table of contents the year ended december   we recorded other than temporary impairments totaling million to our investment portfolio as a result of market deterioration due to the tightening global credit crisis 
interest income and other  net  was million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income and other  net  was primarily due to the recognition of a non operating gain of million during the year ended december   resulting from cash consideration received from baxter as a component of the february commercialization transition agreement 
in addition  during  we recognized losses on certain marketable securities that we felt were experiencing an other than temporary decline in fair value 
the recognized losses adjusted our carrying value to the fair value of the securities at december   which became our basis for recording future gains or losses upon sale or maturity 
partially offsetting this decrease from was an increase in interest income of million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income was primarily due to consistently higher cash and investment balances maintained during the year ended december   compared to the comparable period in  primarily as a result of our public offerings in march and december we expect to earn interest income at market rates in proportion to the marketable securities balances we maintain 
however  due to the recent turmoil of the credit markets and in the financial services industry  the interest paid on certain of our investments may decrease and the value of certain securities we hold may decline  which could negatively affect our financial condition  cash flow and reported earnings 
in march and december  we completed public offerings of our common stock  which resulted in increased cash balances 
we invested these proceeds in marketable securities pursuant to our investment policy  and generally hold such investments until such time as we liquidate them to meet an operating cash need 
loss from discontinued operations the results of our former immunotherapy segment for the years ended december    and are summarized in the following table years ended december  change to change to in thousands  except percentage revenue operating expenses loss from discontinued operations loss from sale of discontinued operations net loss from discontinued operations liquidity and capital resources our sources of capital to date have primarily consisted of public offerings and private placements of equity securities  the loan from baxter capital  payments received under our agreements with baxter  bioone and others  united states government grants and cooperative agreements  and  to a lesser degree and more recently  contribution from product sales net of expenses and interest income 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in the decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities  notably decreases in our accrued expenses and increases in our 
table of contents inventory balances  offset by decreases in our accounts receivable balances 
cash used in operating activities during the year ended december   was million compared to million during the comparable period in the increase in cash used was primarily due to decreases in our revenues and related cash collections in compared to  as well as changes in our operating assets and liabilities  notably increases in our inventory balances 
net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended december   was million compared to million during the comparable period in the increase was primarily due to fewer purchases of short term investments in  offset by the sales and maturities of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december   was million  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million and million for the same periods in and  respectively 
the cash provided from financing activities in and was primarily due to cash received from the exercise of stock options  while cash from financing activities in was primarily the result of two issuances of common stock yielding million in net proceeds  offset by the repayment of a loan from baxter capital of million plus accrued interest 
working capital decreased to million at december   from million and million at december   and  respectively primarily due to lower cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and partially offset by increased accounts receivable and inventory balances  net of accounts payable balances 
our near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors  including operating costs and capital investments associated with commercializing the intercept blood system  costs associated with planning and conducting clinical trials of our red blood cell system  timing and magnitude of payments under grants from the united states government  and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending our intellectual property 
our long term capital requirements will also be dependent on competitive developments and regulatory factors 
until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and generate positive cash flows from operations  meeting our long term capital requirements is in large part subject to access to public and private equity and debt capital markets  as well as to additional collaborative arrangements with partners or government grants  augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances and short term investments 
although our independent registered public accountants have indicated a substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern  we believe that we will be able to make reductions in our operating expenses and inventory  which  together with our expected revenues  will result in sufficient capital to fund operations into if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
we expect to prioritize continued commercialization of the platelet and plasma systems in europe  russia  the middle east and in selected countries in other regions around the world  over the pursuit of regulatory approval of the platelet system in the united states and development and commercialization of the red blood cell system 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the commercialization of the platelet and plasma systems  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approval and subsequent launch of our platelet and plasma systems in the united states  and the development of the red blood cell system and other development activities  including risks and uncertainties that could impact the rate of progress of our development activities  we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures that may ultimately be associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials and other research and development activities 
we may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth on terms that may include restrictive covenants  including covenants that restrict the operation of our business  liens on assets  high effective interest rates and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or product  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
recently  the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
as a result of these and other factors  we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will be able to obtain additional capital 
table of contents on terms reasonable to us or our stockholders 
if we are unable to raise additional capital due to the recent disruptions to the credit and financial markets in the united states and worldwide or other factors  we will need to curtail planned development activities and commercialization activities 
historically  we had received significant awards in funding under cooperative agreements with the dod for the intercept blood system 
we also received funding under grants from the national institutes of health  largely in support of the immunotherapy business that we spun off in late further funding awarded under federal grants and cooperative agreements for the intercept blood systems may decline when compared to historic levels 
any such funding is subject to the authorization of funds and approval of our research plans by various organizations within the federal government  including the united states congress 
the general economic environment  coupled with tight federal budgets  has led to a general decline in the amount of government funding 
additionally  we no longer are deemed to be a small business for purposes of being eligible for certain grants administered by the national institutes of health and regulated by small business administration 
historically  a significant portion of our grant revenue came from awards surrounding our former immunotherapy business 
if we are unable to obtain federal grant and cooperative agreement funding for future blood safety activities at levels similar to past funding  we may need to reduce our operating expenses  which would delay progress in some of our development programs 
in addition  we are required separately to administer and account for our work under government contracts and grants on an on going basis as a condition to accepting government funding which places administrative  accounting and reporting burdens on us beyond those we have assumed as a public company 
if we fail to comply with applicable governmental administrative  accounting and reporting regulations with respect to these grants and cooperative agreements  funds currently available to us may be reduced or lost 
these conditions may also result in increased selling  general  and administrative spending beyond what we have experienced 
in late october  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s to offer and sell up to million of common stock  preferred stock  warrants  and or debt securities 
this shelf registration statement was declared effective by the sec in december  however  our ability to sell shares under this shelf registration statement may be limited due to applicable rules of the securities act 
commitments and off balance sheet arrangements commitments our commitments are as follows in thousands payments due by period from december  total less than year years years after years contractual obligations minimum purchase requirements operating leases other commitment total contractual cash obligations our minimum purchase commitments include certain components of our intercept blood safety system that we purchase from third party manufacturers and supplied to fenwal for use in manufacturing finished disposable kits 
operating leases we lease our office facilities and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases with initial terms in excess of one year that require us to pay operating costs  property taxes  insurance and maintenance 
these facility leases generally contain renewal options and provisions adjusting the lease payments if those renewal 
table of contents options are exercised 
our facility leases qualify as operating leases under fas no 
 accounting for leases and as such  are not included on our balance sheet 
royalties we are obligated to pay royalties on certain intercept product sales based on a percentage of net sales generated 
the royalty rates vary by product  with rates of of net sales for the platelet system  for the plasma system  for the red blood cell system  and for uva illuminators 
as future product sales cannot be estimated  this royalty obligation is not included in the table above 
credit facility in june  we entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank  na  or the facility  which allows us to borrow up to million to be used for working capital and general operating needs 
the initial term of the facility is one year  if not extended 
in december we amended the terms of the facility 
interest on borrowings under the facility accrues on a fixed rate of libor plus three and one half percent for borrowings in excess of million for one  two  three  or six months 
the facility is secured by all of our assets  excluding intellectual property 
the facility also contains certain customary financial and non financial conditions  as well as certain specific financial covenants  including covenants that require us to maintain certain minimum cash balances and incur maximum net operating losses in any given quarter during which the facility is in place 
these covenants presently preclude us from borrowing under the facility until such time as we have cured conditions that gave rise to a default under these financial covenants 
at december   no amount was outstanding under the facility 
financial instruments we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio to assist us in funding our operations 
unrealized gains at december   and  totaled million and million respectively 
we invest our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of financial instruments  consisting primarily of high credit  high liquidity united state government agency securities  asset backed securities  corporate debt securities  money market funds and interest bearing accounts with financial institutions 
we maintain portfolio liquidity by ensuring that the securities have active secondary or resale markets 
certain of the investments in our portfolio are subject to general market risk and more specifically  the united states mortgage industry and financial institutions 
as a result  during the years ended december    and  we recognized other than temporary impairments for certain investments in our portfolio totaling million  million  and million  respectively 
the current global economic crisis has had  and may continue to have  a negative impact on the market values of the investments in our investment portfolio 
there can be no assurance that the markets for these securities will not deteriorate further or that the institutions that these investments are with will be able to meet their debt obligations at the time we may need to liquidate such investments or until such time as the investments mature 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk of our cash  cash equivalent  and short term investments balance of million at december   approximately had original maturity dates of less than days  and none had original maturities of days to one year 
we do not believe our exposure to interest rate risk to be material given the short term nature of our investment portfolio and the consistent yields we have experienced and anticipate experiencing across our portfolio  regardless of maturity date 

table of contents our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
by policy  we place our investments with high quality debt security issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and limit duration by restricting the term for single securities and for the portfolio as a whole 
our investments are held and managed by a third party capital management adviser that in turn  utilizes a combination of active market quotes and where necessary  proprietary pricing models as well as a subscribed pricing service  in order to estimate fair value 
we invest our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of financial instruments  consisting primarily of high credit  high liquidity united states government agency securities  commercial paper  corporate debt securities  money market funds and interest bearing accounts with financial institutions 
we maintain portfolio liquidity by ensuring that the securities have active secondary or resale markets 
certain of the investments in our portfolio are subject to general market risk and more specifically  the united states mortgage industry 
while we believe that we will be able to recognize the fair value of these instruments when they mature or we sell them  there can be no assurance that the markets for these securities will not deteriorate further or that the institutions that these investments are with will be able to meet their debt obligations 
we account for our short term investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities
