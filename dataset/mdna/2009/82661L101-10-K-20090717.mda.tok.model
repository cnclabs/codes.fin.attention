overview the company operates in one business segment as an independent provider of ems  which includes printed circuit board assemblies and completely assembled box build electronic products 
in connection with the production of assembled products  the company also provides services to its customers  including automatic and manual assembly and testing of products  material sourcing and procurement  design  
table of contents manufacturing and test engineering support  warehousing and shipment services  and assistance in obtaining product approval from governmental and other regulatory bodies 
the company provides these manufacturing services through an international network of facilities located in the united states  mexico  china and taiwan 
the company relies on numerous third party suppliers for components used in the company s production process 
certain of these components are available only from single sources or a limited number of suppliers 
in addition  a customer s specifications may require the company to obtain components from a single source or a small number of suppliers 
the loss of any such suppliers could have a material impact on the company s results of operations  and the company may be required to operate at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater direct buying power from suppliers 
the company does not enter into purchase agreements with major or single source suppliers 
the company believes that ad hoc negotiations with its suppliers provides flexibility  given that the company s orders are based on the needs of its customers  which constantly change 
the sarbanes oxley act  as well as rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission and listing requirements subsequently adopted by nasdaq in response to sarbanes oxley  have required changes in corporate governance practices  internal control policies and audit committee practices of public companies 
these rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members for our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee 
in addition  if the company receives a qualified opinion on the adequacy of its internal control over financial reporting  shareholders and the company s lenders could lose confidence in the reliability of the company s financial statements 
this could have a material adverse impact on the value of the company s stock and the company s liquidity 
sales can be a misleading indicator of the company s financial performance 
sales levels can vary considerably among customers and products depending on the type of services consignment and turnkey rendered by the company and the demand by customers 
consignment orders require the company to perform manufacturing services on components and other materials supplied by a customer  and the company charges only for its labor  overhead and manufacturing costs  plus a profit 
in the case of turnkey orders  the company provides  in addition to manufacturing services  the components and other materials used in assembly 
turnkey contracts  in general  have a higher dollar volume of sales for each given assembly  owing to inclusion of the cost of components and other materials in net sales and cost of goods sold 
variations in the number of turnkey orders compared to consignment orders can lead to significant fluctuations in the company s revenue levels 
however  the company does not believe that such variations are a meaningful indicator of the company s gross margins 
consignment orders accounted for less than of the company s revenues for the year ended april  in the past  the timing and rescheduling of orders have caused the company to experience significant quarterly fluctuations in its revenues and earnings  and the company expects such fluctuations to continue 
the uncertainty associated with the worldwide economy in general and the united states economy specifically make forecasting difficult 
all of the company s customer s markets remain volatile 
the company believes it will continue to see lower revenues and more volatility until at least the fall of critical accounting policies management estimates and uncertainties the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements include depreciation and amortization periods  the allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for inventory and valuation of long lived assets 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenues from sales of the company s electronic manufacturing services business are recognized when the product is shipped to the customer 
in general  it is the company s policy to 
table of contents recognize revenue and related costs when the order has been shipped from our facilities  which is also the same point that title passes under the terms of the purchase order except for consignment inventory 
consignment inventory is shipped from the company to an independent warehouse for storage or shipped directly to the customer and stored in a segregated part of the customer s own facility 
upon the customer s request for inventory  the consignment inventory is shipped to the customer if the inventory was stored offsite or transferred from the segregated part of the customer s facility for consumption  or use  by the customer 
the company recognizes revenue upon such transfer 
the company does not earn a fee for storing the consignment inventory 
the company generally provides a day warranty for workmanship only and does not have any installation  acceptance or sales incentives  although the company has negotiated longer warranty terms in certain instances 
the company assembles and tests assemblies based on customers specifications 
historically  the amount of returns for workmanship issues has been de minimis under the company s standard or extended warranties 
any returns for workmanship issues received after each period end are accrued in the respective financial statements 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
the company establishes inventory reserves for valuation  shrinkage  and excess and obsolete inventory 
the company records provisions for inventory shrinkage based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss 
actual results differing from these estimates could significantly affect the company s inventories and cost of products sold 
the company records provisions for excess and obsolete inventories for the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
actual product demand or market conditions could be different than that projected by management 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted net cash flow the asset is expected to generate 
if such asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value

r for any business combinations occurring subsequent to april  in january  the company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test from the last day of the fiscal year to the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter 
the impairment test procedures were carried out during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and up to the time of the filing of the company s form k for fiscal year  which allowed the company additional time to complete the required analysis 
the company believes that the resulting change in accounting principle related to the annual testing date did not delay  accelerate or avoid an impairment charge 
the company determined that the change in accounting principle related to the annual testing date was preferable under the circumstances and did not result in adjustments to the company s financial statements when applied retrospectively 
during the fiscal year  the company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing and the carrying value of the company s reporting unit exceeded the fair value indicating a goodwill impairment 
the company completed the second step of the goodwill impairment test used to measure the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
as a result of this 
table of contents impairment analysis  the company recorded an impairment charge for the full amount of goodwill million during the fiscal year ended april  the impairment was due to continuing customer pricing pressures and uncertain economic conditions as well as the company s declining stock price during fiscal new accounting standards in september  the fasb issued sfas no

results of operations fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  net sales decreased to  in fiscal year from  in the prior year 
the company s sales decreased in fiscal year in the industrial electronics  fitness  telecommunications  life sciences  appliance  gaming and semiconductor marketplaces as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in revenue for the fiscal year end is a result of our customers decreased demand for product based on 
table of contents their forecast  which we believe is attributable to the global economic slowdown and the recent financial crisis 
the company anticipates sales will remain soft in the first quarter of fiscal year and anticipates sales to slowly increase in late calendar the company s sales in a particular industry are driven by the fluctuating forecasts and end market demand of the customers within that industry 
sales to customers are subject to variations from period to period depending on customer order terminations  the life cycle of customer products and product transition 
sales to the company s five largest customers accounted for of net sales for fiscal years and gross profit decreased to  or of net sales in fiscal year compared to  or of net sales in the prior year 
the decrease in the company s gross profit in total dollars is due to decreased revenue levels and decreased plant capacity utilization 
the company has continued to lower its cost structure during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and will continue cost cutting initiatives based on customer s demand for product 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  the company reduced its worldwide headcount  through attrition and lay offs 
further the company implemented salary reductions for all non union us employees beginning february there can be no assurance that sales levels or gross margins will not continue to decrease in future periods 
selling and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal year to  or of net sales compared to  or of net sales in fiscal year the decrease in total dollars is primarily due to a decrease in sales commissions  insurance expense  amortization expense  bonus expense  legal fees and other professional fees 
this decrease in total dollars was partially offset by an increase in sales and it salaries in fiscal year compared to the prior year 
the increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales in fiscal year is due to the decrease in net sales 
during fiscal year  the company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing and the carrying value of the company s reporting unit exceeded the fair value indicating a goodwill impairment 
the company completed the second step of the goodwill impairment test used to measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
as a result of this impairment analysis  the company recorded an impairment charge for the full amount of goodwill million during the year ended april  the impairment was due to continuing customer pricing pressures and uncertain economic conditions as well as the company s declining stock price during fiscal interest expense decreased to  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year the interest expense decreased due to decreased borrowings under its revolving credit facility  term loan and capital leases and lower interest rates 
interest expense for fiscal year may increase if interest rates or borrowings increase during fiscal year in fiscal year  the income tax expense from operations was  compared to  in income tax expense in fiscal year the effective tax rate for the year ended april  was 
the lower effective tax rate was a result of the tax holiday for the china operation 
the company recorded income tax expense in fiscal despite a pre tax loss due primarily to the fact that the goodwill impairment charge of million related to non deductible goodwill which is treated as a permanent difference between book and tax income loss 
the company reported net income of  in fiscal year basic and diluted earnings per share was for fiscal year compared to basic and diluted loss per share of for the year ended april  excluding the goodwill impairment charge  net income was  for fiscal year  which resulted in diluted earnings per share of for fiscal year compared to for the fiscal year ended april  we believe the non gaap measure is a meaningful disclosure of the operating performance of the company as it is an alternative measure utilized by investors  management and the board of directors

liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
cash flow provided by operating activities was  for the year ended april   compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal year was primarily the result of a  decrease in accounts receivable  a reduction in inventory levels  the result of the non cash effect of depreciation and amortization and net income 
net cash provided by operations in fiscal year was partially offset by a  reduction in accounts payable 
the decrease in accounts payable and accounts receivable is due to payments in the ordinary course of business  coupled with the company s reduced sales in fiscal year the decrease in inventory was the result of our customers decreased demand for product based on their forecasts  which we believe is attributable to the global economic slowdown and financial crisis 
the company s working capital requirements have decreased primarily as a result of the decrease in sales volume during fiscal cash flow provided by operating activities was  for the year ended april  cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of net income excluding the goodwill impairment charge net of the non cash effect of depreciation and amortization and an increase in trade accounts payable
