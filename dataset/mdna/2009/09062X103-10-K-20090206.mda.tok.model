the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k  beginning on page f executive summary biogen idec inc was formed in upon the acquisition of biogen  inc by idec pharmaceuticals corporation in a merger transaction  or the merger 
we are a global biotechnology company that creates new standards of care in therapeutic areas of high unmet medical needs 
we have two licensed biological bulk manufacturing facilities  including our large scale manufacturing plant in research triangle park  nc  which is one of the world s largest cell culture facilities 
an additional large scale manufacturing plant is under construction in hiller d  denmark 
we conduct research in san diego  ca and cambridge  ma 
in  we entered into an agreement with a real estate developer for the construction and leasing of a corporate headquarters in weston  ma 
we anticipate occupancy in we have additional offices in canada  brazil  argentina  australia  new zealand  japan  china  india and throughout europe  including our international headquarters in zug  switzerland and operate a global distribution network  which covers over countries 
we currently employ approximately  people worldwide 
results for the year ended december  included total revenue of  million  net income of million and diluted net income per share of 
these results reflect continued growth in unit sales of tysabri  an increase in revenues from an unconsolidated joint business arrangement due to increased sales of rituxan  as well as the impact of price increases in the united states and the favorable impact of exchange rates in rest of world on our avonex product 
the effect of the increase in revenue was partially offset by an increase in research and development expense due to increased level of phase clinical trials and other projects  and an increase in selling  general and administrative expense related to a higher level of personnel to sustain avonex sales and drive tysabri growth 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed a reorganization of our domestic and 
table of contents international operations  which included the movement of certain personnel and operational functions between biogen idec subsidiaries  as well as a restructuring of our supply chain 
marketed products we currently have four marketed products avonex interferon beta a  rituxan rituximab  tysabri natalizumab  fumaderm dimethylfumarate and monoethylfumarate salts through december we recorded product revenue from sales of zevalin ibritumomab tiuxetan in the us in december  we sold the us marketing  sales  manufacturing and development rights of zevalin to cell therapeutics  inc  or cti  for an upfront purchase price of million 
in december  pursuant to an amendment of the agreement  we received an additional million milestone payment 
we may receive up to an additional million in milestone payments 
in addition  we will receive royalty payments on future sales of zevalin 
as part of the overall agreement  we entered into a supply agreement with cti to sell zevalin product through our sales of zevalin to bayer schering pharma ag  or schering ag  for distribution in the eu will be recognized as product revenue and our supply of zevalin to cti is recognized as corporate partner revenue 
we will continue to receive royalty revenues from schering ag on their sales of zevalin in the eu 
the million upfront and million milestone payment have been deferred and are being recognized in our results of operations over the term of the supply agreement 
through april  we recorded product revenues from sales of amevive alefacept 
in april  we sold the worldwide rights to this product to astellas pharma us  inc  or astellas 
we will continue to manufacture and supply this product to astellas for a period of up to years 
under the terms of the supply agreement  we charge astellas fixed amounts based on volume 
such amounts will be recognized as corporate partner revenue and are not significant 
most of our revenues are currently dependent on sales of avonex  rituxan and tysabri 
in the near term  we are dependent on the continued sales growth of tysabri to grow our overall revenues 
in the longer term  our revenue growth is dependent on the successful clinical development  regulatory approval and launch of new commercial products currently being developed in our pipeline or products or programs that will be in licensed or acquired 
continued growth of global avonex unit sales is primarily dependent on maintaining avonex s position as the most prescribed multiple sclerosis  or ms  therapy in the world 
in both the us and rest of world  we face increasing competition in the ms market from currently marketed products and future products in late stage development  as well as increasing pricing pressure 
we continue to generate data showing avonex to be an effective and safe choice for ms patients and physicians 
the majority of rituxan unit sales are currently from use in the oncology setting 
we believe there is additional room for rituxan unit sales growth in the immunology setting  where rituxan is currently approved for patients with rheumatoid arthritis  or ra  with inadequate response to anti tumor necrosis factor therapies  or tnf ir 
additional immunology indications for rituxan that we are investigating include earlier stage ra patients with inadequate response to disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs  or dmard ir patients  dmard na ve ra patients and lupus nephritis and anca associated vaculitis 
in july  we reintroduced tysabri in the us and began to ship internationally for the first time 
tysabri sales are currently for use in relapsing remitting ms and  following the fda s approval in january  crohn s disease 
growth in tysabri revenue will be dependent on the generation of a larger and longer term safety database  as well as continued acceptance by physicians and ms patients 
since the reintroduction of tysabri in the us and the introduction of tysabri in the rest of world  we have disclosed five cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  or pml  a known side effect  in patients taking tysabri in the post 
table of contents marketing setting 
these patients were the only confirmed cases of pml reported to us during this period 
we continue to monitor the growth of tysabri unit sales in light of this news and we continue to develop protocols to potentially mitigate the risk and outcome of pml in patients being treated with tysabri 
clinical studies over the past few years  we have incurred significant expenditures related to conducting clinical studies to develop new pharmaceutical products and explore the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their labels 
for  we expect to continue to incur significant levels of research and development expenditures 
we have a number of pipeline products in late stage clinical trials  including over pipeline products in phase or phase clinical trials 
we are currently developing the late stage product candidates that are set forth below 
development and or marketing product product indications status collaborators bg relapsing ms phase none anti cd mab galiximab relapsed nhl phase none anti cd mab lumiliximab relapsed cll phase none humanized anti cd mab ocrelizumab ra phase us genentech japan chugai and zenyaku outside us and japan roche lupus nephritis phase see above lixivaptan hyponatremia  commonly seen in acute decompensated heart failure phase cardiokine biopharma llc adentri acute decompensated heart failure with renal insufficiency phase none in addition to the expense associated with these late stage trials  other pipeline products are in ongoing or are expected to enter proof of concept trials in business development as part of our business strategy  we have made acquisitions of other businesses  products  product rights or technologies and may continue to make acquisitions in the future 
our cash reserves and other liquid assets are substantial  but these sources of capital may be inadequate to consummate larger acquisitions and it may be necessary for us to raise substantial additional funds in the future to complete transactions 
due to the recent tightening of global credit and the disruption in the financial markets  it may be more difficult to secure such additional financing 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition efforts  we may experience significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses that may include transaction costs  closure costs or acquired in process research and development charges

these increases were offset by lower demand 
for compared to  rest of world sales of avonex increased million  or  primarily due to the impact of exchange rates and higher sales volume 
we expect to face increasing competition in the ms marketplace in both the us and rest of world from existing and new ms treatments  including tysabri and our other pipeline products  which may have a negative impact to the unit sales of avonex 
we expect future unit sales of avonex to be dependent to a large extent on our ability to compete successfully with the products of our competitors 
tysabri revenues from tysabri were as follows in millions year ended december  tysabri us rest of world total tysabri revenues under the terms of a collaboration agreement with elan  we manufacture tysabri and collaborate with elan on the product s marketing  commercial distribution and on going development activities

the increase in sales as compared to sales is primarily due to increased unit shipments due to the growth in the number of patients using tysabri 
for and  we have recorded revenue on sales of tysabri of million and million  respectively 
the increase in sales as compared to sales is primarily due to increased unit shipments due to the growth in the number of patients using tysabri and due to the product being shipped for the entire months during versus being shipped for only six months in during and  we had product on hand that had been fully written off in due to the uncertainties surrounding the tysabri suspension but which was available to fill future orders 
as we sold tysabri in and  we realized lower than normal cost of sales and  therefore  higher margins  as we shipped the inventory that had been previously written off 
for and  cost of sales was approximately million and million  respectively  lower due to the sale of tysabri that had been previously written off 
all tysabri inventory that had been previously written off had been shipped by december  during the year ended december   pursuant to our collaboration agreement with elan  elan paid us a million milestone payment in order to maintain the current collaboration profit sharing split 
we recorded this amount as deferred revenue upon receipt and are recognizing this million as product revenue in our consolidated statement of income over the term of our collaboration with elan based on a units of revenue method whereby the revenue recognized is based on the ratio of units shipped in the current period over the total units expected to be shipped over the remaining term of the collaboration 
we recognized million of this milestone as revenue for the year ended december  based on the tysabri sales levels achieved through the fourth quarter of  in january  elan paid us an additional milestone payment of million in order to maintain the current collaboration profit sharing split 
revenue from this milestone payment will also be deferred and recognized on a units of revenue model

table of contents amevive in   and  sales of amevive were million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease in total amevive sales is due to the sale  in april  of our worldwide rights and infrastructure related to sales  production  and marketing of amevive to astellas 
although we sold the rights to this product  we continue to report a small amount of product revenues related to shipments made by certain of our overseas joint ventures  which we consolidate 
provisions for discounts and allowances revenues from product sales are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues are recorded net of applicable allowances for trade term discounts  wholesaler incentives  medicaid rebates  veteran s administration  or va  rebates  managed care rebates  product returns  other applicable allowances and  in  patient assistance and patient replacement goods 
the estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent significant judgments 
effective january   we changed the manner in which we administer our patient assistance and patient replacement goods programs 
prior to january   avonex product shipped for these programs was invoiced and recorded as gross product revenue and an offsetting provision for discount and returns was recorded for expected credit requests from the distributor that administers these programs on our behalf as such  no net revenue was recorded for these shipments 
effective january   we entered into a new arrangement with a distributor 
under the new sales model  gross revenue is not recorded for product shipped to satisfy these programs  and cost of sales is recorded when the product is shipped

these estimates take into consideration our historical experience  current contractual requirements  statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns 
if actual results vary  we may need to adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment 
product revenue reserves are categorized as follows discounts  contractual adjustments and returns

revenues on sales of rituxan outside the us in   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
these increases were due to several factors  including increased market penetration 
the royalty period with respect to all products is years from the first commercial sale of such product on a country by country basis 
for the majority of european countries  the first commercial sale of rituxan occurred in the second half of therefore  we expect a significant decrease in royalty revenues on sales of rituxan outside the us and canada beginning in the latter half of specifically  the royalty period with respect to sales in france  spain  germany and the united kingdom will expire in as a result  royalty revenue is expected to be in the range of million to million in the royalty period with respect to sales in italy will expire in the royalty period with respect to sales in other countries will expire through under the amended and restated collaboration agreement  our current pretax co promotion profit sharing formula  which resets annually  is as follows biogen idec s share co promotion operating profits of co promotion profits first million greater than million in   and  the threshold was met during the first quarter

under our collaboration agreement with genentech  we will receive a lower royalty percentage of revenue from genentech on sales by roche and zenyaku of new anti cd products  as compared to the royalty percentage of revenue on sales of rituxan

as a result  included in product cost of revenues were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or that became obsolete due to expiration 
in all cases product inventory was written down to its estimated net realizable value 
the shelf life associated with our products is generally between and months  depending on the product 
obsolescence due to dating expiration has not been a historical concern  given the rapidity in which our products move through the channel 
changes due to our competitors price movements have not adversely affected us 
we do not provide incentives to our distributors to assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in their ordinary course of business

amortization of intangible assets for   and  amortization expense was million  million  and million  respectively 
our most significant intangible asset is the core technology related to our avonex product 
our amortization policy for our core technology intangible asset is based on the principles of statement of financial standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  which requires the amortization of intangible assets to reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed 
every year during the third quarter we complete our long range planning cycle  which includes an analysis of the anticipated product sales of avonex 
the results of this forecast serve as the basis for our assumptions used in the economic consumption amortization model for our core technology intangible asset 
we also establish minimum annual amortization amounts to ensure amortization charges are not unreasonably deferred to future periods 
see note  business overview and summary of significant accounting policies  for a detailed description of our accounting policy for amortization of intangible assets 
for compared to  amortization expense increased million  or  primarily due to the changes in the estimate of the future revenue of avonex  which serves as the basis for the calculation of economic consumption for core technology that occurred as part of our annual reassessment of amortization expense in the third quarters of and the change in the estimate of the future revenue of avonex is attributable to the expected impact of competitor products  including commercialization of our own pipeline product candidates 
for compared to  amortization expense decreased million  or  primarily due to the changes in estimate of the future revenue of avonex  which serves as the basis in our calculation of economic consumption for core technology 

table of contents we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable

in  we recorded an ipr d charge of million related to a hsp related milestone payment made to the former shareholders of conforma  pursuant to the terms of our acquisition of conforma in during the year ended december   we recorded ipr d charges of million 
the principal components of this amount are as follows million related to the acquisition of syntonix  approximately million related to the collaboration with cardiokine biopharma llc  or cardiokine and million related to the collaboration with neurimmune 
cardiokine and neurimmune are variable interest entities  as defined in fin r 
the consolidation of these entities resulted in ipr d charges 
the ipr d charges have been recorded as a component of operating income 
however  because the ipr d charges relate to the fair value of the underlying technology retained by the parent companies of cardiokine and neurimmune  these amounts were allocated to the respective minority interests

the collaboration agreement was entered into in october and required payments to fumapharm of certain royalty amounts 
the market rate for such payments was higher at the acquisition date  primarily due to the increased technical feasibility of bg the gain relates to the difference between the royalty rates at the time the agreement was entered into as compared to the rates at the time the agreement was effectively settled by virtue of our acquisition of fumapharm 

table of contents fumedica during  we recorded a charge of million in connection with a settlement agreement with fumedica arzneimittel ag and fumedica arzneimittel gmbh  collectively fumedica 
the charge related to the settlement of the agreement with fumedica under which we were contingently obligated to make royalty payments with respect to a successful launch of bg for psoriasis in germany 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we will not be required to make any royalty payments to fumedica if bg is successfully launched for psoriasis in germany

share based compensation expense in the year ended december  and  we recorded share based compensation expense of million  and million  respectively  associated with sfas r 
in the year ended december   we recorded share based compensation expense of million associated with sfas r  which is net of a cumulative effect pre tax adjustment of million  or million after tax 
the cumulative effect results from the application of an estimated forfeiture rate for current and prior period unvested restricted stock awards 
our share based compensation programs consist of share based awards granted to employees including stock options  restricted stock  performance based restricted stock units  and restricted stock units  or rsus  as well as our employee stock purchase plan  or espp

our effective tax rate was  and on pre tax income for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in was higher than that in  primarily due to an increased percentage of our foreign earnings being subject to us income tax and the effects of our reorganization of our international operations during  partially offset by certain tax credits and deferred tax assets which will be realized  as a result of our domestic reorganization 
our effective rate for was higher than the rate for primarily due to the write off of non deductible ipr d in connection with the acquisitions of conforma and fumapharm  offset by a non deductible gain on settlement of the fumapharm license agreement  and the impact of acquisition related intangible amortization related to foreign jurisdictions and state taxes  offset by the effect of lower income tax in certain non us jurisdictions

we also received million pursuant to our elan collaboration 
all of these milestone payments are included in cash from operations except the conforma payment which is included in investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
until required for use in the business  we invest our cash reserves in bank deposits  certificates of deposit  commercial paper  corporate notes  foreign and us government instruments  and other interest bearing marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy 
the value of these securities may be adversely affected which could impact our financial position and our overall liquidity 
in particular  the value of our investments may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates  downgrades in the corporate bonds included in our portfolio  instability in the global financial markets that reduces the liquidity of securities included in our portfolio  declines in the value of collateral underlying the mortgage  auto and credit card asset backed securities included in our portfolio  and by other factors which may result in other than temporary declines in value of the investments 
each of these events may cause us to record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio or sell investments for less than our acquisition cost 
we attempt to mitigate these risks with the assistance of our investment advisors by investing in high quality securities and continuously monitoring the overall risk profile of our portfolio 
we also maintain a well diversified portfolio that limits our credit exposure through concentration limits set within our investment policy 
as noted in note  fair value measurements  in notes to consolidated financial statements  a majority of our financial assets and liabilities have been classified as level these assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing third party pricing services 
the pricing services use many observable market inputs to determine value  including reportable trades  benchmark yields  credit spreads  broker dealer quotes  bids  offers  current spot rates  other industry  and economic events 
we validate the prices provided by our third party pricing services by understanding the models used  obtaining market values from other pricing sources  and analyzing pricing data in certain instances 
the fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts  interest rate swaps  debt instruments and plan assets for deferred compensation are based on market inputs and have been classified as level while we believe the valuation methodologies are appropriate  the use of valuation methodologies is highly judgmental and changes in methodologies can have a material impact on the values of these assets  our financial position  and overall liquidity

in june  we also entered into a five year million senior unsecured revolving credit facility  which we may use for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the bankruptcy of lehman brothers holdings inc in september has eliminated their million commitment  thereby reducing the availability of the credit facility to million 
the terms of this revolving credit facility include various covenants  including financial covenants that require us to not exceed a maximum leverage ratio and under certain circumstance  an interest coverage ratio

contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at december   we have funding commitments of up to approximately million as part of our investment in biotechnology oriented venture capital funds 
in addition  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties of up to approximately  million as part of our various collaborations including licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones had not occurred as of december   such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements 
we expect to make approximately million of milestone payments in at december   we have several clinical studies in various clinical trial stages 
our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to clinical research organizations  or cros 
the contracts with cros are generally cancellable  with notice  at our option 
we have recorded accrued expenses of million recorded in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet for work done by cros at december  we have approximately million in cancellable future commitments based on existing cro contracts at december  we do not have any significant relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements

legal matters see note  litigation  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of legal matters as of december  critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its critical estimates and judgments  including  among others  those related to revenue recognition  investments  inventory  research and development expenses  purchase accounting  goodwill impairment  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
those critical estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience  our observance of trends in the industry  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and accounts receivable product revenues we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues are recorded net of applicable reserves for trade term discounts  wholesaler incentives  medicaid rebates  va rebates  managed care rebates  product returns and other applicable allowances 
our product revenue reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
these estimates take into consideration our historical experience  current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns 
if actual results vary  we may need to adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment 
these estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent the most significant judgments that we make with regard to revenue recognition 
royalties we receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology developed by us or to which we have rights 
the license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of the licensed product 
we record these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period 
the relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties paid to us  adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
we maintain regular communication with our licensees in order to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period which they become known  typically the following quarter 
historically  adjustments have not been material based on actual amounts paid by licensees 

table of contents investments we invest in various types of securities  including short term and long term marketable securities  principally corporate notes  government securities and other asset backed securities  in which our excess cash balances are invested 
restrictions that limit the amount of investment exposure by institution  maturity and type are detailed in our investment policy 
the objectives of this policy are safety of principal  liquidity and lastly yield

 fair value measurement  or sfas  we have classified our financial assets and liabilities as level  or within the fair value hierarchy 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices  interest rates and yield curves 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset or liability 
as noted in note  fair value measurements  a majority of our financial assets and liabilities have been classified as level these assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing third party pricing services 
the pricing services use many observable market inputs to determine value  including reportable trades  benchmark yields  credit spreads  broker dealer quotes  bids  offers  current spot rates  other industry  and economic events 
we validate the prices provided by our third party pricing services by understanding the models used  obtaining market values from other pricing sources  and analyzing pricing data in certain instances 
we also have some investments classified as level whose fair value is initially measured at transaction prices and subsequently valued using the pricing of recent financing and or by reviewing the underlying economic fundamentals and liquidation value of the companies 
we apply judgments and estimates when we validate the prices provided by third parties 
while we believe the valuation methodologies are appropriate  the use of valuation methodologies is highly judgmental and changes in methodologies can have a material impact on our results of operations 
impairment in accounting for investments  we evaluate if a decline in the fair value of a marketable security below our cost basis is other than temporary  and if so  we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income 
the factors that we consider in our assessments for our investments in debt securities include the fair market value of the security  the duration of the security s decline  and our ability and intent to hold to maturity 
for our investments in equity securities  we consider the fair market value of the security  the duration of the security s decline as well as prospects for the investee  including favorable clinical trial results  new product initiatives  new collaborative agreements and our intent and ability to hold to recovery 
the determination of whether a loss is other than temporary is highly judgmental and can have a material impact on our financial results 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out  or fifo  method 
included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of pre clinical and clinical products  which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed 

table of contents our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval  when  based on management s judgment  future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized 
our accounting policy addresses the attributes that should be considered in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a product have met the definition of an asset as stipulated in fasb concepts statement no 
 elements of financial statements a replacement of fasb concepts no 
 or fasb concepts statement no 
we assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process including any known constraints and impediments to approval  including safety  efficacy and potential labeling restrictions 
we evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used 
we consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could possibly hamper approval or commercialization 
we consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or cause delay in commercialization 
we are sensitive to the significant commitment of capital to scale up production and to launch commercialization strategies 
we also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization  trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria 
finally  we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize 
there is a risk inherent in these judgments and any changes we make in these judgments may have a material impact on our results in future periods 
we periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
if the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us  or if there are any further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand  additional inventory write downs will be required 
additionally  our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring throughout the manufacturing process 
periodically  certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire 
as a result  included in costs of goods sold are write downs of commercial inventory that do not meet quality specifications or became obsolete due to expiration 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of upfront fees and milestones paid to collaborators and expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  facilities expenses  overhead expenses  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses  contract services and other outside expenses 
research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
the timing of upfront fees and milestone payments in the future may cause variability in future research and development expense 
clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with contract research organizations  or cros 
the invoicing from cros for services rendered can lag several months 
we accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with cro activities based on our estimate of site management  monitoring costs  and project management costs 
we maintain regular communication with our cro vendors to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
valuation of acquired intangible assets and in process research and development expenses we have acquired  and expect to continue to acquire  intangible assets primarily through the acquisition of biotechnology companies 
these intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in process product candidates 
when significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired  an independent third party valuation firm is generally engaged to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date 
management will determine the fair value of less significant identifiable intangible assets acquired 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations  and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  
table of contents estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
fin r under fin r  we consolidate variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary  we consider a number of factors  including determining the expected losses and residual returns of the technologies being developed pursuant to collaborations and other economic risk and reward of such collaborations 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these analyses and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to assuming that the research and development efforts will result in an approved commercial product  estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting timing of regulatory approvals  estimating future cash inflows from product sales or funding from partners resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
for such consolidated entities that we own less than a interest  we record minority interest in our statement of income for the current results allocated to the outside equity interests 
fin r impacts the way we account for certain collaborations and future events may result in our consolidation of companies or related entities with which we have a collaborative arrangement 
the consolidation of variable interest entities may have a material effect on our financial condition and or results of operation in future periods 
goodwill we annually assess our goodwill balance to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and  if so  the extent of such impairment 
to do this  in the case of goodwill we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units and compare it to the book value of their net assets 
calculating fair value involves identifying future cash flows  which requires that we make a number of critical legal  economic  market and business assumptions that reflect our best estimates as of the testing date 
we believe the methods we use to determine these underlying assumptions and estimates are reasonable 
notwithstanding this  our assumptions and estimates may differ significantly from actual results  or circumstances could change that would cause us to conclude that an impairment now exists or that we previously understated the extent of impairment 
share based compensation we make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our share based compensation 
in connection with valuing stock options and our employee stock purchase plan  we use the black scholes model  which requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions 
the key assumptions we make are the expected volatility of our stock  the expected term of the award  and the expected forfeiture rate 
in connection with our restricted stock programs  we make assumptions principally related to the forfeiture rate 
we review our valuation assumptions periodically and  as a result  we may change our valuation assumptions used to value share based awards granted in future periods 
such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share based payments 

table of contents income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in performing this assessment  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in making this determination  under the applicable financial accounting standards  we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and the effects of viable tax planning strategies 
our estimates of future taxable income include  among other items  our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates  we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
fasb interpretation no 
effective january   we adopted fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
as a result of the adoption of fin  we recognized a reduction in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million  which was recorded as a million reduction to the january  balance of our accumulated deficit  a million reduction in goodwill and a million increase in our deferred tax liability 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in millions balance at january additions based on tax positions related to the current period additions for tax positions of prior periods reductions for tax positions of prior periods settlements balance at december included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december   december   and january   are million  million  and million net of the federal benefit on state issues  respectively  of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective income tax rate in any future periods

table of contents we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk but do not engage in currency speculation 
we use these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar across all maturities for example  a strengthening of the euro would result in a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of forward contracts of approximately million 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account operating transactions 
certain of our debt instruments are variable rate instruments and our interest expense associated with these instruments is  therefore  subject to changes in market interest rates 
a basis point adverse movement increase in libor would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
in addition  the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates 
the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately million to our interest rate sensitive instruments 
the returns from cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will vary as short term interest rates change 
a basis point adverse movement decrease in short term interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately million 
we are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in our portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector 
we regularly review the market prices of these investments for impairment purposes 
a hypothetical adverse movement in market values would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately million
