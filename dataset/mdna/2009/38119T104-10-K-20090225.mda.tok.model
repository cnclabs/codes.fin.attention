table of contents glossary of terms we report our mineral reserves to two separate standards to meet the requirements for reporting in both canada and the united states us 
canadian reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by national instrument ni 
the definitions in ni are adopted from those given by the canadian institute of mining  metallurgy and petroleum 
us reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by the securities and exchange commission the sec industry guide these reporting standards have similar goals in terms of conveying an appropriate level of confidence in the disclosures being reported  but embody differing approaches and definitions 
we estimate and report our mineral resources and mineral reserves according to the definitions set forth in ni and modify them as appropriate to conform to sec industry guide for reporting in the us the definitions for each reporting standard are presented below with supplementary explanation and descriptions of the similarities and differences 
ni definitions mineral reserve the term mineral reserve refers to the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
the study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction can be justified 
a mineral reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined 
proven mineral reserve the term proven mineral reserve refers to the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
this study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction is justified 
probable mineral reserve the term probable mineral reserve refers to the economically mineable part of an indicated  and in some circumstances  a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
this study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction is justified 
mineral resource the term mineral resource refers to a concentration or occurrence of diamonds  natural solid inorganic material  or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals  coal  and industrial minerals in or on the earth s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction 
the location  quantity  grade  geological characteristics and continuity of a mineral resource are known  estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge 
measured mineral resource the term measured mineral resource refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity  grade or quality  densities  shape and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters  to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit 
the estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration  sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pits  workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity 
indicated mineral resource the term indicated mineral resource refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity  grade or quality  densities  shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters  to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit 
the estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pits  workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed 

table of contents inferred mineral resource the term inferred mineral resource refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed  but not verified  geological and grade continuity 
the estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pits  workings and drill holes 
qualified person the term qualified person refers to an individual who is an engineer or geoscientist with at least five years of experience in mineral exploration  mine development or operation or mineral project assessment  or any combination of these  has experience relevant to the subject matter of the mineral project and the technical report and is a member in good standing of a professional association 
sec industry guide definitions reserve the term reserve refers to that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
reserves must be supported by a feasibility study done to bankable standards that demonstrates the economic extraction 
bankable standards implies that the confidence attached to the costs and achievements developed in the study is sufficient for the project to be eligible for external debt financing 
a reserve includes adjustments to the in situ tonnes and grade to include diluting materials and allowances for losses that might occur when the material is mined 
proven reserve the term proven reserve refers to reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable reserve the term probable reserve refers to reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven measured reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling  and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
mineralized material the term mineralized material refers to material that is not included in the reserve as it does not meet all of the criteria for adequate demonstration for economic or legal extraction 
non reserves the term non reserves refers to mineralized material that is not included in the reserve as it does not meet all of the criteria for adequate demonstration for economic or legal extraction 
exploration stage an exploration stage prospect is one which is not in either the development or production stage 
development stage a development stage project is one which is undergoing preparation of an established commercially mineable deposit for its extraction but which is not yet in production 
this stage occurs after completion of a feasibility study 
production stage a production stage project is actively engaged in the process of extraction and beneficiation of mineral reserves to produce a marketable metal or mineral product 
industry guide does not require designation of a qualified person 
for industry guide purposes the feasibility study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction is justified 
this category is substantially equivalent to the combined categories of measured mineral resource and indicated mineral resource specified in ni

gold sales and production ghana has been a significant gold producing country for over years with anglogold ashanti s obuasi mine and our inactive underground mine at prestea historically being the two major producers 
several other areas in ghana have also produced significant amounts of gold 
annual gold production in ghana has exceeded two million ounces in recent years 
currently all our gold production is shipped to a south african gold refinery in accordance with a long term gold sales contract 
our gold is sold in the form of dor bars which average approximately gold by weight with the remaining portion being primarily silver 
the sales price is based on the london pm fix on the day of shipment to the refinery 
gold price history the price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors all of which are beyond our control such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions  inflation  recession  fluctuation in the relative values of the us dollar and foreign currencies  changes in global and regional gold demand  and the political and economic conditions of major gold producing countries throughout the world

mineral reserves our proven and probable mineral reserves are estimated in conformance with definitions set out in ni we have filed technical reports regarding the initial disclosure of mineral reserves and mineral resources for bogoso prestea and wassa hbb as required by ni the proven and probable mineral reserves are those ore tonnages contained within economically optimized pits  configured using current and predicted mining and processing methods and related operating costs and performance parameters 
we believe that our mineral reserves are estimated on a basis consistent with the definition of proven and probable reserves prescribed for use in the us by the us securities and exchange commission and set forth in sec industry guide see our glossary of terms 
in estimating mineral reserves  we first design an economically optimized pit based on all operating costs  including the costs to mine 
since all material lying within the optimized pit will be mined  the cut off grade used in determining our mineral reserves is estimated on the basis of material that  having been mined  is economic to transport and process without regard to primary mining costs ie mining costs that were appropriately applied at the economic optimization stage 
the qa qc controls program used in connection with the estimation of our mineral reserves consists of regular insertion and analysis of blanks and standards to monitor laboratory performance 
blanks are used to check for contamination 
standards are used to check for grade dependence biases

the terms non refractory and refractory refer to the metallurgical characteristics of the ore and are defined in the glossary of terms 
we plan to process the refractory ore in our sulfide bio oxidation plant at bogoso and to process the non refractory ore using our more traditional gravity  flotation and or cyanidation techniques 
optimized pit parameters are based on historical and projected operating costs at bogoso prestea  wassa and hwini butre and benso 
metallurgical recoveries are based on historical performance or estimated from test work and typically range between to for non refractory ores and between to for refractory ores 
pit designs are based on geotechnical criteria established by external consultants

where such a variance occurs it will arise from the differing requirements for reporting mineral reserves 
for example  ni has a minimum requirement that mineral reserves be supported by a pre feasibility study  whereas sec industry guide requires support from a detailed feasibility study that demonstrates that economic extraction is justified 
for the mineral reserves at december  and  there is no difference between the mineral reserves as disclosed under ni and those disclosed under sec industry guide  and therefore no reconciliation is provided

our inferred mineral resources have been estimated in compliance with definitions defined by ni golden star resources has filed technical reports regarding the initial disclosure of mineral reserves and mineral resources for bogoso prestea  wassa and the hbb properties as required by ni see our glossary of terms 
the total inferred mineral resources for all our open pit deposits are those ore tonnages contained within economically optimized pits  configured using current and predicted mining and processing methods and related operating costs and performance parameters 
except as otherwise indicated  the inferred mineral resources for all properties have been estimated at economic cut off grades based on gold prices of per ounce and per ounce as of december  and december   respectively  and economic parameters deemed realistic 
the following table summarizes estimated non reserves inferred mineral resources as of december  as compared to the total for december  property tonnes millions gold grade g t bogoso prestea prestea underground benso hwini butre chichiwelli manso goulagou paul isnard total total notes to non reserves inferred mineral resources table the inferred mineral resources for bogoso prestea incorporates pampe and mampon 

table of contents the inferred mineral resources were estimated in accordance with the definitions and requirements of canada s national instrument inferred mineral resources are not recognized by the united states securities and exchange commission 
the inferred mineral resources  other than for  goulagou and paul isnard  were estimated using an optimized pit shell at a gold price of per ounce from which the mineral reserves have been subtracted 
other than gold price  the same optimized pit shell parameters and modifying factors used to determine the mineral reserves were used to determine the mineral resources 
for goulagou and paul isnard optimized pit shells at a gold price of and were respectively used 
in  we used a gold price of per ounce for the optimized shell 
the prestea underground resource was estimated using an per ounce gold price and operating cost estimates 
the inferred mineral resources are not included in and are in addition to the mineral reserves described above 
the qualified person for the estimation of the inferred mineral resources is s 
mitchel wasel  golden star resources vice president of exploration 
numbers may not add due to rounding 
inferred mineral resources are shown on a basis 
the inferred mineral resources shown are subject to the government of ghana s carried interest which entitles it to a dividend once our capital costs have been recovered  in the case of bogoso prestea  wassa  hwini butre and benso 
the inferred mineral resources at prestea underground  are subject to the government of ghana s minority interest  with golden star currently having an beneficial interest 
pit optimization parameters for the goulagou inferred mineral resources were estimated based on feasibility studies on other similar gold deposits in burkina faso  golden star s experience in west africa  and from limited metallurgical test work on the goulagou ores 
heap leach processing was the assumed processing option for this deposit 
this property is held in trust for golden star 
see note to our financial statements in this december  form k 
the hwini butre inferred mineral resource includes million tonnes at a grade of g t which occurs below the pit shells and which we believe may be exploitable by under ground mining 
employees as of december   golden star  including our majority owned subsidiaries  had approximately  full time employees and approximately contract employees  for a total of  a increase from the approximately  people employed at the end of the total includes employees at our principal office in littleton  colorado and exploration personnel in south america 
customers currently all of our gold production is shipped to a south african gold refinery in accordance with a long term gold sales contract 
the refiner arranges for sale of the gold on the day it is shipped from the mine site and we receive payment for gold sold approximately three working days or less after the gold leaves the mine site 
the global gold market is competitive with numerous banks and refineries willing to buy gold on short notice 
therefore we believe that the loss of our current customers would not materially delay or disrupt revenues 
competition our competitive position depends upon our ability to successfully and economically explore  acquire and develop new and existing gold properties 
factors that allow gold producers to remain competitive in the market over the long term include the quality and size of ore bodies  cost of operation  and the acquisition and retention of qualified employees 
we compete with other mining companies and other natural mineral resource companies in the acquisition  exploration  financing and development of new mineral properties 
many of these companies are larger and better capitalized than we are 
there is significant competition for the limited number of gold acquisition and exploration opportunities 
we also compete with other mining companies for skilled mining engineers  mine and processing plant operators and mechanics  geologists  geophysicists and other technical personnel 

table of contents seasonality all of our operations are in tropical climates that experience annual rainy seasons 
ore output from our surface mining operations can be reduced during wet periods but mine plans are formulated to compensate for the periodic decreases and typically mining operations are not materially affected by rainy seasons 
exploration activities in ghana and in the guiana shield in south america are generally timed to avoid the rainy periods to ease transportation logistics associated with wet roads and swollen rivers 
in and early  decreases in rainfall in the volta river catchment basin resulted in reduced electric power availability from a hydroelectric power plant that produces a major portion of ghana s electric power 
during rainfall in ghana was within the normal range and adequate power was available

risk factors risk factors you should consider the following discussion of risks in addition to the other information contained in or included by reference in this form k 
in addition to historical information  the information in this form k contains forward looking statements about our future business and performance 
our actual operating results and financial performance may be very different from what we expect as of the date of this form k 
the risks below address material factors that may affect our future operating results and financial performance 
financial risks a substantial or prolonged decline in gold prices would have a material adverse effect on us 
the price of our common shares  our financial results and our exploration  development and mining activities have previously been  and would in the future be  significantly adversely affected by a substantial or prolonged decline in the price of gold 
the price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions  inflation or deflation  fluctuation in the value of the united states dollar and foreign currencies  global and regional demand  and the political and economic conditions of major gold producing countries throughout the world 
any drop in the price of gold adversely impacts our revenues  profits and cash flows 
in particular  a sustained low gold price could cause suspension of our mining operations at bogoso prestea  wassa and benso if these operations become uneconomic at the then prevailing gold price  thus further reducing revenues  cause us to be unable to fulfill our obligations under agreements with our partners or under our permits and licenses which could cause us to lose our interests in  or be forced to sell  some of our properties  cause us to be unable to fulfill our debt payment obligations  halt or delay the development of new projects  and reduce funds available for exploration  with the result that depleted mineral reserves are not replaced 
furthermore  the need to reassess the feasibility of any of our projects because of declining gold prices could cause substantial delays or could interrupt operations until a reassessment could be completed 
mineral reserve estimations and life of mine plans using significantly lower gold prices could result in reduced estimates of mineral reserves and non reserve mineral resources and in material write downs of our investment in mining properties and increased amortization  reclamation and closure charges 
we may incur substantial losses in the future that could make financing our operations and business strategy more difficult 
we experienced a net loss of million in and have experienced net losses in other prior fiscal years 
numerous factors  including declining gold prices  lower than expected ore grades or higher than expected operating costs  and impairment write offs of mine property and or exploration property costs  could cause us to continue to be unprofitable in the future 
future operating losses could make financing our operations and our business strategy  including pursuit of the growth opportunities anticipated at the hbb properties  or raising additional capital  difficult or impossible and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
our obligations could strain our financial position and impede our business strategy 
we had total consolidated debt and liabilities as of december  of million  including million payable to banks  million in equipment financing loans  million million including the loan s equity portion in convertible senior unsecured debentures maturing november   million of current trade payables  accrued current and other liabilities  million of future taxes  million of derivative liabilities and a million accrual for environmental rehabilitation liabilities 
our indebtedness and other liabilities may increase as a result of general corporate activities 
these liabilities could have important consequences  including the following increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  exploration costs and other general corporate requirements  
table of contents requiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments  which would reduce our ability to fund working capital  capital expenditures  exploration and other general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and placing us at a disadvantage when compared to our competitors that have less debt relative to their market capitalization 
our estimates of mineral reserves and non reserves could be inaccurate  which could cause production and costs to differ from estimates 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating proven and probable mineral reserves and non reserve measured  indicated and inferred mineral resources  including many factors beyond our control 
the accuracy of estimates of mineral reserves and non reserves is a function of the quantity and quality of available data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation  which could prove to be unreliable 
these estimates of mineral reserves and non reserves may not be accurate  and mineral reserves and non reserves may not be able to be mined or processed profitably 
fluctuation in gold prices  results of drilling  metallurgical testing  changes in operating costs  production  and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimate could require revision of the estimates 
the volume and grade of mineral reserves mined and processed and recovery rates might not be the same as currently anticipated 
any material reductions in estimates of our mineral reserves and non reserves  or of our ability to extract these mineral reserves and non reserves  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently have only two sources of operational cash flows  which could be insufficient by themselves to fund our continuing exploration and development activities 
while we have received significant infusions of cash from sales of equity and debt  our only current significant internal sources of funds are operational cash flows from bogoso prestea and wassa hbb 
the anticipated continuing exploration and development of our properties are expected to require significant expenditures over the next several years as we continue to focus on development of the hbb properties and prestea south and other deposits at bogoso 
although we expect sufficient internal cash flow to cover all of these projects  such expenditures may exceed free cash flows generated by bogoso prestea and wassa hbb in future years and therefore we may require additional external debt or equity financing 
our ability to raise significant new capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions  future gold prices  our operational performance and our then current cash flow and debt position  among other factors 
in light of the current limited global availability of credit  we may not be able to obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms or at all  which could cause us to delay or indefinitely postpone further exploration and development of our properties 
as a result  we could lose our interest in  or could be forced to sell  some of our properties 
we are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could materially adversely affect our financial position 
our revenues are in united states dollars  and we maintain most of our working capital in united states dollars or united states dollar denominated securities 
we convert our united states funds to foreign currencies as certain payment obligations become due 
accordingly  we are subject to fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the united states dollar and these foreign currencies  and these fluctuations could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
a significant portion of the operating costs at bogoso prestea and wassa hbb is based on the ghanaian currency  the cedi 
we are required to convert into cedis of the foreign exchange proceeds that we receive from selling gold  but the government of ghana could require us to convert a higher percentage of gold sales proceeds into cedis in the future 
in addition  we currently have future obligations that are payable in south african rand and euros  and receivables collectible in euros 
we obtain construction and other services and materials and supplies from providers in south africa and other countries 
the costs of goods and services could increase or decrease due to changes in the value of the united states dollar or the cedi  euros  the south african rand or other currencies 
consequently  operation and development of our properties could be more costly than anticipated 
in the past  we have entered into forward purchase contracts for south african rand and australian dollars to hedge expected purchase of capital assets in south africa and australia 
as of february  we had no currency related derivatives 
our hedging activities might be unsuccessful and incur losses 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we entered into gold forward price contracts in response to a significant increase in recent gold price volatility 
all of these contracts had terms of days or less 
all of the contracts entered into in the third quarter expired by december  all of the contracts entered into during the fourth quarter of will expire by march  these hedges and any further hedging activities might not protect adequately against declines in the price of gold 
in addition  although a hedging program could protect us from a decline in the price of gold  it might also prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases 
for example  as part of a hedging program  we could be obligated to sell gold at a price lower than the then current market price 

table of contents risks inherent in acquisitions that we might undertake could adversely affect our current business and financial condition and our growth 
we plan to continue to pursue the acquisition of producing  development and advanced stage exploration properties and companies 
the search for attractive acquisition opportunities and the completion of suitable transactions are time consuming and expensive  divert management attention from our existing business and may be unsuccessful 
success in our acquisition activities depends on our ability to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms and integrate the acquired operations successfully with our operations 
any acquisition would be accompanied by risks 
for example  there may be a significant change in commodity prices after we have committed to complete a transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio  a material ore body may prove to be below expectations or the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant 
we may lose the services of our key employees or the key employees of any business we acquire or have difficulty integrating operations and personnel 
the integration of an acquired business or assets may disrupt our ongoing business and our relationships with employees  suppliers and contractors 
any one or more of these factors or other risks could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition of properties or companies  and could have a material adverse effect on our current business and financial condition and on our ability to grow 
we are subject to litigation risks 
all industries  including the mining industry  are subject to legal claims  with and without merit 
we are currently involved in litigation relating to crop compensation  transfer of ownership of an exploration project and to the validity of various concession contracts and settlements related to the hwini butre concession 
we believe these actions are frivolous and entirely without merit  and we are vigorously defending against these action on numerous grounds 
we are also involved in various routine legal proceedings incidental to our business 
defense and settlement costs can be substantial  even with respect to claims that have no merit 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process  the resolution of any particular legal proceeding could have a material effect on our future financial position and results of operations 
operational risks we are subject to a number of operational events that can delay production or result in liability to us 
our activities are subject to a number of risks and hazards including power shortages  mechanical and electrical equipment failures  parts availability  unexpected changes in ore grades unexpected changes in ore chemistry and gold recoverability environmental hazards  discharge of pollutants or hazardous chemicals  industrial accidents  labor disputes and shortages  supply and shipping problems and delays  shortage of equipment and contractor availability  unusual or unexpected geological or operating conditions  cave ins of underground workings  slope failures and failure of pit walls or dams  fire  marine and transit damage and or loss  changes in the regulatory environment  and natural phenomena such as inclement weather conditions  floods  droughts and earthquakes 
these or other occurrences could result in damage to  or destruction of  mineral properties or production facilities  personal injury or death  environmental damage  delays in mining  delayed production  monetary losses and possible legal liability 
satisfying such liabilities could be very costly and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents our mining operations are subject to numerous environmental laws  regulations  permitting requirements and bonding requirements that can delay production and adversely affect operating and development costs 
compliance with existing regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to environmental protection  in the jurisdictions where we have projects may have a material adverse effect on our exploration activities  results of operations and competitive position 
new or expanded regulations  if adopted  could affect the exploration  development  or operation of our projects or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations 
a significant portion of our dunkwa property and portions of our wassa property  as well as some of our exploration properties in ghana  are located within forest reserve areas 
although dunkwa and wassa have been identified by the government of ghana as eligible for mining permits  subject to normal procedures and a site inspection  permits for projects in forest reserve areas may not be issued in a timely fashion  or at all  and such permits may contain special requirements with which it is burdensome or uneconomic to comply 
mining and processing gold from the south end of the prestea property and from the mampon property as well as the other planned activities will require mining  environmental  and other permits and approvals from the government of ghana 
these permits and approvals may not be issued on a timely basis or at all  and such permits and approvals  when issued  may be subject to requirements or conditions with which it is burdensome or uneconomic to comply 
such permitting issues could adversely affect our projected production commencement dates  production amounts and costs 
our pit at dumasi will require us to implement a resettlement action plan and reach agreements with the residents that live close to the pits 
these negotiations could be difficult or unsuccessful and may materially affect our ability to access these mineral reserves and mineral resources 
due to an increased level of non governmental organization activity targeting the mining industry in ghana  the potential for the government of ghana to delay the issuance of permits or impose new requirements or conditions upon mining operations in ghana may increase 
any changes in the government of ghana s policies may be costly to comply with and may delay mining operations 
the exact nature of other environmental control problems  if any  which we may encounter in the future cannot be predicted  primarily because of the changing character of environmental requirements that may be enacted within various jurisdictions 
as a result of the foregoing risks  project expenditures  production quantities and rates and cash operating costs  among other things  could be materially and adversely affected and could differ materially from anticipated expenditures  production quantities and rates  and costs 
in addition  estimated production dates could be delayed materially 
any such events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the development and operation of our mining projects involve numerous uncertainties that could affect the feasibility or profitability of such projects 
mine development projects  including our recent development at benso and expansion at bogoso prestea typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible 
development projects are subject to the completion of successful feasibility studies and environmental and socioeconomic assessments  issuance of necessary governmental permits and receipt of adequate financing 
the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors such as estimation of mineral reserves and mineral resources  mining rate  dilution and recovery  anticipated metallurgical characteristics of the ore and gold recovery rates  environmental and community considerations  permitting and approvals  future gold prices  and anticipated capital and operating costs 
estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves and operating costs developed in feasibility studies are based on reasonable assumptions including geologic and engineering analyses and might not prove to be accurate 
the management of mine development projects and start up of new operations are complex 
completion of development and the commencement of production may be subject to delays  as occurred at wassa and in connection with the bogoso sulfide expansion project 
any of the following events  among others  could affect the profitability or economic feasibility of a project unanticipated changes in grade and tonnage of ore to be mined and processed  unanticipated adverse geotechnical conditions  
table of contents incorrect data on which engineering assumptions are made  costs of constructing and operating a mine in a specific environment  cost of processing and refining  availability of economic sources of power  availability of qualified staff  adequacy of water supply  adequate access to the site including competing land uses such as agriculture and illegal mining  unanticipated transportation costs and shipping incidents and losses  significant increases in the cost of diesel fuel  cyanide or other major components of operating costs  government regulations including regulations relating to prices  royalties  duties  taxes  permitting  restrictions on production  quotas on exportation of minerals  protection of the environment and agricultural lands  including bonding requirements  fluctuations in gold prices  and accidents  labor actions and force majeure events 
adverse effects on the operations or further development of a project could also adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
because of these uncertainties  and others identified in these risk factors  our production estimates at bogoso prestea and wassa may not be achieved 
we need to continually discover  develop or acquire additional mineral reserves for gold production and a failure to do so would adversely affect our business and financial position in the future 
because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable mineral reserves  we must continually replace and expand mineral reserves as our mines produce gold 
we are required to estimate mine life in connection with our estimation of reserves  but our estimates may not be correct 
in addition  mine life would be shortened if we expand production or if we lose reserves due to changes in gold price or operating costs 
our ability to maintain or increase our annual production of gold will be dependent in significant part on our ability to bring new mines into production and to expand or extend the life of existing mines 
gold exploration is highly speculative  involves substantial expenditures  and is frequently non productive 
gold exploration  including the exploration of the prestea underground and other projects  involves a high degree of risk 
exploration projects are frequently unsuccessful 
few prospects that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines 
we cannot assure you that our gold exploration efforts will be successful 
the success of gold exploration is dependent in part on the following factors the identification of potential gold mineralization based on surface analysis  availability of prospective land  availability of government granted exploration and exploitation permits  the quality of our management and our geological and technical expertise  and the funding available for exploration and development 
substantial expenditures are required to determine if a project has economically mineable mineralization 
it could take several years to establish proven and probable mineral reserves and to develop and construct mining and processing facilities 
as a result of these uncertainties  we cannot assure you that current and future exploration programs will result in the discovery of mineral reserves  the expansion of our existing mineral reserves and the development of mines 

table of contents we face competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties 
we face strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties producing  or capable of producing  gold 
many of these companies have greater financial resources  operational experience and technical capabilities 
as a result of this competition  we might be unable to maintain or acquire attractive mining properties on terms we consider acceptable or at all 
consequently  our future revenues  operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
title to our mineral properties could be challenged 
we seek to confirm the validity of our rights to title to  or contract rights with respect to  each mineral property in which we have a material interest 
we have mining leases with respect to our bogoso prestea  wassa  prestea underground and hbb properties 
as of february  our mineral rights at the paul isnard gold property in french guiana and various concession contracts and settlements related to the hwini butre concession are being challenged by third parties 
although we are vigorously defending these challenges  we cannot guarantee that title to our properties will not be challenged 
title insurance generally is not available  and our ability to ensure that we have obtained a secure claim to individual mineral properties or mining concessions is limited 
we generally do not conduct surveys of our properties until they have reached the development stage  and therefore  the precise area and location of such properties could be in doubt 
accordingly  our mineral properties could be subject to prior unregistered agreements  transfers or claims  and title could be affected by  among other things  undetected defects 
in addition  we might be unable to operate our properties as permitted or to enforce our rights with respect to our properties 
we depend on the services of key executives 
we are dependent on the services of key executives including our president and chief executive officer and a small number of highly skilled and experienced executive personnel 
due to the relatively small size of our management team  the loss of one or more of these persons or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations 
our insurance coverage could be insufficient 
our business is subject to a number of risks and hazards generally  including adverse environmental conditions  industrial accidents  labor disputes  unusual or unexpected geological conditions  ground or slope failures  cave ins  changes in the regulatory environment  marine transit and shipping damage and or losses  natural phenomena such as inclement weather conditions  floods and earthquakes  and political risks including expropriation and civil war 
such occurrences could result in damage to mineral properties or production facilities and equipment  personal injury or death  loss of legitimate title to properties  environmental damage to our properties or the properties of others  delays in mining  processing and development  monetary losses  and possible legal liability 
although we maintain insurance in amounts that we believe to be reasonable  our insurance might not cover all the potential risks associated with our business 
we might also be unable to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums 
insurance coverage might not continue to be available or might not be adequate to cover any resulting liability 
moreover  insurance against risks such as environmental pollution or other hazards as a result of exploration and production is not generally available to us 
table of contents or to other companies in the mining industry on acceptable terms 
we might also become subject to liability for pollution or other hazards which we cannot insure against or which we might elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons 
losses from these events might cause us to incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance and results of operations 
governmental and regulatory risks as a holding company  limitations on the ability of our operating subsidiaries to make distributions to us could adversely affect the funding of our operations 
we are a holding company that conducts operations through foreign principally ghanaian subsidiaries and joint ventures  and substantially all of our assets consist of equity in these entities 
accordingly  any limitation on the transfer of cash or other assets between the parent corporation and these entities  or among these entities  could restrict our ability to fund our operations efficiently  or to repay our convertible notes or other debt 
any such limitations  or the perception that such limitations might exist now or in the future  could have an adverse impact on available credit and our valuation and stock price 
we are subject to changes in the regulatory environment where we operate which may increase our costs of compliance 
our mining operations and exploration activities are subject to extensive regulation governing various matters  including licensing  production  taxes  disposal of process water or waste rock  toxic substances  development and permitting  exports and imports  labor standards  mine and occupational health and safety  environmental protection and corporate responsibility  and mine reclamation and closure plans 
compliance with these regulations increases the costs of the following planning  designing  drilling  operating  developing  constructing  and closure  reclamation and rehabilitation 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations in ghana and elsewhere 
however  these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and reinterpretation amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities of mining companies or more stringent implementation or interpretation of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on us 
these factors could cause a reduction in levels of production and delay or prevent the development or expansion of our properties in ghana 
the implementation of changes in regulations that limit the amount of proceeds from gold sales that could be withdrawn from ghana could also have a material adverse impact on us  as bogoso prestea and wassa are currently our only sources of internally generated operating cash flows 

table of contents environmental bonding requirements are under review in ghana and bonding requirements may be increased 
as part of its periodic assessment of mine reclamation and closure costs  the epa reviews the adequacy of reclamation bonds and guarantees 
in certain cases it has requested higher levels of bonding based on its findings 
if the epa were to require additional bonding at our properties  it may be difficult  if not impossible  to provide sufficient bonding given the current disruptions in the world financial markets 
if we are unable to meet any such increased requirements or negotiate an acceptable solution with the ghanaian government  our operations and exploration and development activities in ghana may be materially adversely affected 
the government of ghana has the right to increase its interest in certain subsidiaries 
in accordance with the minerals and mining act  act  the government of ghana has a carried interest in the mineral operations of ghanaian mining companies 
the carried interest comes into existence at the time the government issues a mining license 
as such  the government of ghana currently has a carried interest in our subsidiaries that own the bogoso prestea mine  the hbb properties  the wassa mine  and the prestea underground property 
under act  the government has the right to acquire a special share or golden share in such subsidiaries at any time for no consideration or such consideration as the government of ghana and such subsidiaries might agree  and a pre emptive right to purchase all gold and other minerals produced by such subsidiaries 
a golden share carries no voting rights and does not participate in dividends  profits or assets 
while the government of ghana has not sought to exercise any of these rights at our properties  any such attempts to do so in the future could adversely affect our financial results 
we are subject to risks relating to exploration  development and operations in various countries 
our assets and operations are affected by various political and economic uncertainties in the countries where we operate  including war  civil unrest  terrorism  coups or other violent or unexpected changes in government  political instability and violence  expropriation and nationalization  renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions  licenses  permits  and contracts  illegal mining  changes in taxation policies  restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation  and changing political conditions  currency controls  and governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
illegal mining has occurred on our properties  is difficult to control  can disrupt our business and can expose us to liability 
we continue to experience illegal mining activity on our mining and exploration properties 
most of this activity is on our prestea south and hwini butre properties 
while we are proactively working with local  regional and national governmental authorities to obtain protection of our property rights  any action on the part of such authorities may not occur  may not fully address our problems or may be delayed 
in addition to the impact on our mineral reserves and non reserves  the presence of illegal miners can lead to project delays and disputes and delays regarding the development or operation of commercial gold deposits 
the work performed by the illegal miners could cause environmental damage or other damage to our properties  or personal injury or death  for which we could potentially be held responsible 
illegal miners may work on other of our properties from time to time  and they may in the future increase their presence and have increased negative impacts such as those described above on such other properties 
our activities are subject to complex laws  regulations and accounting standards that can adversely affect operating and development costs  the timing of operations  the ability to operate and financial results 
our business  mining operations and exploration and development activities are subject to extensive canadian  united states  ghanaian and other foreign  federal  state  provincial  territorial and local laws and regulations governing exploration  development  production  exports  taxes  labor standards  waste disposal  protection of the environment  reclamation  historic and cultural resource preservation  mine safety and occupational health  toxic substances  reporting and other matters  as well as accounting standards 
compliance with these laws  regulations and standards or the imposition of new such requirements could adversely affect operating and development costs  the timing of operations  the ability to operate and financial results 

table of contents failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price 
we are required to annually test our internal control over financial reporting to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price 
market risks the market price of our common shares has experienced volatility and could continue to do so in the future 
our common shares are listed on the nyse alternext us  the toronto stock exchange and the ghana stock exchange 
companies with market capitalizations similar to ours have experienced substantial volatility in the past  often based on factors unrelated to the financial performance or prospects of the companies involved 
these factors include macroeconomic developments in north america and globally and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries 
our share price is also likely to be significantly affected by short term changes in gold prices or in our financial condition or results of operations as reflected in our quarterly earnings reports 
other factors unrelated to our performance that could have an effect on the price of our common shares include the following the extent of analytical coverage available to investors concerning our business could be limited if investment banks with research capabilities do not continue to follow our securities  the trading volume and general market interest in our securities could affect an investor s ability to trade significant numbers of common shares  the size of the public float in our common shares may limit the ability of some institutions to invest in our securities  and a substantial decline in our stock price that persists for a significant period of time could cause our securities to be delisted from the nyse alternext us and the toronto stock exchange further reducing market liquidity 
as a result of any of these factors  the market price of our common shares at any given point in time might not accurately reflect our long term value 
the stock markets in general have recently suffered major declines 
securities class action litigation often has been brought against companies following periods of market price volatility that affects the market price of particular securities without regard to the performance of the company whose stock price is affected 
we could in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and damages and divert management s attention and resources 
investors could have difficulty or be unable to enforce certain civil liabilities on us  certain of our directors and our experts 
golden star is a canadian corporation 
substantially all of our assets are located outside of canada and the united states  and our head office is located in the united states 
it might not be possible for investors to collect judgments obtained in canadian courts predicated on the civil liability provisions of canadian or us securities legislation 
it could also be difficult for you to effect service of process in connection with any action brought in the united states upon our directors and officers 
execution by united states courts of any judgment obtained against us  or any of the directors or executive officers  in the united states courts would be limited to our assets or the assets of such persons in the united states 
the enforceability in canada of united states judgments or liabilities in original actions in canadian courts predicated solely upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states is doubtful 
there are certain us federal income tax risks associated with ownership of golden star common shares 
holders of our common shares  warrants or options to purchase our common shares or convertible debentures collectively  equity securities who are us taxpayers should consider that we could be considered to be a passive foreign investment company pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
although we believe that we were not a pfic for  and do not expect to become a pfic in and in the foreseeable future  the tests for determining pfic status depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  and can be subject to uncertainties  and we cannot assure you that we will not be a pfic 
we undertake no obligation to advise holders of our equity securities as to our pfic status for any year 
if we are a pfic for any year  any person who holds our equity securities who is a us person for us income tax purposes a us holder and whose holding period for those equity securities includes any portion of a year in which we are a pfic generally would be subject to a special adverse tax regime in respect of excess distributions 
excess distributions include certain distributions received with respect to pfic shares in a taxable year 
gain recognized by a us holder on a sale or other transfer of our equity 
table of contents securities including certain transfers that would otherwise be tax free also would be treated as an excess distributions 
such excess distributions and gains would be allocated ratably to the us holder s holding period 
for these purposes  the holding period of shares acquired either through an exercise of warrants or options or the conversion of convertible debentures includes the holder s holding period in the warrant  option or convertible debt 
the portion of any excess distribution including gains treated as excess distributions allocated to the current year would be includible as ordinary income in the current year 
the portion of any excess distribution allocated to a prior years would be taxed at the highest marginal rate applicable to ordinary income for each such year regardless of the taxpayer s actual marginal rate for that year and without reduction by any losses or loss carryforwards and would be subject to interest charges to reflect the value of the us income tax deferral 
elections may be available to mitigate the adverse tax rules that apply to pfics the so called qef and mark to market elections  but these elections may accelerate the recognition of taxable income and may result in the recognition of ordinary income 
the qef and mark to market elections are not available to us holders with respect to warrants or options to acquire our common shares or convertible debentures 
we have not decided whether we would provide to us holders of our common shares the annual information that would be necessary to make the qef election 
additional special adverse rules also apply to investors who are us holders who own our common shares if we are a pfic and have a non us subsidiary that is also a pfic 
special adverse rules that impact certain estate planning goals could apply to our equity securities if we are a pfic 
the conversion feature of our convertible senior unsecured debentures could limit increases in the trading price of our common shares 
the conversion price of our convertible senior unsecured debentures due november is and represented a premium over the closing price of the common shares on the nyse alternext us on october   the day prior to commencement of the debenture offering 
in the event our share price is greater than the conversion price  this conversion feature may limit the increase in the price of our common shares  since any increase in the stock price above the conversion price will make it more likely that debentures will be converted  thereby exerting a downward pressure on the market price of the common shares 
the existence of outstanding rights to purchase or acquire common shares could impair our ability to raise capital 
as of february   approximately million common shares are issuable on exercise of options to purchase common shares at prices ranging from cdn to cdn 
in addition  million common shares are currently issuable upon conversion of our convertible senior unsecured debentures due in november additional shares may be issuable in certain circumstances 
during the life of the options  debentures and other rights  the holders are given an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of common shares  with a resulting dilution in the interest of the other shareholders 
our ability to obtain additional financing during the period such rights are outstanding could be adversely affected  and the existence of the rights could have an adverse effect on the price of our common shares 
the holders of the options  debentures and other rights can be expected to exercise or convert them at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able to obtain any needed capital by a new offering of securities on terms more favorable than those provided by the outstanding rights 
current global financial condition may impact our ability to obtain financing and may negatively affect our asset values and results of operations 
current global financial conditions have been characterized by increased volatility and several financial institutions have either gone into bankruptcy or have had to be rescued by governmental authorities 
access to public financing has been negatively impacted by both the rapid decline in value of sub prime mortgages and the liquidity crisis affecting the asset backed commercial paper market 
these factors may impact our ability to obtain equity or debt financing in the future on favorable terms 
additionally  these factors  as well as other related factors  may cause decreases in asset values that are deemed to be other than temporary  which may result in impairment losses 
if such increased levels of volatility and market turmoil continue  our operations could be adversely impacted and the trading price of the common shares may be adversely affected

table of contents mining in ghana ghanaian ownership and special rights ghana is situated on the west coast of africa  approximately kilometers north of the equator on the gulf of guinea 
accra  the capital city of ghana  is located on the prime meridian 
following a period as a british colony  ghana achieved independence in and it is now a republic with a democratically elected government 
ghana has a population of approximately million people 
english is the official and commercial language 
the total land area of the country is approximately  square kilometers and the topography is relatively flat 
ghana has a tropical climate with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year in the western region 
rights to explore and develop a mine are administered by the minister of lands  forestry and mines through the minerals commission  a governmental organization designed to promote and control the development of ghana s mineral wealth in accordance with the minerals and mining act of act  which came into effect in march the act 
a company or individual can apply to the minerals commission for a renewable exploration license granting exclusive rights to explore for a particular mineral in a selected area for an initial period not exceeding three years 
when exploration has successfully delineated a mineral reserve  an application may be made to the minerals commission for conversion to a mining lease  granting a company the right to produce a specific product from the concession area  normally for a period of to years 
production must typically begin within two years of the date of grant of a mining lease 
the act  requires that any person who intends to acquire a controlling share of the equity of any mining company that has been granted a mining lease must first give notice of its intent to the government and obtain its consent prior to acquiring a controlling share 
under the act  the government of ghana continues to hold a carried interest in all companies that hold mining leases 
the carried interest entitles the government to a pro rata share of future dividends 
the government has no obligation to contribute development capital or operating expenses 
gsbpl and gswl owe million and million  respectively  to golden star or its subsidiaries as of december  for past advances and interest on these advances  and these amounts would be repaid before payment of any dividends 
under the act  the government of ghana continues to be entitled to acquire a special or golden share in any mining company at any time for no consideration or for such consideration as the government and the mining company might agree 
the special share would constitute a separate class of shares with such rights as the government and the mining company might agree 
in the absence of such agreement  the special share would have the following rights it would carry no voting rights  but the holder would be entitled to receive notice of and to attend and speak at any general meeting of the members or any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares  it could only be issued to  held by  or transferred to the government or a person acting on behalf of the government  the written consent of the holder would be required for all amendments to the organizational documents of the company  the voluntary winding up or liquidation of the company or the disposal of any mining lease or the whole or any material part of the assets of the company  it would not confer a right to participate in the dividends  profits or assets of the company or a return of assets in a winding up or liquidation of the company  the holder of a special share may require the company to redeem the special share at any time for no consideration or for a consideration determined by the company 
gsbpl and gswl have not issued nor to date been requested to issue a special share to the government of ghana 
the government of ghana has a pre emptive right to purchase all gold and other minerals produced by mines in ghana 
the purchase price would be agreed by the government of ghana and the mining company  or the price established by any gold hedging arrangement between and any third party approved by the government  or the publicly quoted market price prevailing for the minerals or products as delivered at the mine or plant where the right of preemption was exercised 
the government of ghana has agreed to take no preemptive action pursuant to its right to purchase gold or other minerals so long as mining companies sell gold in accordance with certain procedures approved by the bank of ghana 
ghanaian royalty requirements the holder of a mining lease is required to pay quarterly a royalty of not less than and not more than of gold revenues 
the government of ghana determines the royalty percentage each year based on the ratio that the operating margin bears to the value of gold produced from a mining lease in that year 
based on the mineral royalty regulation currently in force  the royalty is when 
table of contents the operating ratio is or less  and increases for each increase in operating ratio until it reaches a maximum of at an operating ratio of 
in  and the royalty rate for gsbpl was of revenues and gsbpl paid million  million and  million  respectively 
the royalty payments from gsbpl have not exceeded per annum in any year 
gswl paid a royalty of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
ghanaian environmental regulations environmental matters in ghana  including those related to mining  fall under the oversight of the environmental protection agency epa  with some responsibilities lying with the minerals commission 
the epa has rules and guidelines that govern environmental impact statements  environmental management plans  mine operations  and mine closure and reclamation  to which our operations are subject 
additional provisions governing surface uses by our stakeholders are provided in the act 
in  pursuant to a reclamation bonding agreement between the epa and gswl  we bonded million to cover future reclamation obligations at wassa 
to meet the bonding requirements  we established a million letter of credit and deposited million of cash with the epa 
pursuant to a further bonding agreement between the epa and gsbpl  we bonded million in early to cover our future obligations at bogoso prestea 
to meet these requirements  we deposited million of cash with the epa with the balance covered by a letter of credit 
in the bond was increased by million to cover the pampe mining site 
in  the epa required bogoso prestea to resubmit their environmental management plan emp with an updated estimate of the reclamation and closure costs prepared by a third party consultant 
a consultant was commissioned to prepare the cost estimate and the emp was submitted to the epa in february  we are currently waiting for the epa s review and comments 
reclamation activities were ongoing at both wassa and bogoso prestea during to rehabilitate disturbed lands and reduce some of the long term liabilities including re profiling waste dumps  capping hard rock with oxide materials  topsoil spreading and planting for both slope stabilization and long term rehabilitation 
our consolidated reclamation expenditures totaled million  million and million respectively in  and we believe all our operations in ghana are currently in substantial compliance with all environmental requirements 
environmental laws and regulations all phases of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we operate 
these regulations may define  among other things  air and water quality standards  waste management requirements  and land rehabilitation obligations 
in general  environmental legislation is evolving to require stricter operating standards  more detailed social and environmental assessments of proposed projects  and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers  directors  and employees for social responsibility and safety 
future changes in environmental regulations  will likely affect the way in which we operate  resulting in higher environmental and social operating costs that may affect the viability of our operations 
we use hazardous chemicals in our gold recovery activities that result in the generation of environmental contaminants that may adversely affect air and water quality 
to mitigate these effects  we have established objectives in meeting  or surpassing  regulatory requirements in all of our exploration  development  operation  closure  and post closure activities so that the local environment and communities are protected and that the post closure land use contributes to the sustainability of the local economy 
in order to meet our objectives  we have educated our leaders and managers so that they are committed to creating a culture that makes social and environmental matters an integral part of the short and long term operations and performance management systems  worked with our employees so that they understand and accept environmental and social policies and procedures as a fundamental part of the business  signed the international cyanide management code the code  implemented the code aiming to ensure that our established policies and procedures adhere to the code s best practices  established  or are in the process of establishing  operating standards and procedures that aim to meet or exceed requirements in relevant laws and regulations  the commitments made in our environmental impact statements  environmental and socioeconomic management plans  rehabilitation and closure plans  and any international protocols to which we are a signatory  incorporated environmental performance requirements into all relevant contracts  provided training to employees and contractors in environmental matters  regularly prepared  reviewed  updated and implemented site specific environmental management and closure plans  worked to progressively rehabilitate disturbed areas in conformance with the site specific environmental management and closure plans  
table of contents consulted local communities and regulators to provide us with input to our environmental management policies and procedures  regularly reviewed our environmental performance  and publicly reported our social  health  safety  and environmental performance 
governmental approvals and permits are currently required and will likely continue to be required in the future in connection with our operations 
to the extent that such approvals are required and not obtained  we could be limited or prohibited from continuing our mining and processing operations or from proceeding with planned exploration or the development of mineral properties 
our mining  processing  development and mineral exploration activities are subject to various laws governing prospecting  development  production  taxes  labor standards  occupational health and safety  land claims of local people and other matters 
new rules and regulations may be enacted or existing rules and regulations may be applied in a manner that could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
corporate social responsibility in keeping with our health and safety  environmental  community relations and human rights policies  we strive at all times to conduct our business as a responsible corporate citizen 
we believe our ongoing success in ghana depends on our continuing efforts to build good relations with our local stakeholder communities and by incorporating broader stakeholder comments and addressing their concerns in our developing projects and ongoing operations 
we believe our success as an employer  as a neighbor and as an important part of the local economy is furthered by contributing to the diversification of the local economy with projects such as our oil palm project and by our support of community driven projects through our development foundation 
during  the development foundation worked with the local community mine consultation committees to fund and sponsor several community driven projects including a medical clinic  scholarships for local students  a police station and school buildings 
the oil palm project continued to attract much favorable attention during and approximately doubled in size during the year 
in july  the first bogoso plantation plots were handed over to plot holders in a ceremony attended by the minister of lands  forestry  and mines  and presided over by the paramount chief 
in all  people were assigned hectare plots within the plantation 
further plantation development and oversight will remain with golden star but the ongoing work on the farms and profits generated will be assigned to the individual plot holders 
to further transparency  a full suite of procedures governing the operation of project is now being implemented 
for its community efforts  the project was designated as the first project outside south africa to be honored with the prestigious nedbank green mining award 
our commitment to the development of our stakeholder communities demonstrates golden star s dedication to ghana and to sharing the success of our operations with our local communities 
as we continue to expand the oil palm project  we will integrate more local people and communities into our economic development and outreach programs  so assisting the western region of ghana to achieve its full potential within the broader ghana development 
operating properties the bogoso prestea gold mine bogoso prestea consists of a gold mining and processing operation located along the ashanti trend in western ghana  approximately kilometers northwest of the town of tarkwa 
it can be reached by paved roads from tarkwa  a local commercial center  and from accra  the capital of ghana 
bogoso and prestea are adjoining mining concessions that together cover approximately kilometers of strike along the southwest trending ashanti gold district 
mining areas at bogoso and prestea are linked to the bogoso processing plants by paved and gravel haul roads located on our properties 
there are two ore processing facilities at bogoso prestea  and open pit mining methods are employed 
ore is hauled by truck from the pits to the processing plants 
equipment and facilities include a nominal million tonne per annum oxide ore processing plant  a nominal million tonne per annum sulfide ore processing plant  a fleet of haul trucks  loaders and mining support equipment 
in addition  there are numerous ancillary support facilities including warehouses  maintenance shops  roadways  administrative offices  an employee residential complex  power and water supply systems  a medical clinic  and a tailings disposal facility 
we acquired bogoso in and prestea in historical gold output at the bogoso processing plant has typically ranged between  and  ounces per year in recent years but increased to  ounces in following start up of the new bio oxidation sulfide plant in mid see the operating results for bogoso prestea section below for additional details on historical production and operating costs 
in addition to the two plants and mining complex at bogoso prestea  this property incorporates the pampe deposit which is located approximately kilometers west of the bogoso processing plants 
as at december  we have estimated a probable mineral reserve of million tonnes at an average gold grade of g t and we are mining at this property using open pit mining methods 
pampe ore is hauled by truck to the bogoso processing plants 

table of contents in addition to the bogoso prestea complex described above  bogoso prestea assets include the following non operating properties mampon the mampon deposit is located approximately kilometers north of the bogoso processing plant 
mampon is an undeveloped gold deposit with as at december   an estimated million tonnes of probable mineral reserves at an average gold grade of g t  which we plan to mine by open pit mining methods 
it is expected that mampon ore will be hauled by truck to the bogoso processing plants starting at some time after prestea south this property is discussed in more detail below under the development properties section 
prestea underground this property is discussed in more detail below under the exploration stage properties in ghana section 
geology at bogoso prestea bogoso prestea lies within the eburnean tectonic province in the west african precambrian shield along the ashanti trend located immediately south of the town of bogoso 
the area is dominated by a major northeast southwest trending structural fault zone referred to as the ashanti trend  which hosts the prestea  bogoso  obuasi and konongo gold deposits  among others 
parallel to the ashanti trend is the akropong trend  which hosts the ayanfuri deposit 
the akropong trend is about kilometers west of the ashanti trend in the bogoso region  and gradually converges with it at obuasi forming the basis for the obuasi mine  which is owned and operated by anglogold ashanti limited 
mineral reserves at bogoso prestea at december   bogoso prestea had proven and probable mineral reserves  including the probable mineral reserves at prestea south  mampon and pampe  of million tonnes grading g t containing approximately million ounces of gold before any reduction for recovery losses and the government of ghana s minority interest 
see the proven and probable mineral reserves table and the non reserves measured and indicated mineral resource table in item of this form k 
bogoso prestea s mineral reserves declined during from million ounces to million ounces primarily due to increases in operating costs during the year  especially in the cost of electric power 
lower gold recovery assumptions also contributed to the decrease in bogoso prestea s mineral reserves  as did mining depletion of ore during the year 
most of the ounces of gold removed from mineral reserves have now been reclassified as mineral resources 
future decreases in operating costs and or increases in gold prices could result in portions of these mineral resource being reclassified as mineral reserves 
operating results for bogoso prestea the following tables show historical operating results bogoso prestea non refractory ore non refractory ore processed t grade milled g t recovery bogoso prestea refractory ore refractory ore processed t grade milled g t recovery bogoso prestea total total gold sales oz cash operating costs oz gold sales are shown on a basis  which represents our current beneficial interest in gold production and revenues 
once all capital has been repaid  the government of ghana would receive of the dividends from the subsidiary owning bogoso prestea 
the bogoso prestea sulfide processing plant was placed in service in july exploration at bogoso prestea exploration efforts in concentrated on delineating and testing targets in an effort to provide additional feed for the bogoso processing plants 
we continued with the interpretation and interrogation of the time domain electro magnetic vtem airborne geophysical data 
ranking of targets has been initiated and is expected to be finalized in target ranking will be based on zones with favorable geology and structure coinciding with zones of high conductivity 
we expect this exercise to generate targets for drill testing over the next several years  commencing in 
table of contents bogoso prestea outlook for during we expect that the bogoso sulfide plant will continue to process refractory sulfide ores from the pits at bogoso prestea 
the oxide plant at bogoso and the pampe oxide mining operation is scheduled to remain on care and maintenance until late in  when we anticipate start up of oxide ore mining at prestea south  subject to receiving environmental permits 
once oxide ore mining begins at prestea south  mining is also expected to resume at pampe with ore from both properties being transported by truck to the bogoso oxide plant for processing 
we expect to eventually source additional oxide ore from the mampon deposit 
we expect bogoso prestea will produce approximately  ounces of gold in at an average cash operating cost of approximately per ounce 
the wassa gold mine overview of the wassa gold mine we own and operate the wassa gold mine located approximately kilometers east of bogoso prestea in southwest ghana 
the property was acquired in from a former owner who had operated the mine as a heap leach gold mine 
the property  as now constituted  includes a series of open pits  a nominal million tonne per annum cil processing plant with its crushing and grinding circuits  a fleet of mining equipment  ancillary facilities including an administration building  a warehouse  a maintenance shop  a stand by power generating facilities and an employee residential complex 
we completed construction of the cil processing plant in early  and the plant was placed in commercial service on april  in mid  ownership of the benso and hwini butre concessions was transferred from st 
jude resources to gswl 
in the third quarter of  following completion of a km haul road  we started mining at benso and began hauling its ore to wassa for processing 
in the fourth quarter of we began construction of a km haul road south to the hwini butre ore deposit and expect to begin mining there in the second half of ore grades at both benso and hwini butre are significantly higher than at wassa and are expected to contribute to increased gold output at wassa 
geology at wassa wassa lies within the eburnean tectonic province in the west african precambrian shield 
the proterozoic rocks that comprise most of the west african craton and host the major gold mineralization in ghana are subdivided into met sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the birimian and tarkwaian sequences 
wassa is hosted within the same birimian volcano sedimentary greenstone package as bogoso prestea 
however  wassa is situated on the southeastern flank of the ashanti belt while bogoso and prestea occur along the northwestern flank 
mineral reserves at wassa as at december   wassa  including the hbb properties  had proven and probable mineral reserves of million tonnes with an average grade of g t containing approximately million ounces of gold before recovery losses and any reduction for the government of ghana s minority interest 
see the proven and probable mineral reserves table and the non reserves measured and indicated mineral resource table in item of this form k 
while wassa s mineral reserves declined during  mostly due to mining depletion  this was partially offset by drilling at the hbb ore bodies which added  ounces 
operating results for wassa the following table displays historical operating results at wassa 
wassa operating results ore processed t grade milled g t recovery total gold production oz cash operating cost oz exploration at wassa exploration activities in the wassa area during concentrated on the wassa and benso mining leases  as well as chichiwelli 
at wassa and benso  development drilling targeted inferred mineral resources within optimized pit shells with the objective of converting these mineral resources to the indicated mineral resource category 
benso development drilling was conducted in two 
table of contents phases with the first phase being incorporated into an updated mineral resource estimate done mid year which was used for the year end mineral reserve and mineral resource statements 
further development drilling at the remaining wassa and hwini butre benso pits has been budgeted for the first half of drilling activities at chichiwelli continued during  and an initial mineral resource estimate has been completed 
the chichiwelli resource is located approximately km from the wassa plant  with the newly competed benso haul road passing within one kilometer of the areas drilled so far 
while exploration results to date have been encouraging  further development would require preparation of a feasibility study to fully evaluate the area s potential and to determine if transporting the material to the wassa plant for processing is economically viable 
wassa outlook for wassa is expected to process approximately  tonnes per day of hbb ore in  with the balance of the plant feed to come from the local wassa pits 
wassa hbb is expected to produce approximately  ounces in at an average cash operating cost of approximately per ounce 
development properties prestea south properties the prestea south project is located on the ashanti trend  southwest of the town of prestea and approximately km southeast of the bogoso processing plants 
gold mineralization is associated with the same ashanti trend fault structure that continues to the north through our bogoso and prestea properties 
while various sections of the mineral resources at prestea south were mined by prior owners using underground methods  the surface oxide mineral resources have not been extensively mined  and there are sulfide mineral resources accessible by open pit mining 
our exploration efforts in recent years have identified several deposits along this trend which can be mined by surface mining methods 
we received mining permits for this area in we have applied for environmental permits and expect to receive them during if the permits are approved in a timely basis following the hearing  prestea south development is expected to begin in with production anticipated to start in late the prestea south oxide ore will be transported to bogoso and processed through the bogoso oxide plant 
the prestea south sulfide ore will be processed through the bogoso sulfide plant 
as at december   the prestea south properties had a total probable mineral reserve of million tonnes grading g t containing approximately million ounces before any reduction for the government of ghana s minority interest 
there was an increase in illegal mining activity at the prestea south properties during  and the impact on mineral reserves is not known 
approximately of the mineral reserve is non refractory 
ore from the prestea south pits will be hauled by truck to the bogoso oxide processing plant along a km haul road 
hbb properties the hbb properties  which lie at the southeastern end of the ashanti trend in ghana  were acquired in december hwini butre is located approximately kilometers south of wassa and occupies an area of approximately square kilometers 
benso is located directly north of the hwini butre property and about kilometers south of wassa 
we currently hold a interest in the benso property through our subsidiaries and the government of ghana holds a carried interest 
the hbb properties lie along the southeastern flank of the birimian aged lower proterozoic ashanti belt  along the same structural trend as wassa 
the southwestern part of the hwini butre property covers a syn volcanic mafic intrusive that is bound to the east and north by the butre volcanic sequence 
the butre volcanic sequence  which also underlies the benso property further north  mostly comprises volcanic flows with minor meta sediment horizons 
the main regional structural orientation trends northeasterly and extensive north to northwest trending cross cutting fracture systems are also well developed 
the latter host much of the mineralization in the district 
mineralization on the hwini butre property is typically associated with shallow west dipping narrow quartz veins and their alteration halos  with coarse free gold associated with sulfides and within the quartz veins 
we initiated development of the benso mine in late during  the haul road was completed to wassa  a truck maintenance facility was completed  as was employee housing and offices 
we began mining and shipping benso ore to wassa at the end of the third quarter of  and a total of  tonnes of ore averaging g t was hauled from benso to the wassa plant by december  an extension of the haul road km south to the hwini butre pits was commenced in the fourth quarter of  and is expected to be commissioned during the second quarter of benso project capital expenditures totaled approximately million during  and we expect to spend approximately million on the hwini butre road and pit development in 
table of contents wassa plant throughput was lower in the fourth quarter of than in earlier periods  due to ball mill repairs and to the higher clay and moisture content of the initial ore from benso which required blending with fresh wassa ores 
no significant metallurgical difficulties were encountered with the benso ore  and predicted recoveries were achieved from the tonnages processed to date 
exploration stage properties in ghana prestea underground the prestea underground is an inactive underground gold mine located to the south of bogoso and adjacent to the town of prestea 
the property consists of two surface access shafts and extensive underground workings and support facilities 
access to the mine site is via a paved road from tarkwa and accra maintained by the government of ghana 
from the s to when mining ceased following an extended period of low gold prices  the prestea underground operations produced approximately nine million ounces of gold  the second highest production of any mine in ghana 
the underground workings are extensive  reaching depths of approximately  meters and extending along a strike length of approximately nine kilometers 
underground workings can currently be accessed via two surface shafts  one near the town of prestea central shaft and a second approximately four kilometers to the southwest at bondaye 
gsbpl now holds a ownership in the prestea underground with the government of ghana holding a ownership in prestea underground as well as its holding in gsbpl  resulting in an beneficial ownership by golden star 
exploration activities at the prestea underground in were limited to a surface infill drilling program targeting the plant north main reef footwall on meter drill spacing 
this drilling was completed early in  and our consultant completed a mineral resource update for this target 
upon completion of the drilling and remodeling of this target the prestea underground was put on care and maintenance 
a million impairment loss was recorded for this project at the end of see item management s discussion and analysis of operations below for additional discussion of the impairment 
geology of prestea underground the prestea underground deposits are located along the same ashanti trend structure as are our bogoso deposits a few kilometers to the north and our prestea south deposits a few kilometers to the south with most of the gold mineralization found in a narrow tabular fault zone which dips steeply to the northwest 
akropong trend properties the akropong properties are located along a fault structure which roughly parallels the ashanti trend and is located approximately km to the west of our bogoso processing plant 
our exploration continues to focus on smaller satellite deposits which can easily be trucked to bogoso for processing as we have been doing with material from pampe  located on the southern end of these properties 
we expect to drill several soil anomalies delineated in previous exploration programs at joset moseaso and afransi during dunkwa properties the dunkwa properties  which are located directly north of our bogoso mining lease consist of two prospecting licenses  mansiso and asikuma  the latter hosting our mampon ore deposit 
the mansiso and asikuma concessions were both flown as part of the vtem airborne geophysical survey and  as with bogoso and prestea  have been included in the interpretation and analysis of the vtem data 
the chargeability response from this survey has enhanced the understanding of the major structures running through the property and several new targets have been identified which we plan to follow up in other exploration stage properties in africa mano river joint venture  sierra leone in we concentrated our sierra leone exploration efforts on the sonfon prospect located in north central sierra leone 
we are earning into this joint venture property with mano river and expect to meet our expenditure requirements to hold a interest  as of the end of exploration activities during intersected zones of massive sulfides exhibiting good gold grades and follow up drilling on these zones is planned in cote d ivoire the exploration programs focused on our am likia  abengourou and agboville concessions located in the south eastern portion of cote d ivoire adjacent to the ghanaian border along northeast trending structures located to the west of the sefwi greenstone belt in ghana 
between and  we carried out a regional stream and laterite sampling program which identified two coincidental stream and laterite gold anomalies on the amelekia license 
these two zones cover an area approximately kilometers by and kilometers long 
in addition  a smaller kilometer by kilometer coincident laterite and stream anomaly was also outlined on the abengourou license area 
during we plan to follow up on these soil anomalies using tightly spaced soil sampling and prospecting with the aim to have drill targets for the first quarter of 
table of contents the afema project was returned to its owner in december following our conclusion that the project was not viable 
goulagou  burkina faso we hold a beneficial interest in the goulagou and adjoining rounga gold properties  which were acquired from st jude along with the hbb properties in late  with a local burkina faso partner owning a interest 
the government of burkina faso will receive a statutory carried interest upon the granting of a mining lease 
the two properties are located approximately kilometers west of ouagadougou  the capital city of burkina faso  and kilometers north of the city of ouahigouya 
drilling programs carried out by the prior owner and its predecessors identified several areas of gold mineralization including two parallel zones on the goulagou property the goulagou i and ii deposits 
in october  we granted riverstone resources inc riverstone an option to purchase the goulagou and rounga concessions 
exploration programs in were managed and implemented by riverstone and mainly consisted of infill reverse circulation drilling on the goulagou concession 
we expect that riverstone will continue its exploration efforts during in  an engineering analysis indicated that only  ounces of gold resources could be economically recovered 
a revised cash flow model based on  mineable ounces  showed that total free undiscounted cash flow is now nil and not the million originally expected 
based on this analysis the project has been written off and an impairment charge recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
deba and tialkam projects  niger the deba and tialkam gold properties in niger were acquired along with the hbb properties from st 
jude in late we hold a interest in the two exploration permits  subject to the interest of the government of niger 
soil sampling programs were carried out at both concessions in along with ground geophysics and  meters of drilling was done at tialkam 
licenses with respect to both concessions were renewed in  and we subsequently reapplied for portions of the properties surrendered  as required by niger mining law  when the permits expired earlier in the year 
exploration stage properties in south america saramacca property the saramacca property  located in suriname  consists of three concessions totaling square kilometers 
the area is underlain by lower proterozoic greenstone rocks of the paramaka and armina formations which also host iamgold s gross rosebel mine and newmont s nassau gold project 
since mid  the saramacca project has been operated as a joint venture between golden star and an exploration subsidiary of newmont 
the joint venture s exploration program focused on diamond core drilling on four separate anomalies including anomaly m  pompoekampoe and anomalies s and b 
an extensive regional geochemical soil grid sampling program was also carried out on the western portion of the concession where stream sampling had defined gold anomalies 
during  as in  newmont funded all of the exploration activities at saramacca with golden star personnel managing the project 
it is expected that newmont will take over active project management in once newmont s total spending reaches million 
newmont will at that time acquire in a ownership position 
typical dilution clauses apply if either party fails to contribute its portion of approved budgets subsequent to newmont acquiring its interest 
if either party s interest drops below  its ownership will convert to a net smelter royalty interest in the venture 
upon newmont completing a feasibility study  golden star may i elect to participate relative to its joint venture interest at that time  ii dilute its interest  or iii be assigned an automatic net smelter royalty interest in the venture 
if golden star elects to maintain its interest  it may elect to have newmont carry all golden star s share of mine development costs 
if this option is elected  golden star would repay newmont from of its share of eventual mine earnings plus interest at libor plus 
in addition  golden star would receive an advance royalty of per ounce of gold reported on the date that newmont approves development of a mine 
paul isnard the paul isnard project is located in the western part of french guiana  some km west of cayenne 
an option agreement between golden star and euro ressources sa euro and a subsidiary of euro provided golden star the right to acquire up to of the square kilometer property via a series of option payments and exploration spending 
as of the end of we had made all of the requisite option payments and had met our spending target 
arrangements were underway to seek transfer of ownership of the 
table of contents property to us in however  lawsuits between golden star resources ltd 
and euro involving disputes over ownership of the property under the option agreement  which are still pending  and iamgold s late acquisition of euro  have interrupted completion of the transfer process 
the paul isnard project area covers rocks of the lower proterozoic paramacca formation which contain gold mineralization in the form of pyritic disseminated zones or stringer zones and sulfide rich shear zones  which can be reasonably correlated between the current widely spaced meter drill sections from our late s drilling 
in february  as part of a feasibility study of paul isnard s montagne d or deposit  a ni preliminary assessment report was finalized by an external consultant 
the preliminary assessment concluded that further exploration work was required to increase the overall resources of the project before advancing to a pre feasibility assessment 
the results of the study estimated an inferred mineral resource of million tonnes grading g t  constrained within a per ounce gold price optimized pit shell 
in early additional geochemical studies and airborne geophysical surveys were completed  indicating extensions of the geophysical anomaly characterized at montagne d or to the west of the original geochemical anomaly and where most of the core drilling was done in the late s 
our exploration program was limited following the french government s decision to halt the authorization of the development of iamgold s camp ca man mining project in eastern french guiana pending the establishment of a new mining scheme for the entire country 
under the option agreement with euro  once we acquire the property  we have agreed to pay a royalty to euro on all future gold production  if any  from the paul isnard property up to million ounces 
the royalty varies from of the difference between the market price of gold and for gold sales up to million ounces  and five percent of the same for gold sales between million and million ounces

recent sale of unregistered securities no sales of unregistered securities occurred during certain canadian federal income tax considerations the following is a summary of the principal canadian federal income tax considerations that apply to the holding and disposition of our common shares 
this summary only applies to a holder who is for canadian income tax purposes not resident in canada  is resident in the united states of america under the provisions of the canada united states income tax convention the treaty and holds our common shares as capital property 
this summary is based on the current provisions of the income tax act canada and the regulations there under the tax act and all amendments to the tax act publicly proposed by the government of canada to the date hereof 
this summary is also based on the current provisions of the treaty and our understanding of the current publicly available administrative and assessing practices published in writing by the canada revenue agency 
it is assumed that each proposed amendment will be enacted as proposed and there is no other relevant change in any governing law  although no assurance can be given in these respects 
this summary does not otherwise take into account any change in law or administrative practice  whether by judicial  governmental  legislative or administrative action  nor does it take into account provincial  territorial or foreign income tax consequences  which may vary from the canadian federal income tax considerations described herein 
a particular us resident person may not be entitled to benefits under the treaty if the limitations of benefits provisions of the treaty apply to the particular us resident person 
the limitation of benefits provisions under the treaty are complex and us residents are advised to consult their own tax advisors in this regard 
under the treaty members of a limited liability corporation created under the limited liability company legislation in the us and treated as a partnership or disregarded entity under us tax law llc and holders of interests in similarly fiscally transparent us entities may be entitled to benefits under the treaty in certain circumstances provided that the members of the llc are taxed in the united states on any income  profits or gains earned through the llc in the same way they would be if they had earned it directly 
special rules  which are not discussed in this summary  may apply if you are an insurer carrying on business in canada and elsewhere  or a financial institution as defined by section of the tax act 
if you are in any doubt as to your tax position  you should consult with your tax advisor 
this summary is of a general nature only and it is not intended to be  nor should it be construed to be  legal or tax advice to any holder of the common shares and no representation with respect to canadian federal income tax consequences to any holder of common shares is made herein 
accordingly  shareholders should consult their own tax advisers as to the income and other tax consequences arising in their particular circumstances 
taxation of dividends dividends paid or credited or deemed to be paid or credited by us to a holder of one or more common shares will be subject to canadian non resident withholding tax at the rate of on the gross amount of the dividend 
under the treaty  the rate of withholding tax is reduced to if the holder is the beneficial owner of the dividends or if the holder is a company that owns at least of the company s voting stock and beneficially owns the dividend 
dividends paid to religious  scientific  charitable and similar tax exempt organizations and pension organizations that are resident and exempt from tax in the us and that have complied with the administrative procedures specified in the treaty are exempt from this canadian withholding tax 

table of contents taxation of capital gains gains realized by a holder on a sale  disposition or deemed disposition of our common shares will not be subject to tax under the tax act unless the common shares constitute taxable canadian property within the meaning of the tax act at the time of the sale  disposition or deemed disposition including a deemed disposition upon death of a holder 
our common shares are not taxable canadian property provided that they are listed on a designated stock exchange which includes the tsx  and that neither you  nor one or more persons with whom the you did not deal at arm s length  alone or together  at any time in the five years immediately preceding the disposition  owned or more of the issued shares of any class or series of our capital stock 
even if our common shares are taxable canadian property to you  under the treaty you will generally be exempt from paying canadian income tax on any gain provided that you are a resident of the united states for the purposes of the treaty and are otherwise eligible for the benefits of the treaty  and further provided that the value of our common share is not derived principally from real property situated in canada 
currently  our common shares do not derive their value principally from real property situated in canada and therefore capital gains realized from the disposition of our common shares would be exempt from tax by virtue of the provisions of the tax treaty  however  the determination as to whether canadian tax would be applicable on a sale  disposition or deemed disposition of common shares must be made at the time of that sale  disposition or deemed disposition 
certain united states federal income tax considerations there are certain us federal income tax risks associated with investments in golden star 
holders of our common shares  warrants or options to purchase our common shares  or convertible debentures collectively  equity securities who are us taxpayers should consider that we could be considered to be a passive foreign investment company pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
although we believe that we were not a pfic for  and do not expect to become a pfic in  the tests for determining pfic status depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  and can be subject to uncertainties  and we cannot assure you that we will not be a pfic 
we do not undertake any obligation to advise holders of our equity securities as to our pfic status for any year 
if we are a pfic for any year  any holder of our equity securities who is a us person for us income tax purposes a us holder and whose holding period for those equity securities includes any portion of a year in which we are a pfic generally would be subject to a special adverse tax regime in respect of excess distributions 
excess distributions include certain distributions received with respect to pfic shares in a taxable year 
gain recognized by a us holder on a sale or other transfer of our equity securities including certain transfers that would otherwise be tax free also would be treated as an excess distributions 
such excess distributions including gains treated as excess distributions would be allocated ratably to the us holder s holding period 
for these purposes  the holding period of common shares acquired through either an exercise of warrants or options or a conversion of debentures includes the holder s holding period in those warrants  options  or convertible debentures 
the current year s allocation would be includible as ordinary income in the current year 
prior year s allocations would be taxed at the highest marginal rate applicable to ordinary income for each such year regardless of the holder s actual marginal tax rate for the taxable year  and without reduction for any losses or carryforwards and would be subject to interest charges to reflect the value of the us income tax deferral 
elections may be available to mitigate the adverse tax rules that apply to pfics the so called qef and mark to market elections  but these elections may accelerate the recognition of taxable income and may result in the recognition of ordinary income 
we have not decided whether we would provide to us holders of our common shares annual information that would be necessary to make the qef election 
the qef and mark to market elections are not available to us holders with respect to warrants or options to acquire our common shares or with respect to convertible debentures 
additional special adverse rules also apply to investors who are us holders who own our common shares if we are a pfic and have a non us subsidiary that is also a pfic 
special adverse rules that could impact estate planning goals could apply to our equity securities if we are a pfic

w  nd floor  box  toronto dominion bank tower toronto dominion centre  toronto  on mk n our fiscal year ends on december we own controlling interests in several gold properties in southern ghana through a owned subsidiary  golden star bogoso prestea limited gsbpl  we own and operate the bogoso prestea gold mining and processing operations bogoso prestea located near the town of bogoso  ghana 
in july  we commissioned a nominal million tonnes per year processing facility at bogoso that uses bio oxidation technology to treat refractory sulfide ore 
in addition bogoso prestea has a carbon in leach processing facility which we expect to use to treat oxide ores as they are available 
bogoso prestea produced and sold  ounces of gold in and  ounces of gold in 
table of contents through another owned subsidiary  golden star wassa limited gswl  we own and operate the wassa open pit gold mine and carbon in leach processing plant wassa  located approximately kilometers east of bogoso prestea 
the design capacity of the carbon in leach processing plant at wassa is nominally million tonnes per annum but varies depending on the ratio of hard and soft ore 
wassa produced and sold  ounces of gold in and  ounces of gold in gswl also owns the hwini butre and benso concessions the hbb properties in southwest ghana 
we spent approximately million on the benso property during developing the benso mine which began shipping ore to wassa in the third quarter of an extension of the haul road from benso to hwini butre commenced in the fourth quarter of and is expected to be commissioned in the second quarter of the hwini butre and benso concessions are located approximately and kilometers  respectively  by road south of wassa 
we also hold interests in several gold exploration projects in ghana and elsewhere in west africa including sierra leone  burkina faso  niger and c te d ivoire  and hold and manage exploration properties in suriname  brazil and french guiana in south america 
all of our operations  with the exception of certain exploration projects  transact business in us dollars and keep financial records in us dollars 
our accounting records are kept in accordance with canadian gaap 
we are a reporting issuer or the equivalent in all provinces of canada and in the united states and file disclosure documents with the canadian securities regulatory authorities and the united states securities and exchange commission 
non gaap financial measures in this form k  we use the terms total operating cost per ounce  total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce 
total operating cost per ounce is equal to cost of sales for the period  as found in our statements of operations  after adjusting for inventory write offs and operations related foreign currency gains losses  divided by the ounces of gold sold in the period 
cost of sales include all mine site operating costs  including the costs of mining  processing  maintenance  work in process inventory changes including inventory write offs and adjustments  mine site overhead as well as production taxes  royalties  mine site depreciation  depletion  amortization  asset retirement obligation accretion and by product credits but does not include exploration costs  corporate office general and administrative expenses  impairment charges  corporate business development costs  gains and losses on asset sales  gains and losses on foreign currency conversions  interest expense  mark to market gains and losses on derivatives  gains and losses on investments and income tax 
total cash cost per ounce for a period is equal to total operating costs for the period  as found in the table below  less mining related depreciation and amortization and accretion of asset retirement obligations costs for the period  divided by the number of ounces of gold sold during the period 
cash operating cost per ounce for a period is equal to total cash costs for the period less production royalties and production taxes  divided by the number of ounces of gold sold during the period

table of contents total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce should be considered as non gaap financial measures as defined in sec regulation s k item and applicable canadian securities laws and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
there are material limitations associated with the use of such non gaap measures 
since these measures do not incorporate revenues  changes in working capital and non operating cash costs  they are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap 
changes in numerous factors including  but not limited to  mining rates  milling rates  gold grade  gold recovery  costs of labor  consumables and mine site general and administrative activities can cause these measures to increase or decrease 
we believe that these measures are the same as  or similar to  the measures of other gold mining companies  but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in every instance 
business strategy and development our business and development strategy has been focused primarily on the acquisition of producing and development stage gold properties in ghana and on the exploration  development and operation of these properties 
we acquired bogoso in and have operated a nominal million tonne per annum carbon in leach cil processing plant most of the time since then to process oxide and other non refractory ores bogoso oxide plant 
in  we acquired prestea and mined surface deposits at prestea from late to late in late  we acquired wassa  and constructed a new nominal million tonne per annum cil processing plant at wassa  which began commercial operation in april in july  we completed construction and development of a new nominal million tonnes per annum processing facility at bogoso prestea that uses bio oxidation technology to treat refractory sulfide ore bogoso sulfide plant 
in late  we acquired the hbb properties consisting of the benso and hwini butre properties 
development activities were initiated in late at benso  and in the third quarter of benso began trucking ore to the wassa plant for processing 
our overall objective is to grow our business to become a mid tier gold producer with an annualized production rate in excess of  ounces 
we continue to evaluate potential acquisition and merger opportunities that could further increase our annual gold production 
however  we presently have no agreement or understanding with respect to any specific potential transaction 
in addition to our gold mining and development activities  we actively explore for gold in west africa and south america  investing approximately million on such activities during and million in we are conducting regional reconnaissance projects in ghana  cote d ivoire and sierra leone and have drilled more advanced targets in ghana  niger and burkina faso 
we are also evaluating a property in french guiana and participating in a joint venture in suriname 
significant trends and events during bogoso prestea operations bogoso prestea produced and sold  ounces of gold during  up from  ounces in and  ounces in the improvements in gold output reflects a more stable and reliable operational status at the bogoso sulfide plant following resolution of various equipment issues  including replacement of almost of the bio oxidation tank agitators and gear boxes earlier in the bogoso oxide plant was idled during most of the third and fourth quarters of awaiting oxide ores from the prestea south development project which is now scheduled to start up in late benso development the benso mine development was substantially completed in the third quarter of  and production mining ramped up to an average of  tonnes per day during the fourth quarter of a total of  tonnes of ore averaging g t was hauled from benso to the wassa plant by december  it is expected that the deliveries of approximately  tonnes per day of higher grade benso ore to the wassa plant over the next several quarters will result in material improvements in wassa s operational and financial results 
change in bogoso prestea mineral reserves re estimation of mineral reserves at bogoso prestea at the end of resulted in a drop in ounces of reserves from the end of in addition to mining depletion during  a major factor contributing to the drop was the substantial increases in cash mining and processing costs during the costs of electric power  fuel and other operating consumables also increased substantially in furthermore  sulfide gold recovery rates were revised downward in the december  mineral reserve estimates to better reflect experience to date at the bogoso sulfide plant 

table of contents impairments in response to volatile gold prices and increases in operating costs during our assets were evaluated for impairment 
results of the analysis identified a number of impaired assets at the end of and the resulting write offs totaled million 
impaired assets included the prestea underground project  the goulagou exploration project and portions of the prestea south project and niger projects 
in addition  the transition ore stockpile at bogoso was written down by million to its net realizable value 
increases in cash operating costs  most notably electric power costs  and lower gold prices were the major contributing factors in the impairments and inventory adjustment 
pre feasibility study results obtained in mid further contributed to the prestea underground impairment 
energy prices in  the public utilities regulatory committee purc of ghana increased electric power rates for high voltage electric power customers effective july  the new rate in ghana cedis was equivalent to approximately per kilowatt hour  up from per kilowatt hour prior to the increase 
since the power rate is stated in ghana cedis  recent weakening of the ghana cedis has helped to alleviate a portion of this power price increase 
we  along with the other major gold producers in ghana  are working with the volta river authority vra  our power provider  to agree on a formula for future power prices that more closely reflects the actual cost of power generation for the vra 
during the fourth quarter of diesel fuel prices began to decline reflecting decreasing world crude oil prices 
fuel is one of our largest cost factors and the price drop  if continued  should have a beneficial impact on our unit costs 
gold prices gold prices have generally trended upward during the last seven years  from a low of per ounce in to a high of  per ounce in march since march  and especially after mid  gold price volatility increased with prices fluctuating in a wide band between and per ounce 
the realized gold price for our shipments averaged per ounce during  as compared to per ounce in prestea south we continue to seek the environmental permits which would allow surface mining at the prestea south gold deposits southeast of the town of prestea 
assuming timely receipt of the permits  we expect to begin developing the prestea south deposits in and plan to commence mining later in the year 
the prestea south oxide ore will be transported to bogoso where it will be processed through the bogoso oxide plant  and sulfide ores will be moved to bogoso and processed at the bogoso sulfide plant 
management changes in march  mr 
tom mair was appointed president and ceo and as a member of the board of directors 
mr 
mair previously served as interim president and ceo since january  and as senior vice president and chief financial officer from february to december in april  mr 
scott barr was appointed as executive vice president and chief operating officer 
mr 
john labate was appointed senior vice president and chief financial officer effective august  ghana stock exchange listing and share offering in february  our common shares were listed on the ghana stock exchange in accra to support the further growth of the ghana stock exchange and to allow our employees and stakeholders in ghana an opportunity to invest in golden star 
in conjunction with the listing  we completed an offering of  golden star common shares to investors in ghana and europe at a price of cedis per share 
all shares issued are tradable on the toronto stock exchange and the nyse alternext us stock exchange as well as on the ghana stock exchange 
illegal mining as with most gold mining operations in ghana  illegal mining is occurring on some of our properties  including prestea south and hwini butre 
we have brought this situation to the attention of the local and national governmental authorities 
while illegal mining has had minimal impact at our active mining operations so far  there is increasing amounts of illegal mining activity on our properties and it is occurring closer to our operating mines than in the past 
international financial reporting standards the canadian accounting standards board recently confirmed january  as the date international financial reporting standards ifrs will replace current canadian gaap for publicly traded companies in canada 
in response we are currently developing an ifrs change over plan 
towards this end we have retained a qualified consulting team to oversee and effect the conversion process 
it is expected that the plan will take into consideration  among other things identification of differences in canadian gaap and ifrs accounting policies and their impact on our consolidated financial statements  
table of contents selection of our continuing ifrs policies  changes in note disclosures  information technology and data system requirements  disclosure controls and procedures  including investor relations and external communications plans related to the ifrs conversion  identification of impacts of ifrs on internal controls over financial reporting  financial reporting expertise requirements  including training of personnel  and impacts on other business activities that may be influenced by gaap measures  such as debt covenants  it is not possible at this time to quantify the impact of these factors 
progress to date at december   the company has completed the planning phase of the project of the initial diagnostic between canadian gaap and ifrs 
while the effects of ifrs have not yet been fully determined  the company has identified a number of key areas where it is likely to be impacted by changes in accounting policy 
these include stock based compensation property  plant and equipment mine property and deferred exploration impairment of assets presentation of financial statements  including presentation of minority interests a detailed diagnostic is underway  and no decisions have yet been made with regard to accounting policy choices 
results of operations compared to consolidated results our consolidated net loss totaled million or per share for as compared to a net loss of million or per share in impairment losses  negative operating margins and an inventory adjustment were the major factors contributing to the increase in net loss as compared to prior years 
impairment write offs totaled million and included write offs of the prestea underground  the goulagou exploration project in burkina faso  a portion of the prestea south project at bogoso and the niger exploration projects 
our mine operating margin was a negative million  which included a million net realizable value adjustment which added million to mine operating costs 
increases in cash operating costs  most notably electric power costs and lower gold prices in the fourth quarter  were the major factors contributing to the impairments and inventory adjustment 
the results of a pre feasibility study of the prestea underground  completed in mid  further contributed to the prestea underground impairment 
while gold sales were  ounces above the level  and our average realized gold price was up per ounce  increases in operating costs more than offset the improved revenues yielding a mine operating margin loss approximately million larger than the operating margin loss 
the increase in revenues versus was related mostly to higher gold prices and to a full year of output at the bogoso sulfide plant in as compared to a half year in following its july plant in service date 
operating costs were significantly higher in as compared to recognition of a full year s operating costs at the bogoso sulfide plant in versus only six months of costs in was responsible for much of the operating cost increase 
at the same time  several of our key operating inputs at both mines experienced significant cost increases in electric power costs increased from per kilowatt hour in early to approximately per kilowatt hour in late and to approximately per kilowatt hour after june  similarly  fuel costs trended up during most of reaching a high of per liter by october 
our fuel costs averaged per liter in  up from per liter in several other key inputs saw similar significant increases during including labor costs 
summary of financial results gold sales oz average realized price oz revenues in thousands cash flow provided by operations in thousands net income loss in thousands net income loss per share basic general and administrative costs increased by million to million in the increase is primarily attributable to the cost of professional fees and severance costs related to management changes 
interest expense totaled million during  up from million in two factors contributed to the increase 
first was the fact that most of the interest expense in the first half of was capitalized as a cost of the bogoso sulfide plant prior to its july  in service date 
secondly during most of the interest expense was related to million of convertible notes which were repaid in november and replaced with million of convertible debentures 
a million loss on debt restructuring was incurred in november upon the redemption of the million of convertible notes 

table of contents in response to lower gold prices near the end of  several cost cutting measures were implemented company wide including reductions in the consumption rate of various key reagents and other items including labor force reductions 
at the same time commodity prices began falling  lowering costs for fuel and various chemical reagents 
as a result of our cost reduction programs and declining consumable prices  fourth quarter cash costs fell below levels experienced earlier in  and we expect this trend to continue into bogoso prestea operations compared to bogoso prestea gold shipments increased to  ounces in at an average price of per ounce  up from  ounces in at an average price of per ounce 
the large increase in bogoso prestea gold shipments reflects the fact that the shipments include a full year of sulfide plant output while the amount was for only six months of following the sulfide plant s july  in service date 
bogoso prestea operating results ore mined refractory t ore mined non refractory total ore mined t waste mined t refractory ore processed t refractory ore grade g t gold recovery refractory ore non refractory ore processed t non refractory ore grade g t gold recovery non refractory ore gold sales oz cash operating cost oz royalties oz total cash cost oz the increase in gold output at bogoso prestea also reflects improved operating availability at the sulfide plant following remediation of several mechanical problems encountered in late and the first half of  including replacement of most of the bio oxidation tank agitators and agitator gearboxes 
a more stable operation has now resulted in a pattern of increasing tonnes processed and an improvement in gold recoveries during  as evidenced by sulfide plant gold shipments of  ounces in the first quarter of   ounces in the second quarter   ounces in the third quarter and  in the fourth quarter 
gold recovery averaged in  up from in in the first half of the bogoso oxide plant demonstrated its flexibility by processing several ore types at various times including oxide ores  siliceous ores  refractory transition ores and refractory leachable transition ores 
however  the bogoso oxide plant was idled in august due to unavailability of oxide ore  and we expect it to remain on care and maintenance until late when we expect to begin mining oxide ores at prestea south and non refractory ores at pampe 
bogoso prestea operations resulted in a million operating margin loss  up from a million operating margin loss in bogoso prestea s cash operating costs rose to per ounce in  up from per ounce a year earlier 
increases in operating costs including labor  fuel  power and other consumables are responsible for the higher unit costs 
combined operating costs of the oxide and the sulfide operations totaled million in  as compared to million in the major factors contributing to the cost increase included a full year of operation at the sulfide plant in versus a half year in and a million adjustment to the transition ore stockpile at bogoso 
power  fuel  other consumables and labor costs were also up in the year 
electric power costs increased from per kilowatt hour in early to approximately per kilowatt hour in late and to approximately per kilowatt hour after june  similarly  fuel costs trended up during most of reaching a high of per liter by october 
our fuel costs averaged per liter in  up from an average of per liter in the transition stockpile contained partially oxidized ore mined from shallow depths in the sulfide pits 
partial oxidation results in low gold recovery 
when test batches of this ore were processed through both plants in  it was found that gold recoveries were lower than anticipated 
in addition  lower gold prices in the fourth quarter of and higher operating costs resulted in the need to adjust the stockpile s carrying value down to its net recoverable value resulting in million of inventory costs being moved into cost of sales 

table of contents the prestea underground mine was deemed impaired at the end of  and a million write off was recognized in the statement of operations 
completion of a pre feasibility study in mid on the prestea underground indicated that the economics of the project were marginal 
increases in electric power costs later in and the on going costs of maintaining the inactive underground mine further contributed to the impairment determination 
portions of the prestea south project near the town of prestea were also deemed impaired because the estimated cost of relocating homes and town site infrastructure negated the economic benefit of the reserves 
wassa operations compared to wassa generated million of operating margin in versus a million operating margin in while ore grades and gold prices were higher in than a year earlier  increases in operating costs during more than offset the price and grade benefit 
wassa operating results ore mined t waste mined t ore and heap leach materials processed t grade processed g t recovery gold sales oz cash operating cost oz royalties oz total cash cost oz wassa s results includes operation of the new benso mine starting in the th quarter of wassa s operating costs totaled million in  up from million in the cost increases reflect material increases in the costs of power  fuel  other consumables and labor 
wassa also saw an increase in costs once the new benso ore began arriving at wassa in the fourth quarter  due primarily to haulage costs from benso to wassa 
cash operating costs averaged per ounce in  up from per ounce in wassa s average realized gold price rose to per ounce in  up from per ounce in  and the average ore grade increased from g t in to g t in the grade improvement was related to receipt of  tonnes of benso ore in the fourth quarter of at an average grade of grams per tonne 
plant throughput was adversely impacted in september and october by ball mill repairs which reduced throughput to approximately half of usual capacity for eight weeks 
in addition plant throughput dropped in the fourth quarter when the benso ore began arriving 
shallow ore from the new benso pit is wetter and contains more clay than ore from the wassa pits and required a slower feed rate 
as mining proceeds at deeper levels in the benso pits  improvements in throughput are expected 
results of operations compared to consolidated results our consolidated net loss totaled million or per share for  as compared to net income of million or per share in the major factor contributing to the better results in was the sale of non core assets  including all of our moto goldmines limited shares and most of our euro shares 
a million pre tax gain was recognized in on the sale the moto shares and a million pre tax gain was recorded for the sale of million euro shares 
in comparison  during  sales of assets added only million to pre tax income 
mine operating margin losses totaled million in  down from a million positive operating margin in overall bogoso prestea s ounces sold and average gold prices increased over levels  but bogoso operating margins were adversely affected in the second half of the year when the new bogoso sulfide processing plant was placed in service 
the new plant s operating costs were recognized in the second half following its july in service date  but gold recovery difficulties resulted in lower than expected revenues which resulted in a negative operating margin 
increases in the costs of labor  reagents  fuel  power and depreciation in also contributed to the lower margin versus 
table of contents general and administrative costs increased by million to million in the increase is primarily attributable to additions to the management team in  legal fees on financing activities and stock based compensation expenses 
derivative losses decreased by to million in most of the derivative losses incurred during were related to gold hedges held by our former subsidiary  euro 
a million loss on debt restructuring was incurred in november upon the redemption of convertible notes with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the majority of the foreign exchange gains earned in are related to canadian dollar accounts that held the proceeds of a december equity offering 
much of the interest expense was capitalized into the bogoso sulfide processing plant construction costs 
following the end of construction in mid  interest expense was once again recognized in the period incurred 
bogoso prestea operations compared to bogoso prestea recorded an operating margin loss of million versus a positive operating margin of million in the bogoso prestea oxide processing plant s operations were adversely impacted by lower ore grades and insufficient oxide ore versus delays in obtaining permits for pampe resulted in processing of lower grade oxide ores from various small deposits in the bogoso area 
a day maintenance shut down in may also contributed to the lower gold output 
start up of the new bogoso sulfide processing plant was delayed until july  by plant equipment failures and design problems 
similar problems after start up contributed to plant throughput and gold recovery below design levels 
both plants were also adversely affected by country wide power shortages during the year and by increases in several categories of operating costs 
the total combined cash operating costs of the oxide and the sulfide operations totaled million in  as compared to million in the major factor contributing to the cost increase was recognition of the new sulfide operation costs after its july  in service date 
increases in labor  consumables and power costs at the oxide processing plant also contributed to the increase over the amounts 
cost increases included fuel costs which were up per liter from a year earlier 
the cost of cyanide increased per tonne and steel grinding balls were per tonne higher than a year earlier 
the higher operating costs and lower than expected production at the new sulfide operation  and lower ore grades and lower throughput at the bogoso oxide processing plant  combined to yield an average cash operating cost at bogoso prestea of per ounce  up from per ounce beginning in the fourth quarter of  in response to a shortfall of oxide ore from the new pampe pit  the bogoso oxide processing plant activated its flotation circuit and began processing sulfide ore with the sulfide flotation concentrate going to the new sulfide processing plant s bio oxidation circuit for further processing 
the switch to the harder sulfide ore reduced throughput 
the new bio oxidation circuit has sufficient excess capacity to accommodate all of the bogoso oxide processing plant s sulfide concentrate 
the bogoso oxide processing plant processed an average of  tonnes per day during this included  tonnes of oxide ores from january to october and  tonnes of sulfide ores from november to december  this compares to an average of  tonnes per day in the new bogoso sulfide processing plant operated throughout the second half of  but plant throughput and gold output were below design rates 
sulfide flotation recovery rates improved throughout the period but recovery was still below design rates 
the new sulfide plant processed an average of  tonnes of ore per day during the fourth quarter 
wassa operations compared to wassa generated a million positive operating margin in versus a million operating margin loss in two factors contributed to the performance improvement in addition to higher gold prices 
first  was a significant decrease in waste mining tonnage which resulted in lower overall mining costs 
secondly  the average ore grade increased from grams per tonnes in to grams per tonne in reduced waste mining requirements in freed up mining equipment to mine increased amounts of pit ore which resulted in the need for less of the low grade heap leach ore was required 
wassa also mined more tonnes from the new higher grade pits than in these improvements resulted in gold sales of  ounces in  up from  ounces in wassa s cash operating costs totaled million in  up from million in the increase was largely due to increases in the costs of labor  consumables and power 
cost increases versus a year earlier include fuel which was up per liter  cyanide which increased by percent per tonne and steel grinding balls which increased by per tonne 
power shortages during the year resulted in significantly higher power costs because self generated power costs were higher than the cost of power from the ghana grid 
even though cash costs were substantially higher in total  the increase in gold output more than compensated  yielding the operating cash costs of per ounce  down from per ounce in wassa processed an average of  tonnes per day during at an average grade of grams per tonne with a gold recovery of  versus  tonnes per day at an average grade of grams per tonne and a recovery rate of in 
table of contents depreciation was higher in than re estimation of wassa reserves at december  resulted in a decrease in reserves which resulted in higher units of production depreciation during the increase in gold output also resulted in higher depreciation costs 
development projects prestea south properties we applied for mining permits for this area and they were received in we have applied for environmental permits and expect to receive them during if the permits are approved in a timely basis  prestea south development is expected to begin in with production anticipated to start in late the prestea south oxide ore will be transported to bogoso and processed through the bogoso oxide plant 
the prestea south sulfide ore will be processed through the bogoso sulfide plant 
hbb properties development of the benso mine began in late and by third quarter the haul road was completed to wassa as was a truck maintenance facility  employee housing and offices 
a total of  tonnes of ore averaging g t was hauled from benso to the wassa plant by december  an extension of the haul road km south to the hwini butre pits was commenced in the fourth quarter of  and is expected to be commissioned in the second quarter of benso project capital expenditures totaled million during and we expect to spend approximately million on the hwini butre road and pit development in as expected  the higher clay and moisture content of the initial ore from benso necessitated blending with fresh wassa ores to achieve acceptable plant throughputs 
while no significant metallurgical difficulties were encountered and predicted recoveries were achieved from the volumes processed to date  wassa plant throughput was lower in the fourth quarter of than in earlier periods 
exploration projects during golden star spent million on exploration activities compared to million in the exploration effort concentrated on resource delineation drilling of underground targets beneath the plant north pit at prestea  on the chujah south pit at bogoso  on the wassa pits and benso pits and initial evaluation drilling of the manso  hwini butre  chichiwelli and mansiso targets 
other ghana exploration included soil auger sampling on several prospects on the western ashanti belt  prospects north of the wassa mining lease and targets located on the northern portion of the hwini butre mining lease 
analysis of data from the vtem geophysical survey conducted along the ashanti trend properties in at bogoso  prestea  pampe and dunkwa  was completed during  and interpretation  delineation and prioritization of drill targets commenced 
exploration drilling was also conducted on our sierra leone and niger projects 
our burkina faso properties were drilled by riverstone this year as part of an option agreement expenditure requirements on those properties 
in cote d ivoire soil sampling programs over the previously defined stream sediment anomalies at ameleka and abengorou were the main focus of our efforts 
our joint venture with newmont on the saramacca project in suriname continued in with newmont continuing to fund the work which involved diamond drilling and soil geochemistry programs 
our french guiana exploration efforts were limited in as we awaited the new mining legislation which is being revamped by the french government 
we formalized our exploration efforts in brazil in with the creation of a new subsidiary and the transfer of our existing licenses in mato grosso and minas gerais to this entity 
exploration plans we expect to spend approximately million on exploration activities in focusing mostly on resource definition drilling in and around our mining leases in ghana 
although our exploration budget is substantially less than in previous years  we expect to accomplish a significant amount of drilling in using our own drilling department and recently purchased drill rig 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  compared with million at the end of the million spent on capital development projects and new equipment during was largely responsible for the reduction in cash 
mining equipment and mine development costs at the new benso mine used million  deferred exploration projects used million and million was used for mining equipment and mine development at wassa and bogoso 
operating activities provided million of cash during  compared to million in changes in working capital items including increases in payables were the major factor contributing to the increase in cash provided by operating activities as compared to issuance of stock in conjunction with the ghana stock exchange listing in february netted million  and exercises of employee stock options provided million during the year 
we borrowed a total of million on the equipment financing facility during the year and repaid million 
we used million of our funds for scheduled repayments of the short term bank loan in ghana  leaving only million owing on this debt at december  
table of contents at december  the caterpillar equipment financial services facility  which has a limit of million  had a balance of million leaving available credit of million on the facility 
at the end of all of our cash equivalents were invested in a fund that held only us treasury notes and bonds 
liquidity outlook during world financial markets suffered a series of significant difficulties including financial institution failures  a decrease in liquidity  a decrease in world wide economic activity and unprecedented volatility in the cost of operating consumables and commodity prices including gold 
while gold prices declined for a brief period early in the fourth quarter of  gold prices have since risen to levels at or above those of the first nine months of also in the fourth quarter  the costs of many of our operating consumables began trending lower which has since lead to lower operating costs 
in response to the lower gold prices early in the fourth quarter we implemented a cost reduction program throughout the company and also deferred or cancelled certain capital projects 
based on the trends described above  start up of our new higher grade benso mine  continuing improvements in gold output at the bogoso sulfide plant  our cash flow projections and the fact that most of our long term liabilities are not due until  we expect that operational cash flows during  along with the million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at december  and the equipment financing facility currently in place  are expected to be sufficient to cover capital and operating needs during the next months 
during we expect that the significantly higher grade ores trucked to wassa from benso and hwini butre will have a positive impact on wassa s operating cash flows which are expected to exceed prior year levels 
if the bogoso sulfide plant continues to respond to our efforts to increase gold output during as it did in  bogoso s contribution to operating cash flows should also increase  and additional cash flow is expected from bogoso prestea once the prestea south oxide ore becomes available for processing at the bogoso oxide plant 
our expected capital budget is substantially lower than in recent years at million  down from million spent in the budget includes million for hwini butre development  million for additional sulfide pit development at bogoso  million for deferred exploration and mine site drilling and million of sustaining capital mostly at bogoso and wassa 
during  we expect to make payments of principal and interest of approximately million on the equipment financing facility in addition to the one final million payment made on the short term bank loan in january interest payments on the convertible debentures are expected to total million in looking ahead our objectives for include continue optimizing the bogoso sulfide processing plant to improve recoveries  availability and reduce costs  construction and development of the hwini butre portion of the hbb project  with first ore scheduled to be delivered to wassa in the second half of  permitting and development of prestea south ore bodies in to provide oxide ore for the bogoso oxide processing plant  continued exploration drilling at bogoso prestea  wassa and the hbb properties to further evaluate their resource potential 
we are estimating bogoso prestea gold production of  ounces at an average cash operating cost of per ounce 
we expect wassa to also produce approximately  ounces during at an average cash operating cost of per ounce  with consolidated total production of approximately  ounces at an average cash operating cost of approximately per ounce 
as more fully disclosed in the risk factors in item a of this form k  numerous factors could cause our estimates and expectations to be wrong or could lead to changes in our plans 
under any of these circumstances  the estimates described above could change materially 
related party transactions during we obtained legal services from a legal firm to which our chairman is of counsel

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements reflect the application of cdn gaap  which is different in certain material respects from us gaap 
the accounting policies reflected therein are generally those applied by similarly situated mining companies in canada 
our accounting policies under cdn gaap are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that can affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
accounting policies relating to asset impairments  depreciation and amortization of mining property  plant and equipment  tax assets and site reclamation closure accruals are subject to estimates and assumptions regarding reserves  gold recoveries  future gold prices  future operating and reclamation costs and future mining activities 
decisions to write off  or not to write off  all or a portion of our investment in various properties  especially exploration properties subject to impairment analysis  are based on our judgment as to the actual value of the properties and are therefore subjective in most cases 
certain exploration properties have been found to be impaired in the past and were written off in  and we continue to retain title to certain properties after impairment write offs as future events and discoveries may ultimately prove that they have value 
listed below are the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are critical to our financial statements based on the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset  liability  revenue or expense being reported 
ore stockpiles stockpiles represent coarse ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing 
stockpiles are measured by physical surveying or by estimating the number of tonnes of ore added and removed from the stockpile during a period 
the number of contained ounces is based on sample assay data and the estimated gold recovery percentage is based on the expected processing method 
stockpile values are based on mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore  including a share of direct overhead and applicable depreciation  depletion and amortization relating to mining operations 
costs are added to a stockpile based on current mining costs and are removed at the average mining cost per tonne for material processed 
stockpiles are reduced as material is removed and fed to the mill 
a adjustment of the stockpile value  based on stockpile levels at the end of  would change the carrying value of the stockpile inventory by approximately million 
impairment charges we periodically review and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable from continued operation of the asset 
an asset impairment is considered to exist if the sum of all estimated future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  are less than the carrying value of the long lived asset 
the determination of expected future cash flows requires numerous estimates about the future  including gold prices  operating costs  gold recovery  reclamation spending  ore reserves and capital expenditures 
mining properties mining properties and certain property plant and equipment items recorded in our financial records are amortized using a units of production method over proven and probable mineral reserves 
reserve estimates  which serve as the denominator in units of production amortization calculations  involve the exercise of subjective judgment and are based on numerous assumptions about future operating costs  future gold prices  continuity of mineralization  future gold recovery rates  spatial configuration of gold deposits  and other factors that may prove to be incorrect 
a adjustment in estimated total reserves at wassa and at bogoso prestea could result in an approximately to million annual change in amortization expense 
tax assets recognition of future tax assets requires an analysis of future taxable income expectations to evaluate the probability of sufficient future taxable income to utilize the accrued tax benefits 
determination of expected future taxable income requires numerous estimates of future variable including but not limited to  gold prices  operating costs  gold recovery  ore reserves  gold production  ore grades  administrative costs  tax rates  and potential changes in tax laws 
asset retirement obligation and reclamation expenditures accounting for reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates at each mining operation of reclamation and closure costs to be incurred in the future as required to complete the reclamation and environmental remediation work mandated by existing laws  regulations and customs 
actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated 
additionally  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required 
based upon our current situation  we estimate that a increases in total future reclamation and closure costs would result in an approximately million increase in our asset retirement obligations 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements changes in accounting policies during effective january   we adopted the following accounting standards updates issued by the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica 
these new standards have been adopted on a prospective basis with no restatement to prior period financial statements 
a capital disclosures section this standard requires disclosure of an entity s objectives  policies and processes for managing capital  quantitative data about what the entity regards as capital and whether the entity has complied with any capital requirements and  if it has not complied  the consequences of such noncompliance 
b inventories section this standard replaces the existing section with the same title and harmonizes accounting for inventories under canadian gaap with ifrs 
this standard requires that inventories be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value  and includes guidance on the determination of cost  including allocation of overheads and other costs 
the standard also requires that similar inventories within a consolidated group be measured using the same method of either first in  first out fifo or weighted average cost formula to measure the cost of other inventories 
it also requires the reversal of previous write downs to net realizable value when there is a subsequent increase in the value of inventories 
the adoption of this statement resulted in the reclassification of million and million from inventory to property  plant and equipment at december   and december   respectively 
c going concern amendments to section cica  general standards of financial statement presentation  was amended to include requirements to assess and disclose an entity s ability to continue as a going concern 
the new requirements were effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after january  the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
d financial instruments disclosure section and presentation section these standards replace cica  financial instruments disclosure and presentation 
they increase the disclosures currently required  which will enable users to evaluate the significance of financial instruments for an entity s financial position and performance  including disclosures about fair value 
in addition  disclosure is required of qualitative and quantitative information about exposure to risks arising from financial instruments  including specified minimum disclosures about credit risk  liquidity risk and market risk 
the quantitative disclosures must provide information about the extent to which the entity is exposed to risk  based on information provided internally to the entity s key management personnel 
recent accounting pronouncements section replaces cica and establishes standards for the recognition  measurement and disclosure of goodwill and intangible assets 
the provisions relating to the definition and initial recognition of intangible assets are equivalent to the corresponding provisions of ias  intangible assets 
cica financial statement concepts is amended to clarify criteria for recognition of an asset 
cica research and development costs is replaced by guidance in cica eic is no longer applicable for entities that have adopted cica a number of other eic abstracts have consequential amendments 
acg enterprises in the development stage is also amended to delete references to deferred costs and to provide guidance on development costs as intangible assets under cica these changes are effective for the company commencing january  off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk includes  but is not limited to  the following risks changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio and debt  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity price fluctuations and equity price risk 
interest rate risk our excess cash is typically invested in high quality short term debt instruments 
the interest rates received on such investments fluctuate with changes in economic conditions 
as a result  our investment income may fall short of expectations during periods of lower interest rates 
we estimate that  given the cash balances expected during  a change in interest rates would not materially impact our annual income 
we do not utilize interest rate sensitive derivatives to mitigate interest rate risk 
we have not entered into any agreements to hedge against unfavorable changes in interest rates  but may in the future actively manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk while our major operating units transact most of their business in us dollars  certain purchases of labor  operating supplies and capital assets are denominated in euros  british pounds  australian dollars  south african rand and ghanaian cedi 
as a result  currency exchange fluctuations have in the past and may continue in the future to impact the costs of goods and services purchased in currencies other than the us dollar 
the appreciation of non us dollar currencies against the us dollar increases the costs of goods and services purchased in non us dollar terms  which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows 
conversely  a depreciation of non us dollar currencies against the us dollar usually decreases the costs of goods and services purchased in us dollar terms 
during the second half of  strengthening of the us dollar resulted in million of currency gains mostly related to purchases of operating and capital items in ghana where the ghana cedi has weakened against the us dollar 
in general  the value of cash and cash equivalent investments denominated in foreign currencies fluctuates with changes in currency exchange rates 
appreciation of non us dollar currencies results in a foreign currency gain on such investments and a decrease in non us dollar currencies results in a loss 
we held minimal balances in foreign currency accounts during and thus there were no material gains or losses from this source 
at december   we held no foreign currency purchase agreements and do not anticipate using foreign currency purchase agreements on a regular basis 

table of contents commodity price risk gold is our primary product and  as a result  changes in the price of gold could significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows 
according to current estimates  a per ounce change in our average realized price of gold for would result in a to million change in pre tax earnings and cash flows 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we entered into a series of gold forward price contracts in response to a significant increase in gold price volatility 
we entered forward contracts covering  ounces or approximately half of our expected fourth quarter gold production in the fourth quarter at an average price of per ounce 
late in the fourth quarter we entered into forward sales agreements covering a total of  ounces which expire ratably on a weekly basis throughout the first quarter of at an average price of per ounce 
our operating costs are exposed to fluctuations in the price of crude oil in world markets  prolonged increases in the price of crude oil will result in an increase the fuel cost to operate our equipment  an increase in the cost to import goods and services  and also an increase in our power cost 
conversely a decrease in the price of crude oil will result in a decrease in the aforementioned costs 
equity price risk we have in the past and may in the future seek to acquire additional funding by sale of common shares 
movements in the price of our common shares have been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future 
as a result  there is a risk that we may not be able to sell new common shares at an acceptable price should the need for new equity funding arise
