business highlights during  we made significant progress in various areas of our business 
we grew our product sales significantly  executed on product approvals and product launches in multiple territories  made progress on moving our product candidates forward and continued to strengthen our worldwide organization and infrastructure to support our expanded international footprint and business activities 
our commercial achievements for the year included the continued rollout of atripla in the european union eu  driving growth of atripla and truvada in the united states and canada  launching viread for hepatitis b in the eu and the united states  making gains in the pah market with letairis  as well as continuing the expansion of our sales and marketing infrastructure  including the establishment of new international marketing subsidiaries 
during the year  we received marketing authorization for viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b in adults in all member states of the european union  turkey  new zealand  australia  the united states and canada 
along with the marketing approvals we received in  we made significant advances on the compounds and product candidates in our research and development r d pipeline  including in the hiv area  we received positive feedback from the us food and drug administration fda during the latter part of the year  regarding our development plans for elvitegravir  our novel integrase inhibitor for hiv which we licensed from japan tobacco inc in  gs  our pharmacoenhancer that is in development as a boosting agent for certain hiv medicines  and our single 
table of contents tablet fixed dose regimen of elvitegravir  gs and truvada 
the fda agreed with our proposal to simultaneously develop these three product candidates  allowing us to eventually support three separate new drug application nda filings with four phase clinical studies one study for elvitegravir  two studies for the single tablet fixed dose regimen mentioned above  and one study for gs as a result of this proposal  we will be combining the second of our two previously planned phase studies for elvitegravir with the first phase elvitegravir study which we began dosing in the third quarter of in hepatitis c  we completed dosing of patients in the continuation of the phase b study of gs  a non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor  and began enrolling the phase study in patients infected with the hepatitis c virus 
during the year  we completed our phase a study of gs  the caspase inhibitor we licensed from lg life sciences in  and expect to initiate the phase b study in the second quarter of to evaluate the longer term safety and efficacy of gs we are enrolling patients with nonalcoholic steadohepatitis in a phase a study of gs to evaluate its safety and effect on liver enzymes and anticipate having data from this study before the end of in the cardiovascular area  we completed enrollment of one of our two phase studies for darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension and we anticipate having data from this study in the second quarter of we continued to enroll patients in our second phase study for darusentan  and we anticipate completing the enrollment before the end of with data available in early we are developing cicletanine for pah and expect to initiate a phase clinical trial examining both once daily and twice daily dosing in early we are also preparing to initiate a phase study of ambrisentan in patients with pulmonary hypertension in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in the second quarter of in the respiratory area  we submitted an nda for aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of cystic fibrosis cf to the fda in november in september  we received a complete response letter from the fda informing us that the fda will not approve our nda for aztreonam for inhalation for the treatment of cf and requesting an additional phase clinical study 
in november  we filed a request for a formal dispute resolution with the fda 
in february  in response to our appeal  the fda notified us that it is reiterating its position that we will need to conduct another clinical study of aztreonam for inhalation solution before we can resubmit our nda 
we have also submitted a marketing authorization application maa in the eu and received notice of acceptance and priority review by health canada for approval in canada 
we are still awaiting responses from the respective regulatory bodies 
also in the respiratory area  we began enrolling patients with non cf bronchietasis in a phase study evaluating aztreonam for inhalation solution for this indication  we initiated a phase study in the fourth quarter of to evaluate the safety and tolerability of gs  a novel epithelial sodium channel blocker designed to increase airway hydration for the treatment of pulmonary disease  and in the fourth quarter of  we also initiated a phase study evaluating the safety and efficacy of gs  an inhaled co formulation of fosfomycin and tobramycin  for bacterial infections associated with cf 
financial highlights our operating results for the year were led by total product sales of billion 
antiviral product sales truvada  atripla  viread  hepsera and emtriva increased to billion in from billion in  and were the key drivers for total product sales growth of for as compared to with the continued uptake of atripla in the united states and product launches in europe  atripla contributed billion  or  to our total antiviral product sales 
the growth of atripla product sales and its increased proportion to overall product sales caused total product gross margin to decrease as expected to in from in  due primarily to the efavirenz component of atripla sales at zero gross margin 
truvada product sales for comprised billion  or of our total antiviral product sales 
truvada product sales for increased from primarily due to continued sales volume growth as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange impact 
foreign currency fluctuations in had a favorable impact of approximately million on total revenues and million on pre tax income when compared to 
table of contents royalty revenues that we recognized from our collaborations with corporate partners were million in  a decrease of from royalty revenues of million in the decrease in royalty revenues was due primarily to decreased tamiflu sales by roche related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide 
operating expenses which include r d  selling  general and administrative sg a and purchased in process research and development ipr d expenses increased million in  or  compared to  reflecting the increased research and clinical study activity in our development pipeline  our expanded commercial activities worldwide  as well as the higher headcount  infrastructure and technology related costs required to support the continued growth of our business 
in  we continued to be very focused on cost control and operating margins and will continue to do so in our operating margin is impacted by the efavirenz component of a growing atripla revenue stream and a declining trend for tamiflu royalties 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by million during the year  driven primarily by our operating cash flows of billion 
our strong cash position allowed us to complete two accelerated share repurchase transactions as well as make significant common stock repurchases from the open market under the billion stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors board in october  which expires in december during  we repurchased a total of billion under our stock repurchase program  or approximately million shares 
as of december   the remaining authorized amount of stock repurchases that may be made under the board authorized stock repurchase program was million 
in light of the volatility and developments in the financial markets  we continued to review our cash equivalents and marketable securities carefully as well as invest prudently in safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk  as well as liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements  continued to be of primary importance to our investment goals 
this approach helped protect us from the significant risks in the credit markets in while allowing us to meet our operating cash flow requirements and execute on other opportunities such as our share repurchases 
outlook we anticipate that the high level of productivity and financial performance experienced in will continue in our operating objectives include the expansion of our commercial markets  both from a franchise perspective as well as leveraging the new international marketing subsidiaries that we have established in the last two years  reaching our significant r d development timelines  continuing to strengthen our pipeline with internally developed and or externally in licensed or purchased opportunities and strengthening our key alliances 
from a commercial standpoint  a number of internal and external initiatives may help promote the continued growth of our franchises 
in the hiv area  we should be favorably impacted by the presentation of important data sets at upcoming medical conferences  continued testing and screening initiatives  and recent changes in hiv treatment guidelines 
in the area of hepatitis b  a broad platform of educational activities concentrated in asian american communities  highlighting the need to screen  diagnose and link patients to care  will help support viread for hbv 
in the united states  since the launch of viread for hbv in august  our hepatitis sales and medical affairs teams have concentrated their efforts solely on promotion of viread 
in the cardiovascular area  we will continue to build our presence within the pah community and to support the growth of letairis in we are mindful that conditions in our current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals 
some of the factors that could affect our business include the volatility in foreign currency exchange rates  government pricing pressures in both the united states and internationally  as well as changes in the financial health and or practices of our significant business partners and customers 
although we have not yet seen significant changes  we will continue to monitor the credit and foreign currency exchange markets  
table of contents developments in health care reform and legislation as well as the practices of our suppliers  manufacturers  corporate partners and customers  and will adjust our business processes as needed to mitigate these risks to our business 
the successes we experienced in have helped us maintain and build a financially sound business model that we believe will allow us to continue to expand our commercial  collaborative and r d activities  and maintain the infrastructure to ensure quality and compliance in all areas of our business 
as we continue to grow our business and achieve greater operational leverage  we remain focused on profitable revenue growth and prudent expense management that we believe will enable solid execution of our operating objectives for critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  prepaid royalties  clinical trial accruals  our tax provision and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  however  may differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition product sales we recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery to the customer has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as medicaid reimbursements  customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment  distributor fees and expected returns of expired products 
these estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized 
of these reductions from gross product sales  government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment by management 
government rebates we estimate amounts payable by us to government managed medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal  state and foreign government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs 
government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
for qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price  the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower price  which we record as allowances against accounts receivable 
although we may pay rebates in countries outside of the united states  to date  payments made to foreign governments have not represented a significant portion of our total government rebates 
for government programs in the united states  we estimate these sales allowances based on contractual terms  historical utilization rates  new information regarding changes in these programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates  our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and  for us product sales  channel inventory data obtained from our major us wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements 
during  and  u 
s government rebates 
table of contents of million  million and million  respectively  representing  and of total gross product sales  respectively  were deducted from gross product sales 
based on the current information available to us  actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by less than from our estimates recorded in those periods 
as of december  and  we had accrued us government rebates of million and million  respectively  in other accrued liabilities and an allowance of million and million  respectively  recorded against accounts receivable 
the following table summarizes the aggregate activity in our us government rebates allowance and accrued liabilities accounts balance at beginning of year charged to expense deducted from accruals balance at end of year year ended december  government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities activity related to sales activity related to sales prior to total year ended december  government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities activity related to sales activity related to sales prior to total allowance for doubtful accounts we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including  but not limited to  contractual payment terms  historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances  an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices 
if the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from december  to december  we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions  however  significant deterioration in any of the above factors  especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the european market could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
prepaid royalties we capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost  specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to emory university emory for the hiv indication  based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to emory assuming certain expected future levels of our product sales incorporating emtricitabine 
the present value of our future royalty obligation was derived using our weighted average cost of capital 
we review quarterly the expected future sales levels of our products and any indicators that might require a write down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the estimated life of the prepaid royalty 
some potential indicators of impairment include the launch of a significant product by a competitor  significant deviations in recognized product sales compared to forecast and product safety issues and recalls 

table of contents we amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted hiv product sales incorporating emtricitabine 
our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products  the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans 
if a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts  including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors in the same hiv market as emtricitabine  we will prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future royalty expense 
as of december   we had a prepaid royalty asset relating to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to emory of million 
amortization expense relating to this prepaid royalty asset was million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
clinical trial accruals we record accruals for estimated clinical study costs 
most of our clinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations cros 
these costs are a significant component of r d expenses 
during  and  we incurred cro costs of million  million and million  respectively 
we accrue costs for clinical studies performed by cros on a straight line basis over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates  if required  based upon our ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the cros 
we validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts 
based upon the results of these validation processes  we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the cros 
generally  a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs is associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment 
we extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start up activities in house 
as a result  cros typically perform most of the total start up activities for our trials  including document preparation  site identification  screening and preparation  pre study visits  training and program management 
start up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event driven in nature 
the remaining clinical activities and related costs  such as patient monitoring and administration  generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study 
most contracts are negotiated as fixed per unit prices and can vary in length between three months for a single dose phase clinical study and up to two years or more for a more complex phase clinical study 
the average length of contracts in  and has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of truvada  atripla  viread  hepsera  emtriva and letairis 
all of our material cro contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the cro and certain non cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination 
amounts paid in advance relating to uncompleted services will be refunded to us if a contract is terminated 
some contracts may include additional termination payments that become due and payable if we terminate the contract 
such additional termination payments are only recorded if it becomes probable that a contract will be terminated 
through december   differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study have not been material 
however  if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or underestimates activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time  we may have to record additional and potentially significant r d expenses in future periods 
tax provision we estimate our income tax provision  including deferred tax assets and liabilities  based on significant management judgment 
we evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 

table of contents if we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance  we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made 
such an adjustment was made in and when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets would be realized  and therefore  we released the related valuation allowance 
this resulted in a credit to goodwill of approximately million for and an income tax benefit of approximately million and million for and  respectively 
our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws  regulations or rates  changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations  the impact of accounting for stock based compensation  changes in our international organization and changes in overall levels of income before tax 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  on january   we adopted fin and increased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits by million with a corresponding charge to the opening balance of accumulated deficit  as permitted under fin in addition  we reclassified million of unrecognized tax benefits from short term income taxes payable and noncurrent deferred tax assets to long term income taxes payable 
as of the date of adoption  we had total federal  state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of million recorded primarily in long term income taxes payable on our consolidated balance sheet  including accrued liabilities related to interest of million 
of the total unrecognized tax benefits  million  if recognized  would have reduced our effective tax rate in the period of recognition 
as permitted under the provisions of fin  we have continued to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations 
at december  and  we had total federal  state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of million and million  respectively  including interest of million and million  respectively 
of the total unrecognized tax benefits at december  and  million and million  respectively  if recognized  would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition 
during  we reached agreement with the internal revenue service irs on several issues related to the examinations of our federal income tax returns for and as a result  we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by million 
as of december   we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately million in the next months as we expect to have clarification from the irs around certain of our uncertain tax positions 
with respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits  we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
we file federal  state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the united states and abroad 
for us federal and california income tax purposes  the statute of limitations remains open for all years from inception due to our utilization of net operating losses related to prior years 
our income tax returns are audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we are currently under examination by the irs for the and tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions 
there are 
table of contents differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations  and as a result  significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions 
we record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions based upon fin we do not believe any of the currently pending items will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements  although an adverse resolution of several or more of these items in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 
prior to the adoption of fin  we recorded liabilities related to uncertain tax positions based upon sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires that all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of stock options  be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
on january   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method of adoption as permitted under sfas r  which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all nonvested stock options and other stock based awards as of the beginning of the first quarter of adoption 
in connection with our adoption of sfas r  we refined our valuation assumptions and the methodologies used to derive those assumptions  however  we elected to continue using the black scholes option valuation model 
the fair value of stock options granted prior to the adoption of sfas r was calculated using the multiple option approach while the fair value of stock options granted beginning january  was calculated using the single option approach 
concurrent with our adoption of sfas r  we determined that a blend of historical volatility along with implied volatility for traded options on our stock would be a better measure of market conditions and expected volatility 
previously  we used historical stock price volatility as it was the most reliable source of volatility data 
we estimate the weighted average expected term of our stock options based on historical cancellation and exercise data related to our stock options as well as the contractual term and vesting terms of the awards 
we record stock based compensation expense using a graded vesting expense attribution approach for nonvested stock options granted prior to the adoption of sfas r consistent with the expense attribution approach used for our historical sfas disclosures and use a straight line expense attribution approach for stock options granted after the adoption of sfas r 
we currently believe that the straight line expense attribution approach better reflects the level of service to be provided by our employees over the vesting period of our awards 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options is recognized net of estimated forfeitures 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience 
as a result of the adoption of sfas r  we will only recognize a tax benefit from stock based compensation in additional paid in capital apic if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized 
in addition  we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through the consolidated statements of operations rather than through apic 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized stock based compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively  in operating expenses  and we capitalized million  million and million  respectively  to inventory 
as of december   we had unrecognized stock based compensation of million related to nonvested stock options  which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted average period of years 
our management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to these critical accounting policies 

table of contents results of operations total revenues we had total revenues of billion in  billion in and billion in included in total revenues were product sales  royalty revenues and contract and other revenues 
product sales product sales for the last three years consisted of the following in thousands change change antiviral products truvada atripla viread hepsera emtriva total antiviral products ambisome letairis other total product sales total product sales increased by in compared to  due primarily to an overall increase in our antiviral product sales including the strong growth of atripla sales as well as the continued growth of truvada sales 
foreign currency denominated product sales experienced a net benefit from the depreciation of the us dollar of approximately million for compared to total product sales increased by in compared to  due primarily to an increase in our total product sales volume of billion and a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of million 
a significant percentage of our product sales continued to be denominated in foreign currencies 
we used foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales  primarily those denominated in euro 
this reduced  but did not eliminate  fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as seen by the net benefit mentioned above 
antiviral products antiviral product sales in increased by compared to and by in compared to  driven primarily by sales volume growth of atripla and truvada  as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange impact 
truvada truvada sales increased by in compared to driven primarily by sales volume growth in the united states and europe  and a favorable foreign currency exchange impact 
truvada sales increased by in compared to driven primarily by strong sales volume growth in europe as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange environment in truvada sales accounted for  and of our total antiviral product sales for  and  respectively 
atripla atripla sales increased by in compared to  driven primarily by the continued uptake of atripla in the united states  as well as launches of the product in most european countries 
atripla sales increased in compared to  due primarily to the first full year of atripla sales in 
table of contents as atripla was launched in the united states in july as well as the continued strong uptake of atripla in the united states 
we consolidate of atripla product sales because we are the primary beneficiary of our joint venture with bristol myers squibb company bms in the united states 
outside of the united states  we also recognize of atripla product sales 
the efavirenz portion of our atripla sales was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
atripla sales accounted for  and of our total antiviral product sales for  and  respectively 
sales of atripla in the european union were not significant in as atripla was approved for sale in the european union in december other antiviral products other antiviral product sales  which include product sales of viread  hepsera and emtriva  increased by in compared to driven primarily by a increase in hepsera sales which benefited from a favorable foreign currency impact as well as sales volume growth in certain european countries 
other antiviral product sales decreased by in compared to driven primarily by an and decrease in the sales of viread and emtriva  respectively  due to the impact of patients switching from viread and emtriva containing regimens to regimens containing truvada and or atripla in countries where these combination products were available  partially offset by a increase in hepsera sales due primarily to sales volume growth across all major geographical regions and a favorable foreign currency exchange environment 
ambisome sales of ambisome increased in compared to  due primarily to a favorable foreign currency exchange impact and sales volume growth in certain european markets 
sales of ambisome increased in compared to  due primarily to sales volume growth in europe as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange impact 
ambisome product sales in the united states relate solely to our sales of ambisome to astellas pharma inc which are recorded at our manufacturing cost 
letairis sales of letairis for the treatment of pah increased in compared to  driven primarily by sales volume growth in the united states as letairis was launched in june we expect total product sales to continue to grow in as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts 
royalty revenues the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues in thousands change change royalty revenues our most significant source of royalty revenues for  and was from sales of tamiflu by f 
hoffmann la roche ltd together with hoffmann la roche inc  roche 
royalty revenues for were million  a decrease of compared to  driven primarily by the recognition of tamiflu royalties from roche of million in compared to tamiflu royalties from roche of million in the lower tamiflu royalties for was due primarily to decreased roche sales related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide 
royalty revenues for were million  an increase of compared to  driven primarily by the recognition of higher tamiflu royalties from roche in  compared to million recorded in the higher tamiflu royalties for were due to the 
table of contents higher tamiflu sales recorded by roche  including sales related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide during we recognize royalties on tamiflu sales by roche in the quarter following the quarter in which tamiflu is sold 
cost of goods sold and product gross margin the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales in thousands  cost of goods sold in thousands and product gross margin change change total product sales cost of goods sold product gross margin our product gross margin for was compared to for and for the decreases in product gross margin are due primarily to the growing proportion of atripla sales  which include the efavirenz portion at zero product gross margin and the impact of changes in the product and geographic mix of our product sales 
a higher mix of atripla product sales decreases our overall product gross margin 
although we record of atripla product sales  we only benefit from the product gross margin on the truvada portion of atripla sales 
the efavirenz portion of atripla sales carries a zero product gross profit and gross margin since we purchase efavirenz from bms at bms s net selling price of efavirenz 
we expect our product gross margin in to be lower compared to  due primarily to higher expected atripla sales 
research and development expenses the following table summarizes the period over period changes in the major components of our r d expenses in thousands change change research clinical development pharmaceutical development total research and development r d expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including salaries  benefits and stock based compensation  clinical studies performed by cros  materials and supplies  license fees and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs 
our r d activities are separated into three main categories research  clinical development and pharmaceutical development 
research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology costs 
clinical development costs include costs for phase   and clinical trials 
pharmaceutical development expenses consist of costs for product formulation and chemical analysis 
r d expenses in increased by million or  compared to  due primarily to increased clinical study expenses of million primarily in the antiviral and cardiovascular areas  as well as increased compensation and benefit expenses of million due primarily to higher headcount 
r d expenses in increased by million or  compared to  due primarily to increased compensation and benefit expenses of million due largely to higher headcount  increased clinical study 
table of contents expenses of million and increased contract service expenses of million relating to clinical  product development and research activities in our cardiovascular programs 
in addition  we paid a million up front license fee to lg life sciences  ltd 
lgls and a million license related fee to pari gmbh pari in  both of which we expensed as there were no future alternative uses for these technologies 
in general  significant collaboration payments  like those made to lgls and pari  will cause our r d expenses to fluctuate period over period 
in  we expect r d expenses to increase over levels due to increased spending on our internal and collaborative r d efforts as we anticipate progressing our product candidates into more advanced clinical studies as well as adding more clinical development programs to our pipeline 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our sg a expenses over the last three years in thousands change change selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for increased by million or  compared to  due primarily to increased compensation and benefit expenses of million due largely to higher headcount  increased marketing and promotional expenses of million to support our expanded commercial operations  increased consulting and support services expenses of million related to the growth in our business  costs of million associated with certain employee termination related disputes in our international operations as well as increased infrastructure and technology expenses of million 
the increase in compared to was partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense of million due primarily to the higher expense associated with unvested stock options that we had assumed from myogen  including accelerated stock based compensation expenses related to certain myogen employee terminations during sg a expenses for increased by million or  compared to the increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits expenses of million due largely to higher headcount  as well as an increase in marketing and promotional expenses of million in the antiviral and cardiovascular areas  including those related to our launch of letairis for the treatment of pah

we believe that our organizational and geographic expansion activities will provide the appropriate infrastructure to support our business in purchased in process research and development expenses in connection with our acquisitions of myogen inc myogen and corus pharma  inc corus in  we recorded purchased ipr d expenses of billion and million  respectively  during the year ended december  
table of contents the purchased ipr d expense for myogen represented the estimated fair value of myogen s incomplete r d programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses as of the acquisition date and  therefore  was expensed upon acquisition

phase clinical trials were completed prior to the acquisition date 
we filed an nda with the fda in december and  in june  the fda approved letairis for the treatment of pah in the united states 
additionally  in march  the european medicines agency emea validated the marketing authorization application for ambrisentan for the treatment of pah  filed by our collaboration partner  gsk

we estimated the fair value of the purchased ipr d using a present value discount rate of  which is based on the estimated internal rate of return for myogen s operations  is comparable to the estimated weighted average cost of capital for companies with myogen s profile  and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the purchased ipr d 
we compensated for the differing phases of development of ambrisentan and darusentan by probability adjusting our estimation of the expected future cash flows associated with each program 
we then determined at that time the present value of the expected future cash flows using the discount rate of 
the projected cash flows from the ambrisentan and darusentan programs were based on key assumptions such as estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the programs considering their stages of development  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the related product candidates  the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks  including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound such as obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets 
for the purpose of estimating the fair value of the ambrisentan program  we estimated that the program was approximately complete as of the acquisition date  based on estimated time and cost to complete  as phase clinical trials had been completed 
as of the acquisition date  we estimated that we would incur future r d costs of approximately million to million from the date of acquisition through and including the year when commercialization was expected to occur

the remaining efforts for completing the darusentan ipr d program consist primarily of clinical trials  the cost  length and success of which are extremely difficult to predict  and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
numerous risks and uncertainties exist that could prevent completion of development  including the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials and the risk of failing to obtain fda and other regulatory body approvals 
feedback from regulatory authorities or results from clinical trials might require modifications to or delays in later stage clinical trials or additional trials to be performed 
we cannot be certain that darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension will be approved in the united states or in countries outside of the united states or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use 
future discussions with regulatory agencies will determine the amount of data needed and timelines for review  which may differ materially from current projections 
darusentan may never be successfully commercialized 
as a result  we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of darusentan if  for example  we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline 
if this program cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all  then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted 
no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the above cash flows or the timely and successful completion of this project will materialize as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary significantly from estimated results

in november  we filed a request for a formal dispute resolution with the fda 
in february  in response to our appeal  the fda notified us that it is reiterating its position that we will need to conduct another clinical study of aztreonam for inhalation solution before we can resubmit our nda

in october  our board authorized a program for the repurchase of our common stock in an aggregate amount of up to billion through open market and private block transactions pursuant to rule b plans  privately negotiated purchases or other means 
this stock repurchase program expires in december under this stock repurchase program  in we repurchased shares in the open market and also entered into two structured accelerated share repurchase transactions with third parties which are described below 
in february  we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution to repurchase million of our common stock on an accelerated basis 
under the terms of this accelerated share repurchase agreement with the financial institution  we paid million to the financial institution to settle the initial purchase transaction and received  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
in june  upon maturity of the agreement and in accordance with the share delivery provisions of the agreement  we received an additional  shares of our common stock based on the average of the daily volume weighted average prices of our common stock during a specified period less a predetermined discount per share

as of december   we had a million letter of credit outstanding under the amended and restated credit agreement 
we believe that our existing capital resources  supplemented by cash generated from our operations  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the following the commercial performance of our current and future products  the progress and scope of our r d efforts  including preclinical studies and clinical trials  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities  administrative expenses  the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities  the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products  the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies  and costs associated with the defense  settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations

the amounts related to active pharmaceutical ingredients only represent minimum purchase requirements 
actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and have not been included in the table above 
at december   we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases 
our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to cros 
although most of our contracts with cros are cancelable  we generally have not cancelled such contracts 
these amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to  or termination of  existing contracts and anticipated or potential new contracts 
we had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of million as of december  we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately million in the next months as we expect to have clarification from the irs around certain of our uncertain tax

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf 
eitf provides guidance on how to determine if certain instruments or embedded features are considered indexed to our own stock  including instruments similar to our notes  convertible note hedges  warrants to purchase our stock and the forward contract that we entered into as part of our accelerated share repurchase transaction in february and which was completed in june and the forward contract that we entered into as part of our accelerated share repurchase transaction in october eitf requires companies to use a two step approach to evaluate an instrument s contingent exercise provisions and settlement provisions in determining whether the instrument is considered to be indexed to its own stock and exempt from the application of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
although eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   any outstanding instrument at the date of adoption will require a retrospective application of the accounting through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb 
fsp apb addresses instruments commonly referred to as instrument c from eitf  which requires the issuer to settle the principal amount in cash and the conversion spread in cash or net shares at the issuer s option 
fsp apb requires that issuers of these instruments account for their liability and equity components separately by bifurcating the conversion option from the debt instrument  classifying the conversion option in equity and then accreting the resulting discount on the debt as additional interest expense over the expected life of the debt 
fsp apb is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years  and requires retrospective application to all periods presented 
early application is not permitted 
we expect that the adoption of fsp apb will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
based on the requirements of fsp apb  we estimate that if fsp apb was effective for the current and comparative periods  we would have reported additional interest expense related to our notes of approximately million  million and million during  and  respectively

sfas also establishes additional reporting requirements that identify and distinguish between the ownership interest of the parent and the interest of the noncontrolling owners 
sfas is effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after december  upon adopting sfas  we plan to reclassify the noncontrolling interest  or minority interest  on our consolidated balance sheets from liabilities to stockholders equity and to present the noncontrolling interest  or minority interest  on our consolidated statements of operations as net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest  which will be a component of total consolidated net income loss

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the united states  canada and ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the united states  including europe and australia 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products 
our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  the most significant of which is the euro 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases 
conversely  when the us dollar weakens against these currencies  the relative amounts of such sales increase 
overall  we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 
a significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
we enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts and foreign currency exchange option contracts to partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales 
we also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid 
in general  the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged 
in recent years  foreign currency exchange fluctuations have primarily had a positive impact to product sales and gross margin  however  the full impact of the foreign currency fluctuations have been moderated by our hedging program

as of december   we held approximately million of auction rate securities within our available for sale long term marketable securities whose underlying assets were comprised of student loans 
our auction rate securities comprised approximately of our total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  most of our auction rate securities  including those subject to the failed auctions  are currently rated aaa  consistent with the high quality rating required by our investment policy 
if auctions continue to fail for securities in which we have invested  we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auction rate securities at par  should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities 
however  we believe that  based on our total cash and marketable securities position  our expected operating cash flows as well as access to funds through our credit facility  we are able to hold these securities until there is a recovery in the auction market  which may be at final maturity 
as a result  we do not anticipate that the current illiquidity of these auction rate securities will have a material effect on our cash requirements or working capital 
in light of the volatility and developments that we have seen in the financial markets  we continued to review our cash equivalents and marketable securities carefully as well as invest prudently in we believe that maintaining the primary goals of our investment policy  safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk  as well as liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements  has protected us from much of the risks in the credit markets while allowing us to continue to meet our operating cash flow requirements as well as execute on other opportunities such as our million and million accelerated share repurchases 
our accounts receivable balance at december  was billion  compared to million at december  the growth in our accounts receivable balances was due primarily to higher product sales of our antiviral products in the united states and europe 
our european product sales to government owned or supported customers in greece  italy  portugal and spain are subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices 
this has resulted and may continue to result in an increase in days sales outstanding due to the average length of time that we have accounts receivable outstanding 
this  in turn  may increase the credit risk related to certain of our customers 
sales to customers in these countries in europe that tend to pay relatively slowly have increased  and may continue to further increase  the average length of time that we have accounts receivable outstanding 
at december   our accounts receivable for greece  italy  portugal and spain totaled million  of which million was more than days past due 
to 
table of contents date  we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable  and we believe that substantially all of our accounts receivable balances are collectible 
we perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally have not required collateral
