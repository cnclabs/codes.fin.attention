table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are one of the nation s leading manufacturers and marketers of factory built homes 
we market nationwide through vertically integrated operations  encompassing manufactured and modular housing  financing and insurance 
as of march   we operated nine manufacturing facilities that sell homes through company owned retail sales centers and builder locations and approximately independent retail dealers  builders and developers 
through our subsidiary  countryplace  we currently offer conforming mortgages to purchasers of factory built homes sold by company owned retail sales centers and certain independent retail dealers  builders and developers 
the loans originated through countryplace are either held for our own investment portfolio or sold to investors 
we also provide property and casualty insurance for owners of manufactured homes through our subsidiary  standard casualty 
our results for fiscal were heavily influenced by the severe state of the factory built housing industry  the weakness in the overall housing market and the prevailing economic uncertainties and credit crisis 
there was a drastic slowdown in demand for factory built housing products and decline in retail traffic during fiscal industry shipments for calendar year through november were down approximately from the prior year s already historically low levels 
the three significant to both us and the industry manufactured housing states of florida  california and arizona were down a combined 
consumer concerns about the economy and the lack of available credit are keeping potential homebuyers on the sidelines  therefore affecting the demand for factory built housing 
while we expect these conditions to worsen and expect our performance to improve in fiscal  we are likely to still incur a net loss 
with the decline in retail demand  we have focused on new areas of business  including commercial and military projects  which present new revenue opportunities for us 
these institutions are looking for a quality provider and we are well positioned as a preferred supplier to meet this demand 
during fiscal  we produced barracks and other housing for three military bases 
in light of the current economic crisis and with no near term signs of recovery for the factory built housing industry  our top priorities are cash generation and cash preservation in every area of our business 
during fiscal  we focused on these priorities through the following we sold million of countryplace s warehoused portfolio of chattel and mortgage loans for a gain of million 
we used the proceeds to repay in full and terminate the warehouse borrowing facility scheduled to expire on april  through countryplace  we obtained a million construction lending line to use for financing mortgage loans 
we completed two sale leaseback transactions totaling million in cash for of our retail properties 
we retired million of our convertible senior notes for million of cash  resulting in a gain of million and lower interest costs 
we closed three less than efficient manufacturing facilities and one retail sales center 
we reduced inventories by million and receivables by million 
we have continued to reduce our overhead costs and employed other cash management steps 
we accomplished all the above and still funded million in committed pipeline loans from working capital when our warehouse lender exited the business 
we have been working with a financial advisor to leverage million of our unlevered assets 

table of contents for the near term  the outlook for housing  both site built and factory built  remains extremely challenging 
a number of issues must be resolved for any recovery to gain traction  and until inventories decline  housing prices stabilize  credit is restored and general economic fundamentals improve  we do not expect any short term improvement 
in the meantime  our strategy is to manage our operations more efficiently and become a stronger and leaner company 
accordingly  we remain focused on three critical areas in our business for fiscal our top priority is to manage our cash and leverage our balance sheet to maintain adequate liquidity through this uncertain business climate 
we are also streamlining our operations to reduce both marginal costs and selling  general and administrative expenses  consistent with expected revenues 
and finally  we continue to look for new sources of revenue by pursuing our creative efforts like flexible products  commercial and military modular products  and targeted internet marketing strategies 
regardless of market conditions  we will continue to leverage our core strengths the most trusted brand name in the industry  a diverse and high quality product line  manufacturing excellence and exceptional customer service 
during the third quarter of fiscal  our floor plan lender  textron financial corporation textron  announced that they are in the process of an orderly liquidation of certain commercial loan business including their housing finance business 
as further discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  in april  we agreed to an amendment to our floor plan facility which includes a lower total commitment amount from million to million  a new expiration date of march   new interest rates and new financial covenants 
in addition  as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  we agreed to a further amendment dated june   which extends the expiration date to june   among other things 
we were in compliance with our new financial covenants as of march  in addition  management believes that new quarterly financial covenants covering maximum net loss before taxes levels  annualized inventory turn and maximum borrowing base  all as defined in the recent amendments  for fiscal are achievable based upon our fiscal operating plan 
management has also identified other actions within their control that could be implemented  as necessary  to help us meet these quarterly requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful 
additionally  in light of market conditions  it is possible that we may be unable to comply with the new financial covenants during fiscal textron could also declare a loan violation due to a material adverse change  as defined in the agreement 
as a result  if a loan violation were to occur and not be remedied in accordance with the terms of the floor plan facility  textron could declare an event of default and demand that the full amount of the facility be paid in full prior to maturity 
such a demand would result in  among other things  a cross default of our convertible senior notes described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
while we are currently exploring asset sales and other types of capital raising alternatives in order to generate liquidity  there can be no assurance that such activities will be successful or generate cash resources adequate to fully retire the textron floor plan facility at maturity 
in this event  there can be no assurance that textron will consent to a further amendment of the floor plan facility agreement 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the items in our statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended march  march  march  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses goodwill impairment loss from operations interest expense gain on repurchase of convertible senior notes equity in loss of limited partnership and impairment charges other income loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense net loss the following table summarizes certain key sales statistics as of and for the period indicated

net sales decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of a million decrease in factory built housing net sales and a million decrease in financial services net revenues 
the decline in factory built housing net sales is primarily due to a decrease in the total number of factory built homes sold coupled with decreases in the average selling prices of new modular and manufactured homes 
the decrease in the total number of factory built homes sold reflects the severe state of the factory built housing industry  the prevailing economic uncertainties  credit crisis and general consumer paralysis that has kept potential homebuyers on the sidelines 
also  we were operating fewer retail stores and four less factories than last year 
homes sold to independent dealers  builders and developers decreased in fiscal largely due to slowdowns in sales to lifestyle communities in the three key states of florida  california and arizona  which historically were some of our most profitable states 
the reduction in independent sales was bolstered by million in commercial and military modular sales 
the 
table of contents decrease in the average selling prices is the result of our lower priced products 
the decrease in financial services net revenues reflects a decline in the average consumer loans balance from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  resulting from the sale of approximately million of loans in april gross profit 
in fiscal  gross profit decreased to of net sales  or million  from of net sales  or million in fiscal gross profit for the factory built housing segment decreased to of net sales in fiscal from in fiscal the decline in factory built housing margin is primarily the result of increased manufacturing costs driven by rapidly rising material costs 
this decline is partially offset by an increase in margin resulting from the impact of the restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal to close under performing sales centers and three less than efficient plants coupled with an increase in the internalization rate the percentage of factory built homes we manufactured and sold through our company owned retail stores and builder locations from in fiscal to in fiscal gross profit for the financial services segment decreased million in fiscal due to decreased net revenues as explained above in the net sales section 
however  the financial services segment produced gross profit of million in fiscal and positively contributed to our cash flow

in dollars  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal of this million decrease  million related to the factory built housing segment  million related to the financial services segment and million related to general corporate expenses 
the majority of the reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses related to the factory built housing segment and general corporate expenses resulted from the restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal to close under performing sales centers and three less than efficient plants  plus a reduction in performance based compensation expense 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for the financial services segment relates to a million one time performance based compensation payment in fiscal the payment was based on countryplace profitability from inception through goodwill impairment 
goodwill impairment was million for fiscal due to the difficult market environment and our operating losses  we determined that an interim test to assess the recoverability of goodwill was necessary 
with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis and concluded that the goodwill relating to our factory built housing reporting unit was impaired 
as a result  during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million to fully impair the goodwill related to our factory built housing segment 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal of this decrease  million related to decreased interest expense on the average balance of the warehouse facility which was terminated april  and million related to decreased interest expense on the average balance of the securitized loans resulting from reduced securitization financing balances in fiscal as compared to fiscal gain on repurchase of convertible senior notes 
during fiscal  we repurchased million of our convertible senior notes for million in cash  resulting in a gain of million 
other income 
other income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to a million decrease in interest and dividend income resulting from reduced rates of return coupled with lower average cash and cash equivalent balances 
this is offset by a million increase on income earned on a real estate investment 
income tax benefit expense 
income tax benefit was  in fiscal as compared to expense of million in fiscal the million of income tax expense for fiscal related to our recording a valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing the tax benefits associated with these assets 

table of contents compared to net sales 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of a million decrease in factory built housing net sales offset by a million increase in financial services net revenues 
the decline in factory built housing net sales is primarily due to a decrease in the total number of factory built homes sold and decreases in the average retail and wholesale selling prices of new manufactured homes offset by an increase in the average retail selling price of a new modular home 
the decrease in the total number of factory built homes sold is largely due to a decrease in the homes sold to independent dealers  builders and developers  the majority of which related to shipments to the states of florida  california and arizona  which prior to were typically some of our most profitable states see executive overview section above for more details 
these states have been especially impacted by decreased manufactured home sales to manufactured housing retirement communities 
the decrease in the average retail and wholesale selling prices of new manufactured homes is the result of our new lower priced products 
the increase in the average selling prices of a new modular home is the result of customers purchasing larger modular homes 
the increase in financial services net revenues primarily reflects an increase in interest income resulting from an increase in consumer loans receivable as of march  as compared march  gross profit

factory built housing expenses include million in charges related to closing under performing sales centers and less than efficient plants in fiscal and million in restructuring charges related to closing sales centers and plants in fiscal excluding these charges  selling  general and administrative expenses for the factory built housing segment decreased million 
this decrease is largely the result of the cost savings steps we put in place during fiscal plus a reduction in performance based compensation costs and operating fewer manufacturing facilities and sales centers 
selling  general and administrative expenses related to the financial services segment increased in fiscal due to a million one time performance based compensation payment 
the payment was based on countryplace profitability from inception through goodwill impairment 
goodwill impairment was million for fiscal due to the difficult market environment  particularly the recent fallout in the sub prime market  and our recent losses  we determined that an interim test to assess the recoverability of goodwill was necessary 
with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis and concluded that the goodwill relating to our factory built housing reporting unit was impaired 
as a result  during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to our factory built housing segment goodwill balance

the interest rate on the warehouse revolving debt and the floor plan payable is variable 
equity in loss of limited partnership and impairment charges

income tax benefit expense

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million at march   down from million at march  net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal as compared to net cash used of million in fiscal the cash provided by operating activities in fiscal is primarily attributable to the proceeds from the sale of consumer loans and principal payments on consumer loans originated 
also  the amount of net cash used for consumer loans has decreased as a result of countryplace not accepting applications for chattel loans and non conforming mortgages 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal as compared to net cash net cash used of million in fiscal this increase in cash provided by investing activities is primarily due to an increase in net cash received from divesting available for sale securities as well as a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures

we have an agreement with textron for a floor plan facility 
during the third quarter of fiscal  textron announced that they are in the process of an orderly liquidation of certain of their commercial finance businesses  including their housing inventory finance business 
on april  with an effective date of january   we agreed to an amendment which includes the following modifications a new committed amount of million reduced from million which will gradually be reduced to million by december   a new facility expiration date of march   a new interest rate of libor plus  and new financial 
table of contents covenants 
the new financial covenants we had to comply with as of march  were a maximum quarterly net loss before taxes of million  a minimum inventory turn of  and a maximum borrowing base requirement of of eligible finished goods inventory 
for the remaining quarters of fiscal  the aggregate maximum net loss before taxes covenant requirement is reduced to million 
the facility has an advance rate of of manufacturer s invoice and is principally secured by new home inventory and a portion of receivables from financial institutions 
as of march  and march   we had million and million  respectively  outstanding under the floor plan credit facility 
we agreed to a further amendment dated june   which includes the following extends the expiration date to june   lowers the committed amount from million to million and further lowers it to million upon the earlier of the sale of certain assets or december   alters the maximum quarterly net loss before taxes covenant to exclude any interest expense reflected on the financial statements due to accounting changes  and requires a prepayment of principal equal to any amounts of cash and cash equivalents greater than million as of march  no later than the earlier of business days after the closing of our fiscal quarter ending march  or april  we were in compliance with our new financial covenants as of march  in addition  management believes that new quarterly financial covenants covering maximum net loss before taxes levels  annualized inventory turn and maximum borrowing base  all as defined in the recent amendments  for fiscal are achievable based upon our fiscal operating plan 
management has also identified other actions within their control that could be implemented  as necessary  to help us meet these quarterly requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful 
additionally  in light of market conditions  it is possible that we may be unable to comply with the new financial covenants during fiscal textron could also declare a loan violation due to a material adverse change  as defined in the agreement 
as a result  if a loan violation were to occur and not be remedied in accordance with the terms of the floor plan facility  textron could declare an event of default and demand that the full amount of the facility be paid in full prior to maturity 
such a demand would result in  among other things  a cross default of our convertible senior notes described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
while we are currently exploring asset sales and other types of capital raising alternatives in order to generate liquidity  there can be no assurance that such activities will be successful or generate cash resources adequate to fully retire the textron floor plan facility at maturity 
in this event  there can be no assurance that textron will consent to a further amendment of the floor plan facility agreement 
in fiscal  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes in a private  unregistered offering 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in may and november 
the notes are senior  unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future unsecured and senior indebtedness 
the note holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash on may   may  and may  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
each  in principal amount of the notes is convertible  at the option of the holder  at a conversion price of  or shares of our common stock upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and contingencies 
for fiscal years  and  the effect of converting the senior notes to million  million and million shares of common stock  respectively  was anti dilutive  and  therefore  was not considered in determining diluted earnings per share 
during fiscal  we repurchased million of the notes for million in cash  resulting in a gain of million 

table of contents on july   we  through countryplace  completed our initial securitization for approximately million of loans  which was funded by issuing bonds totaling approximately million 
the bonds were issued in four different classes class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  and class a totaling million with a coupon rate of 
maturity of the bonds is at varying dates beginning in through and were issued with an expected weighted average maturity of years 
the proceeds from the securitization were used to repay approximately million of borrowings on our warehouse revolving debt with the remaining proceeds being used for general corporate purposes  including future origination of new loans 
for accounting purposes  this transaction was structured as a securitized borrowing 
on march   we  through countryplace  completed our second securitization for approximately million of loans  which was funded by issuing bonds totaling approximately million 
the bonds were issued in four classes class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  and class a totaling million with a coupon rate of 
maturity of the bonds is at varying dates beginning in through and were issued with an expected weighted average maturity of years 
the proceeds from the securitization were used to repay approximately million of borrowings on our warehouse revolving debt with the remaining proceeds being used for general corporate purposes  including future origination of new loans 
for accounting purposes  this transaction was also structured as a securitized borrowing 
countryplace s obligation under this securitized financing is guaranteed by us 
upon completion of the securitization  countryplace extinguished its interest rate swap agreement on its variable rate debt which was used to hedge against an increase in variable interest rates 
upon extinguishment of the hedge  countryplace recorded a loss of million  net of tax  for the change in fair value to other comprehensive income loss  which is amortized to interest expense over the life of the loans 
countryplace had an agreement with a financial institution for a million warehouse borrowing facility to fund loans originated by countryplace 
on april   countryplace sold approximately million of its warehoused portfolio of chattel and mortgage loans 
approximately million of the proceeds were used to repay in full and terminate the warehouse borrowing facility scheduled to expire on april  in january  countryplace obtained a million construction lending line to use for financing mortgage loans during the construction period 
there is no expiration period for the agreement  but countryplace is obligated to repurchase individual loans within days from the date of original purchase of each respective loan by the financial institution 
historically  the construction period has been approximately ninety days 
the construction lender has full discretion to accept or decline each individual loan purchase requested by countryplace 
the maximum advance for loans purchased is of the loan amount 
the interest rate on unpaid amounts advanced is 
countryplace had outstanding unpaid advances under the facility of million as of march  the facility contains certain requirements relating to the documentation of the loans purchased and amounts drawn during the construction period of each individual loan  which are customary in the industry 
countryplace funds the difference between the amounts advanced under the facility and the balance of any additional loan 
countryplace currently originates conforming mortgage loans for sale to fannie mae and other investors 
countryplace plans to retain the associated servicing rights 
in addition  countryplace plans to continue holding its remaining portfolio of chattel  non conforming mortgages for investment on a long term basis 
countryplace makes loans to borrowers that it believes are credit worthy based on its credit guidelines 
however  originating and holding loans for investment subjects countryplace to more credit and interest rate risk than originating loans for resale 
the ability of customers to repay their loans may be affected by a number of factors and if customers do not repay their loans  the profitability and cash flow of the loan portfolio would be adversely affected and we may incur additional loan losses 

table of contents at present  asset backed and mortgage backed securitization markets are effectively closed to countryplace and other manufactured housing lenders  and no assurances can be made that a securitization or other term financing market will be available to countryplace in the future 
at such time in the future that any securitization or other term financing market re emerges  countryplace intends to resume originating chattel and non conforming mortgages for its investment portfolio 
while we believe countryplace will be able to obtain liquidity through sales of conforming mortgages to fannie mae and other investors  no assurances can be made that these investors will continue to purchase loans secured by factory built homes  or that countryplace will successfully complete transactions on acceptable terms and conditions  if at all 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed two sale leaseback transactions one transaction was with two members of senior management of the company who are related parties where we sold in total retail sales center properties for million in cash 
one transaction the related party transaction resulted in a million gain which will be amortized over the term of the lease and the other transaction resulted in a million loss which was recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
concurrent with the sale  we leased the properties back for a period of ten years at an aggregate annual rental of million plus escalation under certain circumstances 
the lease is renewable at our option for an additional five years 
we do not have continuing involvement in the properties other than through a normal sale leaseback 
in light of the economic crisis and challenging business environment  our top priorities are cash generation and cash preservation in every area of our operations 
we have been working with a financial advisor to leverage million of unlevered assets in an attempt to generate cash through this uncertain economic environment 
as previously mentioned  we sold million of countryplace s warehoused portfolio of chattel and mortgage loans for a gain of million  obtained a million construction lending line for countryplace to use for financing mortgage loans and completed two sale leaseback transactions for million in cash 
additionally  we took advantage of market conditions and retired million of our convertible senior notes for million of cash  resulting in a gain of million 
we accomplished all these things and still funded million in committed pipeline loans from working capital when our warehouse lender exited the business 
typically our wholesale customers pay within days 
during fiscal  we began building barracks and other housing for the us government 
these government contracts have longer payment periods  which have put pressure on our cash balance 
in response to these cash pressures  on april   the company issued warrants to each of capital southwest venture corporation  sally posey and the estate of lee posey collectively  the lenders to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock of the company at a price of per share  which was the closing price of the company s common stock on april  the warrants were granted in connection with a loan made by the lenders to the company of an aggregate of million pursuant to senior subordinated secured promissory notes between the company and each of the lenders collectively  the promissory notes 
the proceeds were used for working capital purposes 
if the promissory notes are not repaid in full by june   the aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be purchased may be increased by an amount equal to  divided by the closing price of the common stock on june  the warrants  which expire on april   contain anti dilution provisions and other customary provisions 
the promissory notes bear interest at the rate of libor plus and are secured by  shares of standard s common stock 
the promissory notes also restrict the company from selling  leasing or otherwise transferring all or any material portion of its assets or businesses without the lenders consent 
we believe that our cash on hand and the proceeds from floor plan financing  conforming mortgage sales  and any other available borrowing alternatives will be adequate to support our working capital needs and currently planned capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future 
however  our top priorities are cash generation and conservation throughout our operations to help support these cash needs as well 
because future cash flows and the availability of financing will depend on a number of factors  including prevailing economic and financial conditions  business  credit market conditions  and other factors beyond our control  no assurances can be given in this regard 

table of contents contractual obligations dollars in thousands the following tables summarize our contractual obligations  including interest  at march  for additional information related to these obligations  see the notes to consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years floor plan payable debt obligations construction lending line convertible senior notes securitized financing securitized financing repurchase obligations letters of credit operating lease obligations total contractual obligations interest is calculated by applying contractual interest rates to fiscal year end balances 
we have contingent repurchase obligations outstanding at march  which have a finite life but are replaced as we continue to sell our factory built homes to dealers under repurchase agreements with financial institutions 
we did not incur any significant losses related to these contingent repurchase obligations during fiscal  and we have provided letters of credit to providers of certain of our insurance policies 
while the current letters of credit have a finite life  they are subject to renewal at different amounts based on the requirements of the insurance carriers 
we have recorded insurance expense based on anticipated losses related to these policies as is customary in the industry 
the note holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash on may   may  and may  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
recovery of deferred tax asset 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized prior to expiration  we are required to establish a valuation allowance against that portion of our deferred tax assets 
the determination of valuation allowances involves significant management judgment and is based upon the evaluation of both 
table of contents positive and negative evidence  including our best estimates of anticipated taxable profits in the various jurisdictions with which the deferred tax assets are associated 
changes in events or expectations could result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances and material changes to our provision for income taxes 
due to the difficult market environment and the losses we recorded during fiscal and early  we reviewed our deferred tax assets during fiscal to determine whether a valuation allowance was necessary 
in fiscal  we recognized a million valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets which resulted in us recording an income tax provision of approximately million 
in fiscal  we recorded an additional million valuation allowance and an income tax benefit of  if  after future considerations of positive and negative evidence related to the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  we determine a lesser allowance is required  we would record a reduction to income tax expense and the valuation allowance in the period of such determination 
revenue recognition 
retail sales of manufactured homes and certain single story modular homes  including shipping charges  are recognized when a down payment is received  the customer enters into a legally binding sales contract  title has transferred and the home is accepted by the customer  delivered and permanently located at the customer s site 
sales of our commercial buildings  including shipping charges  are recognized when the customer enters into a legally binding sales contract  title has transferred and the home is substantially completed and accepted by the customer 
additionally  for retail sales of all multi story modular homes  nationwide modular homes  and manufactured homes in which we serve as the general contractor with respect to virtually all aspects of the sale and construction process  sales are not recognized until after final consumer closing 
transportation costs  unless borne by the retail customer or independent retailer  are included in the cost of sales 
warranties 
we provide the retail homebuyer a one year limited warranty covering defects in material or workmanship in home structure  plumbing and electrical systems 
we record a liability for estimated future warranty costs relating to homes sold  based upon our assessment of historical experience factors 
factors we use in the estimation of the warranty liability include historical warranty experience related to the actual number of calls and the average cost per call 
although we maintain reserves for such claims based on our assessments as described above  which to date have been adequate  there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate 
a large number of warranty claims exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material effect on our results of operations and liquidity 
transfers of financial assets 
countryplace completed two securitizations of factory built housing loan receivables  both of which were accounted for as financings  which use the portfolio method of accounting in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  where loan contracts are securitized and accounted for as borrowings  interest income is recorded over the life of the loans using the interest method  the loan contracts receivable and the securitization debt asset backed certificates remain on countryplace s balance sheet  and the related interest margin is reflected in the income statement 
the securitizations include provisions for removal of accounts by countryplace and other factors that preclude sale accounting of the securitizations under sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the structure of countryplace s securitizations have no effect on the ultimate amount of profit and cash flow recognized over the life of the loan contracts  except to the extent of surety fees and premiums  trustee fees  backup servicer fees  and securitization issuance costs 
however  the structure does affect the timing of cash receipts 
countryplace services the loan contracts under pooling and servicing agreements with the securitization trusts 
countryplace also retains interests in subordinate classes of securitization bonds that provide over collateralization credit enhancement to senior certificate holders and are subject to risk of loss of interest 
table of contents payments and principal 
as is common in securitizations  countryplace is also liable for customary representations 
we guarantee certain aspects of countryplace s performance as the servicer under the securitization pooling and servicing agreement 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses reflects countryplace s judgment of the probable loss exposure on their loan portfolio as of the end of the reporting period 
countryplace s loan portfolio is comprised of loans related primarily to factory built palm harbor homes 
the allowance for loan losses is developed at a portfolio level and not allocated to specific individual loans or to impaired loans 
a range of probable losses is calculated after giving consideration to  among other things  the composition of the loan portfolio  including historical loss experience by static pool  expected probable losses based on industry knowledge of losses for a given range of borrower credit scores  the composition of the portfolio by credit score and seasoning  and recent loss experience 
countryplace then makes a determination of the best estimate within the range of loan losses 
the accrual of interest is discontinued when either principal or interest is more than days past due 
in addition  loans are placed on nonaccrual status when there is a clear indication that the borrower has the inability or unwillingness to meet payments as they become due 
payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied first to accrued interest and then to principal 
impaired loans  or portions thereof  are charged off when deemed uncollectible 
as of march   countryplace management was not aware of any potential problem loans that would have a material effect on loan delinquency or charge offs 
the portion of the loan portfolio with payments delinquent sixty one or more days has increased to at march  from at march  countryplace management believes this increase is attributable primarily to two factors anticipated increases expected with the aging of the portfolio  and deterioration in general economic conditions  including increasing levels of unemployment and continued house price depreciation in certain states 
based on prior experience with factory built home loan performance  countryplace management expects the incidence of defaults to increase as loans age for the first three to six years of a portfolio life  and then decrease in later years 
the weighted average remaining contractual life of the portfolio increased from months at march  to months at march  this age difference includes the effect of the april  sale of million of loans receivable which had a weighted average age of months 
house price depreciation and economic weakness has continued to adversely affect the rates of delinquency and default in mortgage loan portfolios 
california  florida  and arizona have been especially affected 
with the exception of a concentration of loans receivable in texas  countryplace s loan portfolio is well diversified across states 
accordingly  countryplace s exposure to isolated local or regional economic downturns is  in normal conditions  offset by more favorable economic conditions in other states 
to date  texas has performed better than in other states in the current economic downturn and countryplace s loans receivable concentration in texas has offset the effects of economic weakness in other states 
the portion of countryplace s loans receivable in texas that were days or more past due at march  was  or lower than the delinquency rate for the total loans receivable portfolio 
the portion of countryplace s loans receivable in florida that were past due sixty one days or more at march  increased to from at march  while loans receivable in florida represented of countryplace s total loans receivable at march   florida loans receivable past due days or more represented of total loans receivable at march   up from at march  with the exception of florida  delinquency performance for the company s loans receivable in the three states most severely affected by house price depreciation indicates that the effects of declining house prices in these states in general has had little or no discernable effect to date on the overall performance of countryplace s loans receivable portfolio 
delinquent accounts in arizona and california represent and  respectively  of the total loans receivable balance 

table of contents deteriorating performance of mortgage loans in general has been driven  in large part  by product features such as adjustable rates  interest only payments  payment options  etc 
that have a high propensity to induce payment shock or negative equity  and underwriting practices which relied on the expectation of continuous house price 
countryplace s portfolio is comprised entirely of fixed rate  full amortizing loans 
countryplace s underwriting practices and risk management policies have been based on an assumption that the manufactured home collateral would depreciate  rather than appreciate  in value over the life of the loan 
accordingly  its credit standards are based on both the borrowers capacity to repay the loan as scheduled  and the borrowers history of satisfying repayment obligations 
as a result  countryplace management believes the portfolio is less susceptible to defaults due to adjustable interest rate resets and default losses  since house price depreciation has always been considered in determining countryplace s allowance for loan losses 
allowance for loan losses as of march  was million  or approximately of the million total consumer loans receivable and construction advances balance 
we believe this allowance is adequate for expected loan losses  considering the geographic and loan type concentrations of the portfolio  the age and remaining life of the portfolio  expected overall future credit losses  and recent delinquency experience by geographic area and type of loan collateral 
inventory valuation 
inventory consists of raw material and finished goods factory built homes 
we carry very little land held for development and we do not purchase options to acquire land inventory 
each quarter we assess the recoverability of our inventory by comparing the carrying amount to its estimated net realizable value 
our raw materials consist of home building materials and supplies and turn approximately times per month 
our finished goods consist of homes completed under customer order and homes available for purchase at our retail sales centers 
we evaluate the recoverability of our finished homes by comparing our inventory cost to our estimated sales price  less costs to sell 
we estimate our sales price by product type hud code and modular 
approximately of our inventory is located in texas  where the factory built housing business has not experienced the same declines as california and florida 
historically  the amount of our inventory valuation adjustments has been immaterial 
we are not aware of any trends or other factors that are reasonably likely to result in valuation adjustments in future periods 
these valuations are significantly impacted by estimated average selling prices  average sales rates and product type 
our quarterly assessments reflect management s estimates  which we believe are reasonable 
however  based on the general economic conditions  future results could differ materially from management s judgments and estimates 
new accounting pronouncement in may  the fasb issued fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
fsp apb specifies that issuers of convertible debt instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
in addition  transaction costs incurred with third parties that directly relate to the issuance of convertible debt instruments shall be allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of proceeds and accounted for as debt and equity issuance costs  respectively 
the provisions of fsp apb shall be applied retrospectively to all periods presented when adopted 
the provisions of fsp apb are effective for our convertible notes on march   the beginning of our fiscal year we are currently evaluating the effects of fsp apb on our consolidated financial statements 
however  while our cash payments for interest on the convertible notes will not be affected  based upon current amounts outstanding  we expect that upon adoption we will have higher annual interest expense through may additionally  as the adoption of fsp apb is retrospective  non cash adjustments to increase interest expense in prior periods will be reflected in future filings  along with corresponding non cash adjustments to record the unamortized portion of a debt discount on our convertible notes  reduce retained earnings  increase additional paid in capital  and reflect related income tax effects  as appropriate 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt  which consists primarily of our liabilities under retail floor plan financing arrangements 
for variable interest rate obligations  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
assuming our level of variable rate debt as of march  is held constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates occurring on the first day of the year would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately million 
countryplace is exposed to market risk related to the accessibility and terms of long term financing of its loans 
in the past  countryplace accessed the asset backed securities market to provide term financing of its chattel and non conforming mortgage originations 
at present  asset backed and mortgage backed securitization markets are effectively closed to countryplace and other manufactured housing lenders 
accordingly  it is unlikely that countryplace can continue to securitize its loan originations as a means to obtain long term funding 
this inability to continue to securitize its loans caused countryplace to discontinue origination of chattel loans and non conforming mortgages until other sources of funding are available 
we are also exposed to market risks related to our fixed rate consumer loans receivable balances and our convertible senior notes 
for fixed rate loans receivable  changes in interest rates do not change future earnings and cash flows from the receivables 
however  changes in interest rates could affect the fair market value of the loan portfolio 
assuming countryplace s level of loans held for investment as of march  is held constant  a increase in average interest rates would increase the fair value of countryplace s portfolio by approximately  for our fixed rate convertible senior notes  changes in interest rates could affect the fair market value of the related debt 
assuming the amount of convertible senior notes as of march  is held constant  a decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the notes by approximately million
