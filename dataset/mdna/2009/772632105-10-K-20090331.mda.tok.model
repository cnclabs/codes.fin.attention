item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  contained elsewhere in this document 
general rock of ages is an integrated quarrier and manufacturer of granite and products manufactured from granite 
until january   we were also engaged in the retail sale of memorials 
on january   we sold all of our retail operations and exited the retail business entirely 
the retail division was classified as discontinued operations as of december  accordingly  during  we had two business segments quarry and manufacturing 
the quarry division sells granite blocks to the manufacturing division and to outside manufacturers  as well as to customers outside north america 
the manufacturing division s principal product is granite memorials and mausoleums used primarily in cemeteries  although it also manufactures some specialized granite products for industrial applications 
the retail division primarily sold granite memorials directly to consumers 
in  revenue from our quarry division was flat at million and divisional operating income decreased to million compared to million in the decrease in divisional operating income is solely due to the million inventory write down taken in the fourth quarter of in our export quarries of bethel  salisbury and gardenia 
see the discussion of the inventory write down in this item at results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  quarry segment analysis for a more complete discussion of the reasons for the inventory write down 
excluding the effect of the inventory write down  quarry divisional income would have been million  a increase from the prior year 
during  demand for our granites in export markets continued to rebound from the sharp decline we suffered in  however  domestic demand for our barre gray granite continues to decline slowly 
following is a brief analysis of each of the individual quarries 
we continue to see a slight decline in sales of barre gray granite which is mainly used for memorials 
due to cost cutting measures and production improvements  the gross margin percentage improved percentage points  even though sales were down from levels yielding higher gross margin dollars of  or a increase over we believe that imported granites  which generally are less expensive  are being substituted in the lower end of the memorials market and the color choices among granites in the memorial market has reduced the share of gray granite as a percentage of the market 
the bethel quarry had a good year with a increase in sales 
due to the inventory write down the gross profit was million or an decrease from the prior year 
excluding the inventory write down the quarry had an or  increase in gross margin dollars 
bethel white is popular for building purposes and demand for this granite is still strong with our international customers 
the salisbury pink quarry in north carolina saw a decline in net sales to million and prior to the inventory write down a  decline in gross profit to  after the inventory write down this quarry had a gross loss of million 
we continue to implement a number of measures in the salisbury pink quarry to increase productivity and reduce costs per cubic foot 
we expect to see more of the benefit of these actions in this granite is also mainly used for building purposes 
our gardenia and rockwell white quarries had another difficult year as they continued to struggle with production recovery issues and continued to have negative gross margins  although due to aggressive cost cutting measures and production improvements the cost per cubic foot decreased or in from the year before 
the pennsylvania black quarry net revenue was up  or from and ended with a positive gross profit for the year for the first time in a number of years 
we implemented changes in management and production methods in and and we saw improvements in both recovery and costs per cubic foot 
net sales from our canadian quarries decreased by or  from the loss of a large customer during accounted for most of the decrease in sales 
gross profit was down  or because with the lower level of sales  fixed costs impacted our cost per cubic foot to a greater extent and we incurred more costs as we moved to a better area in the quarry 
we are in a good position to decrease costs in revenue and gross margin were both up in the galactic blue quarry in the ukraine 
the galactic blue quarry is owned by vika ltd in the ukraine  in which we own a one third interest 
in addition  we have exclusive distribution rights to the galactic blue granite 
this granite continues to generate interest and orders  however  production is still poor as vika continues to develop and open the quarry 
vika experienced continuing operational difficulties in as of december  the company had determined that its investment in vika of  had experienced an impairment in value that was other than temporary 
based on that assessment  the company also concluded that its advances to vika should be fully reserved as of december  accordingly  a charge of  was recognized in the fourth quarter of and is separately presented in the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended december  we will continue to aggressively market our granite blocks in the us and abroad and make productivity improvements to control costs and recovery rates 
we believe that most of the productivity challenges we encountered in have been addressed as we move into the manufacturing division s net revenue increased by  compared to however  in  sales to our retail division were excluded from net revenue  whereas net revenue includes approximately million in sales to the previously owned retail locations 
if sales to our retail division were included in net revenue for  then net revenue in would have decreased by million 
in  mausoleum sales decreased by million  other monumental sales increased by million and sales of industrial products increased by  in compared to gross margins decreased in due to the decreased sales of the higher margin mausoleums 
sg a remained relatively flat 
demand for memorials remains steady but mausoleum sales were significantly affected by the continued downturn in the economy 
our backlog at december  is down million from year end and the decrease in the mausoleum backlog is million of the decrease 
we will continue to pursue a strategy of focusing on the mausoleum and large features market where our product is superior and margins are generally higher  as well as increasing our efforts to expand our wholesale distribution system to the cemetery  funeral home and traditional memorial retailers to grow our traditional monument business 
as of december  the retail division was classified as a discontinued operation 
the million loss from discontinued operations in includes a million impairment charge to write the book value of the division to fair value and  in income from operations  which is net of  of interest expense allocated to the discontinued operations 
also see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
critical accounting policies general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee and our independent auditor 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets and long term investments  valuation of deferred tax assets  accounting for pensions and other post employment benefits and excess inventory 
revenue recognition quarry division the granite we quarry is sold both to outside customers and used by our manufacturing group 
our quarry division recognizes revenue from sales of granite blocks to outside customers when the granite is shipped and invoiced from the quarry  except for cases noted below 
we generally provide a discount for domestic customers if payment is made within days of purchase  except in the case of december terms described below 
sales to foreign customers are typically secured by a letter of credit 
at our barre  vermont quarries  we allow customers to purchase granite blocks and at their request we store the blocks for them 
many of our customers do not have adequate storage space at their facilities and want to ensure an adequate supply of blocks  especially when the barre quarries are closed from mid december through march because of weather 
our quarry division recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
blocks are sold when the customer selects and identifies the block at the quarry site  requests the block be stored and they have significant business reasons to do so 
at that time  the block is removed from our inventory  the customer s name is printed on the block  and title and risk of loss pass to the buyer 
the customer is invoiced and normal payment terms apply  except in the case of december terms described below 
granite blocks owned by customers remain on our property for varying periods of time after title passes to the buyer 
we retain a delivery obligation using our trucks 
however  we consider the earnings process substantially complete because the cost of delivery service is inconsequential less than in relation to the price 
further  under industry terms of trade  title passes and the payment obligation is established when the block is identified at the quarry 
each december  we offer special payment terms to our barre quarries customers 
as noted above  from approximately mid december to approximately march  our barre quarries are closed due to weather 
during this time  manufacturing plants remain open and many customers prefer to ensure they own blocks of a size and quality selected by them prior to the quarries closure 
all blocks purchased in december are invoiced on or about december and  at that time  the blocks are removed from inventory  the customer s name is printed on the blocks  and title and risk of loss pass to the buyer 
payment terms are one third of the invoice amount on january  one third on february  and one third on march the program provides essentially the normal day payment terms during the months when the barre quarries are closed notwithstanding the customer purchases a three month supply in december and makes payments over days 
customers need not use these special december terms and may buy from inventory during the closure period on a first come  first served basis with the normal day payment terms 
manufacturing division we record revenue related to internally transferred granite only after the granite is manufactured into a finished product and sold to an outside customer 
manufacturing revenues related to outside customers are recorded when the finished product is shipped from our facilities or set in the cemetery  if we are responsible for the setting  which is when risk of ownership transfers  assuming the other criteria for revenue recognition persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and collectibility is reasonably assured have been met 
revenues related to finished products transferred internally to our owned retail outlets were recorded as revenue by the retail division when ultimately sold to an outside customer 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  sfas no 

such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or change in utilization of property and equipment 
recoverability of the undepreciated cost of property and equipment is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
those cash flows include an estimated terminal value based on a hypothetical sale at the end of the assets depreciation period 
estimating these cash flows and terminal values requires management to make judgments about the growth in demand for our products  sustainability of gross margins  and our ability to achieve economies of scale 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
valuation of deferred tax assets in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not some portion or all of the current and deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of current and deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
this assessment is made each reporting period 
at the end of the second quarter of  based on the level of taxable income and projections for future taxable income  the company believed it was no longer more likely than not that it would generate the required taxable income to fully realize the benefit of the net us deferred tax assets 
therefore  we adjusted our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets by recording a tax expense of million in the second quarter of to fully reserve for the entire net us deferred tax asset 
at the end of each of the subsequent periods we reached a similar conclusion  therefore we have continued to fully reserve for the entire net us deferred tax asset 
we will continue to assess the valuation allowance on a regular basis and may reduce the valuation allowance when the company has taxable income from its us operations in the future 
accounting for pensions and other post employment benefits we provide defined benefit pension and other post employment benefit plans for certain employees 
accounting for these plans requires the use of actuarial assumptions including estimates on the expected long term rate of return on assets  discount rates and  to a lesser extent  the rate of increase in health care costs due to the small number of individuals receiving this benefit 
the expected long term rate of return has remained the same at and reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
in  we kept the discount rate used to determine our liability in the pension plans at  the same discount rate used at december  in both years this rate was determined on a bond matching model which uses data on individual high quality corporate bonds and the timing and amount of the future benefit payments in our plan to develop a weighted discount rate specific to our plan 
on january   the company s board of directors approved actions to proceed with amendments to its defined benefit pension plan by freezing membership and future benefits in the plan 
this action is effective as of march  in order to make informed assumptions  we rely on outside actuarial experts as well as public market data and general economic information 
any changes in one or more of these assumptions may materially affect certain amounts reported on our balance sheet 
in particular  a decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets or a decrease in discount rate could result in an increase in our pension liability and a charge to equity as well as increases in pension expenses over time 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the specific annual average cost method for the quarry segment and the specific cost method for the manufacturing segment 
inventory is reviewed regularly for excess inventory based on an estimated forecast of product demand 
inventories that are in excess of future requirements are written down to their estimated value based upon projected demand 
demand for our products can be forecasted based on current orders  age of the inventory and discussions with customers 
although management makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of its forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have an impact on the level of excess material in our inventories and operating results could be affected accordingly 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain historical statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenues with the exception of quarry and manufacturing gross profit and sg a  which are shown as a percentage of their respective divisions revenues 
year ended december  statement of operations data net revenues quarry manufacturing total net revenues cost of goods sold quarry quarry inventory write down manufacturing total cost of goods sold gross profit quarry manufacturing total gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses quarry manufacturing corporate overhead impairment of long lived asset impairment of investment and advances insurance recovery quarry asset foreign exchange loss other income  net total sg a expenses income loss from continuing operations interest expense loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes loss from continuing operations discontinued operations net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  on a consolidated basis for all segments for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   revenue increased slightly  gross profit decreased due to the inventory write down and total selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased for reasons discussed in detail in the segment analysis below 
quarry segment analysis revenues in our quarry operations for the year ended december  decreased from shipments in were higher than in our bethel  pennsylvania and galactic blue quarries 
all of the other quarries saw decreases from to 
see the discussion in this item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general for a detailed discussion of each quarry 
gross profit decreased million solely due to the million inventory write down taken in the fourth quarter of in our export quarries of bethel  salisbury and gardenia 
with the rapid increase in freight costs and changing economic conditions  we have seen a change in what our export customers will accept for inventory 
in the past  a second grade or b block would be accepted if the price was right and the customer felt it would be worthwhile to take the block and try to trim off the imperfections 
now that the shipping costs can be up to of the price of the block  fewer customers are willing to purchase b blocks and therefore we are selling fewer of them 
we reevaluated the b block inventory and removed any blocks that we believe export customers would not buy 
this resulted in a non cash charge of million taken in the fourth quarter of sg a expenses in our quarry segment for decreased or  from primarily due to a  decrease in administrative and sales salaries and benefits  a  decrease in administrative office expenses due to the move from our former corporate headquarters  gain on the sale of non productive quarry assets of  and  in decreased travel and related expenses 
manufacturing segment analysis the manufacturing division s net revenue increased by  compared to however  in  sales to our retail division were excluded from net revenue  whereas net revenue includes approximately million in sales to the previously owned retail locations 
if sales to our retail division were included in net revenue for  then net revenue in would have decreased by million 
in  mausoleum sales decreased by million  other monumental sales increased by million and sales of industrial products increased by  in compared to gross profit dollars from the manufacturing group decreased or  and gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased percentage points for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in gross profit margin is due to the decreased sales of higher margin mausoleums 
demand for memorials remains steady but mausoleum sales were significantly affected by the continued downturn in the economy 
sg a expenses for the manufacturing group were up  or from the prior year primarily as a result of increased sales salaries  benefits and related expenses and bad debt expense offset by a decrease in commissions due to the decrease in mausoleum sales 
consolidated items unallocated corporate overhead decreased  or million from the prior year 
we consolidated our corporate headquarters in the manufacturing plant s existing administrative offices and decreased staff in conjunction with this move and the sale of the retail division 
the majority of this decrease can be attributed to decreased salary and benefit costs of  no canadian withholding tax of  in  decreased professional service fees of  decreased office supplies  postage  telephone  vehicles and related expenses due to decreased staff of  and decreased investor relations costs of  due to the consolidation of our corporate headquarters in the manufacturing plant s existing offices  the company had a change in the use of its corporate headquarters building located at graniteville road  which we concluded to be a triggering event under sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

we determined that the forecasted undiscounted cash flows related to the building and land was less than its carrying value 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of  to reduce the carrying value of the building and land to its estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value was based on a discounted cash flow analysis and included consultation with an outside professional real estate appraiser 
no assurance can be given that the underlying estimates and assumptions utilized in our determination of an asset s new carrying value will materialize as anticipated 
at december   management had not made the decision to sell this building and continued to classify it as part of property  plant and equipment 
in a charge of  was recognized in the fourth quarter due to our investment in vika experiencing an impairment in value that was other than temporary and fully reserving for advances to vika 
late in  an incident with a derrick in our barre quarry resulted in significant damage to the derrick 
we have received insurance recoveries totaling  that restored the derrick to usefulness 
these payments have been recognized in the period they were received and  was received in foreign exchange gains in were  compared to a loss in of  resulting from the effect of the fluctuating value of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar on transactions that are originated in us dollars in our canadian operations 
total interest expense was approximately million in as compared to million in total interest expense in is made up of million in continuing operations and  in discontinued operations 
total interest expense decreased million or from primarily as a result of the decrease in debt as well as lower interest rates in interest expense from continuing operations decreased from million to million in the income tax expense for was  compared with  for the tax expense in both years reflects taxes at our canadian subsidiary 
at the end of the second quarter of  based on the level of taxable income and projections for future taxable income  the company determined it was no longer more likely than not that it would generate the required taxable income to fully realize the benefit of the net us deferred tax asset 
this resulted in a charge to tax expense of million in the second quarter of this action did not affect the cash taxes paid by the company 
in each subsequent quarter since then  we have reached a similar conclusion  therefore we have continued to fully reserve for the entire net us deferred tax asset 
we will continue to assess the valuation allowance on a regular basis and may reduce the valuation allowance when the company has taxable income from us operations in the future 
we had a loss from discontinued operations of  in compared to million in the loss is made up of  of operating losses and  of allocated interest 
the loss is made up of income from the discontinued retail operations of  an impairment charge to write down the retail division to its fair market value of million and interest expense allocated to discontinued operations of  liquidity and capital resources in light of the current economic situation  we have also evaluated our future liquidity needs  both from a short term and long term year basis 
we believe that cash on hand plus cash generated from operations along with cash available under credit lines are expected to be sufficient in to service debt  finance capital expenditures  fund operations and fund the pension plan  if necessary 
to provide for long term liquidity  we believe we can generate substantial positive cash flow  as well as obtain additional capital  if necessary  from the use of subordinated debt or equity 
in the event that our current capital resources are not sufficient to fund requirements  we believe our access to additional capital resources would be sufficient to meet our needs  although the financing terms available could be significantly different than our current terms 
historically  we have met our short term liquidity requirements primarily from cash generated by operating activities and periodic borrowings under the commercial credit facilities described below 
our credit facility with our lenders was renewed on october  for a term of five years 
in january  we received million in net proceeds from the sale of the retail division 
we applied million of these proceeds to the long term debt and million to the revolving credit facility 
due to the recent significant worldwide decline in equity prices and the value of other financial investments  the fair value of the assets held by our defined benefit pension plan decreased by million in as a result  the plan is significantly under funded 
we have historically contributed between  and million per year to the plan 
we contributed  in and expect to contribute  for contributions 
due to the large decrease in our funded status we may be required to contribute an additional amount of between million and million  depending on the value of the plan assets as of the end of in august  the pension protection act was signed into law 
among other things  the act is aimed at strengthening pension plans by requiring most pension plans to become fully funded over a seven year period 
the worker  retiree  and employer recovery act of hr was signed into law in late december the company is studying the impact of this legislation on the funding requirements of the act 
we will continue the process of funding the unfunded liability which  we believe  we will be able to fund either from cash from operations or borrowing under our credit facilities 
see item a  risk factors and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our primary need for capital will be to maintain and improve our quarrying and manufacturing facilities 
we have approximately million budgeted for capital expenditures in cash flow at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  and working capital of approximately million  compared to approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and working capital of approximately million at december  the decrease in working capital is mainly due to the decrease in inventory of million  of which million was related to the non cash impairment charge 
this decrease was offset by a million increase in accounts receivable due to very late in the year quarry sales 
the decrease in current assets was offset by an million decrease in current borrowings  which is made up of million from the proceeds of the sale of the retail division plus an additional  from operations 
cash from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the million net loss in is adjusted by the non cash impairment charges of million and depreciation of million and offset by a large increase in accounts receivable along with decreases in accounts payable  customer deposits and pension liabilities 
the million net loss is adjusted by the non cash impairment charge on the write down of the retail division of million and the impairment charge on our vika related assets of million and depreciation of million 
this was offset by a million increase in inventory coupled with decreases in accounts payable and accruals of  cash from investing activities 
cash flows provided by investing activities were million in compared to cash flows used in investing activities of million in in our capital spending was million compared to million in in  proceeds from the sale of the retail division totaled million and proceeds from sales of property  plant and equipment totaled  compared to  in cash from financing activities 
financing activities used million in compared to million in in our line of credit was reduced by million and million was paid on our long term debt 
this compares to a million decrease under our line of credit and million paid on our long term debt in in we also had  in cash provided from employees exercising stock options which was offset by increased debt issuance costs of  associated with the renewal of our credit facility 
cash flow from discontinued operations 
the cash flow from discontinued operations are included in the cash flow from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
if stated separately  the net cash flow from discontinued operations was an increase of  made up of  provided by operations   provided by investing activities and  used in financing activities in the absence of cash flows due to discontinued operations is not expected to significantly affect the company s future liquidity or capital resources 
credit facility we have a credit facility with the cit group business credit and chittenden trust company lenders that is scheduled to expire in october and is secured by substantially all assets of the company located in the united states 
the facility consists of an acquisition term loan line of credit of up to million and a revolving credit facility of up to another million based on eligible accounts receivable  inventory and certain fixed assets 
amounts outstanding were  and  as of december  and  and  as of december   on the revolving credit facility and the term loan line of credit  respectively 
unused availability under the revolving credit facility was  as of december  the weighted average interest rate was and on the revolving credit facility in and  respectively 
the credit facility loan agreement places restrictions on our ability to  among other things  sell assets  participate in mergers  incur debt  pay dividends  make capital expenditures  repurchase stock and make investments or guarantees  without pre approval by the lenders 
the credit facility agreement also contains certain covenants for a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a limit on the total liabilities to net worth ratio of the company 
minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the facility requires the ratio of the sum of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  to the sum of income taxes paid  capital expenditures  interest and scheduled debt repayments be at least for any trailing twelve month period at the end of a quarter through december  and beginning with the first quarter of primarily as a result of operating losses in and first quarter  we were in violation of this covenant in the first quarter of and received a waiver of this covenant from the lenders 
due to the non cash impairment charges on the write down of inventory and the corporate building we were in violation of the covenant at december  we received a waiver of this covenant from the lenders and amended the agreement 
as a result of the amendment the unused line fee went from 
to 
and the existing interest rate pricing grid was changed as follows revolving credit facility term loan previous rate formula prime or libor prime 
or libor amended rate formula prime or libor prime or libor total liabilities to net worth ratio 
our credit facility also requires that the ratio of our total liabilities to net worth the leverage ratio not exceed the leverage ratio excludes from the calculation the change in tangible net worth directly resulting from the company s compliance with sfas no 
of up to million 
in relevant part  sfas no 
required us to place on our books certain unrecognized and unfunded retirement liabilities as of december  as of december   we were in compliance with the leverage ratio covenant 
interest rates 
we have a multi tiered interest rate structure on our outstanding debt with the lenders 
we can elect the interest rate structure under the credit facility based on the prime rate or libor for both the revolving credit facility and the term loan 
the incremental rate above or below prime and above libor is based on our funded debt to net worth ratio 
based on this ratio  our current rates are basis points higher than the lowest incremental rates currently available to us 
the rates in effect as of december  were as follows amount outstanding formula effective rate revolving credit facility million prime term loan a million prime 
pts 
canadian credit facility the company s canadian subsidiary has a line of credit agreement with the royal bank of canada that is renewable annually 
under the terms of this agreement  a maximum of million cdn may be advanced based on eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory  and tangible fixed assets 
the line of credit bears interest at the us prime rate 
there was and  cdn outstanding as of december  and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of our operating leases  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  and we do not have  nor do we engage in  transactions with any special purpose entities 
seasonality historically  the company s operations have experienced certain seasonal patterns 
generally  our net sales have been highest in the second or third quarter and lowest in the first quarter of each year due primarily to weather 
cemeteries in northern areas generally do not accept granite memorials during winter months when the ground is frozen because they cannot be properly set under those conditions 
in addition  we typically close certain of our vermont and canadian quarries during these months because of increased operating costs attributable to adverse weather conditions 
as a result  we have historically incurred a net loss during the first three months of each calendar year
