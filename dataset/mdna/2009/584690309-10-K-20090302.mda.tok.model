you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  which are included in this form k 
certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below and elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
see risk factors in item a of this form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements in this report 
our md a is composed of four major sections  executive summary  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates 
restatement on november   we restated our financial statements for the annual  transition and quarterly periods in fiscal years through and the first and second quarters of in our amended form k a for the year ended december  and our amended forms q a for the quarterly periods ended march  and june  the restatement principally related to an error in our interpretation and application of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists sfas  as it applied to a component of our sales return reserve calculations 
during the third quarter of  management commenced a review and analysis of its accounting for sales return reserves after the public company accounting oversight board s the pcaob inspection of our independent public accounting firm s  ernst young llp s  audit of our financial statements 
based on the pcaob inspection  ernst young llp informed management that the method of accounting for returns of short dated and expired goods in the periods covered by the financial statements was not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  as the returns for expired product did not qualify for warranty or exchange accounting and  accordingly  under sfas  the company should have deferred the full sales price of the product for the amount of estimated returns 
management conducted a review of whether the reserve complied with sfas and whether the amounts involved were material under sab and sab for one or more periods 
management determined that there was an error in our interpretation and application of sfas and that the adjustments necessary to properly state the sales returns reserve were material for the annual  transition  and quarterly periods in fiscal through and the first and second quarters of accordingly  management recommended to the audit committee that a restatement was required 
our prior accounting method with respect to sales return reserves accrued estimated future returns of short dated and expired products  which were expected to be replaced with similar products  at replacement cost  based on our view of the economic impact of returns on our business  rather than deferring the gross sales price 
the replacement of short dated and expired products  which was treated as a warranty or an exchange  was reserved for based on the estimated cost associated with the exchange 
in the course of our review and analysis  we determined that  although the exchanged product was similar  it was not of the same quality  strictly due to dating  as we were replacing nearly expired or expired product with newer  fresher product 
therefore  in accordance with sfas  we revised our reserve calculations to defer the gross sales value of the estimated product returns that were expected to be replaced with similar products 
the revised reserve calculations were developed based on conditions that existed at the end of each reporting period and in certain cases were revised based on the company s actual return experience 
additionally  because of the impact of the changes in the sales returns reserve  we recorded adjustments to certain managed care  medicaid and consumer rebate accruals and also reflected the related income tax effects of these adjustments 
in addition  related to the modification of the reserve calculation methodology  the reserve for estimated future returns was classified within current liabilities rather than as an allowance reducing accounts receivable 

table of contents the restatement of our consolidated financial statements included other adjustments  including adjustments related to conforming our historical accounting policies to current accounting policies that were previously identified  but not previously recorded  as they were not material  either individually or in the aggregate 
while none of these other adjustments were individually material  they were made as part of the restatement process 
these other adjustments included the reclassification of certain amounts in prior year financial statements to conform to the financial statement presentation  including the reclassification of donated product to charitable organizations from selling  general and administrative expenses to cost of product revenues 
throughout the following md a  all referenced amounts for prior periods and prior period comparisons reflect the balances and amounts on a restated basis 
executive summary we are a leading independent specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on helping patients attain a healthy and youthful appearance and self image through the development and marketing in the us of products for the treatment of dermatological  aesthetic and podiatric conditions 
we also market products in canada for the treatment of dermatological and aesthetic conditions and began commercial efforts in europe with our acquisition of liposonix in july we offer a broad range of products addressing various conditions or aesthetics improvements  including facial wrinkles  acne  fungal infections  rosacea  hyperpigmentation  photoaging  psoriasis  seborrheic dermatitis and cosmesis improvement in the texture and appearance of skin 
our current product lines are divided between the dermatological and non dermatological fields 
the dermatological field represents products for the treatment of acne and acne related dermatological conditions and non acne dermatological conditions 
the non dermatological field represents products for the treatment of urea cycle disorder and contract revenue 
our acne and acne related dermatological product lines include dynacin  plexion  solodyn  triaz and ziana 
our non acne dermatological product lines include loprox  perlane  restylane and vanos 
our non dermatological product lines include ammonul and buphenyl 
our non dermatological field also includes contract revenues associated with licensing agreements and authorized generic agreements  and liposonix revenues 
financial information about segments we operate in one significant business segment pharmaceuticals 
our current pharmaceutical franchises are divided between the dermatological and non dermatological fields 
information on revenues  operating income  identifiable assets and supplemental revenue of our business franchises appears in the consolidated financial statements included in item hereof 
key aspects of our business we derive a majority of our revenue from our primary products perlane  restylane  solodyn  triaz  vanos and ziana 
we believe that sales of our primary products will constitute a significant portion of our revenue for we have built our business by executing a four part growth strategy promoting existing brands  developing new products and important product line extensions  entering into strategic collaborations and acquiring complementary products  technologies and businesses 
our core philosophy is to cultivate high integrity relationships of trust and confidence with the foremost dermatologists and podiatrists and the leading plastic surgeons in the us we rely on third parties to manufacture our products 
we estimate customer demand for our prescription products primarily through use of third party syndicated data sources which track prescriptions written by health care providers and dispensed by licensed pharmacies 
the data represents extrapolations from information provided only by certain pharmacies and are estimates of historical demand levels 
we estimate customer demand for our non prescription products primarily through internal data that we compile 
we observe trends from these data and  coupled with certain proprietary information  prepare demand forecasts that are the basis for our purchase orders for finished and component inventory from our third party manufacturers and suppliers 
our forecasts may fail to accurately anticipate ultimate customer demand for our 
table of contents products 
overestimates of demand and sudden changes in market conditions may result in excessive inventory production and underestimates may result in inadequate supply of our products in channels of distribution 
we schedule our inventory purchases to meet anticipated customer demand 
as a result  miscalculation of customer demand or relatively small delays in our receipt of manufactured products could result in revenues being deferred or lost 
our operating expenses are based upon anticipated sales levels  and a high percentage of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
we sell our products primarily to major wholesalers and retail pharmacy chains 
approximately of our gross revenues are typically derived from two major drug wholesale concerns 
depending on the customer  we recognize revenue at the time of shipment to the customer  or at the time of receipt by the customer  net of estimated provisions 
consequently  variations in the timing of revenue recognition could cause significant fluctuations in operating results from period to period and may result in unanticipated periodic earnings shortfalls or losses 
we have recently entered into distribution services agreements with our two largest wholesale customers 
we review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers by reviewing periodic inventory reports that are supplied to us by our major wholesalers in accordance with the distribution services agreements 
we rely wholly upon our wholesale and drug chain customers to effect the distribution allocation of substantially all of our prescription products 
we believe our estimates of trade inventory levels of our products  based on our review of the periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and the estimated demand for our products based on prescription and other data  are reasonable 
we further believe that inventories of our products among wholesale customers  taken as a whole  are similar to those of other specialty pharmaceutical companies  and that our trade practices  which periodically involve volume discounts and early payment discounts  are typical of the industry 
we periodically offer promotions to wholesale and chain drugstore customers to encourage dispensing of our prescription products  consistent with prescriptions written by licensed health care providers 
because many of our prescription products compete in multi source markets  it is important for us to ensure the licensed health care providers dispensing instructions are fulfilled with our branded products and are not substituted with a generic product or another therapeutic alternative product which may be contrary to the licensed health care providers recommended and prescribed medicis brand 
we believe that a critical component of our brand protection program is maintenance of full product availability at drugstore and wholesale customers 
we believe such availability reduces the probability of local and regional product substitutions  shortages and backorders  which could result in lost sales 
we expect to continue providing favorable terms to wholesale and retail drug chain customers as may be necessary to ensure the fullest possible distribution of our branded products within the pharmaceutical chain of commerce 
from time to time we may enter into business arrangements eg loans or investments involving our customers and those arrangements may be reviewed by federal and state regulators 
purchases by any given customer  during any given period  may be above or below actual prescription volumes of any of our products during the same period  resulting in fluctuations of product inventory in the distribution channel 

table of contents as described in more detail below  the following significant events and transactions occurred during  and affected our results of operations  our cash flows and our financial condition reduction in the carrying value of our investment in revance  acceptance of reloxin bla by the fda  repurchase of our contingent convertible senior notes due acquisition of liposonix  lease exit costs related to our previous headquarters facility  strategic collaboration with impax  and other than temporary impairment of auction rate securities investments 
reduction in the carrying value of our investment in revance on december   we announced a strategic collaboration with revance  a privately held  venture backed development stage company  whereby we made an equity investment in revance and purchased an option to acquire revance or to license exclusively in north america revance s novel topical botulinum toxin type a product currently under clinical development 
the consideration to be paid to revance upon our exercise of the option will be at an amount that will approximate the then fair value of revance or the license of the product under development  as determined by an independent appraisal 
the option period will extend through the end of phase testing in the united states 
in consideration for our million payment  we received preferred stock representing an approximate percent ownership in revance  or approximately percent on a fully diluted basis  and the option to acquire revance or to license the product under development 
the million is expected to be used by revance primarily for the development of the product 
approximately million of the million payment represents the fair value of the investment in revance at the time of the investment and was included in other long term assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  the remaining million  which is non refundable and is expected to be utilized in the development of the new product  represents the residual value of the option to acquire revance or to license the product under development and was recognized as research and development expense during the three months ended december  we estimate the net realizable value of the revance investment based on a hypothetical liquidation at book value approach as of the reporting date  unless a quantitative valuation metric is available for these purposes such as the completion of an equity financing by revance 
the amount or our investment that will be expensed periodically is uncertain due to the timing of revance s expenditures for research and development of the product  and any charges will not be immediately  if ever  deductible for income tax purposes and will increase our effective tax rate 
further equity investments  if any  will also be subject to the same accounting treatment as our original equity investment 
during  we reduced the carrying value of our investment in revance and recorded a related charge to earnings of approximately million as a result of a reduction in the estimated net realizable value of the investment using the hypothetical liquidation at book value approach as of december  acceptance of reloxin bla by the fda on march   we entered into a development and distribution agreement with ipsen  whereby ipsen granted to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries the rights to develop  distribute and commercialize ipsen s botulinum toxin type a product in the united states  canada and japan for aesthetic use by physicians 
the product is commonly referred to as reloxin in the us aesthetic market and dysport in medical and aesthetic markets outside the us the product is not currently approved for use in the us  canada or japan 
in may  the fda accepted the filing of ipsen s bla for reloxin  and in accordance with the agreement  we paid ipsen million during the three months ended june  upon achievement of this milestone 
the million was recognized as a charge to research and development expense in our consolidated statement of operations during the three months ended june  
table of contents additionally  during the three months ended december   we paid ipsen million upon the successful completion of an additional regulatory milestone 
the million was recognized as a charge to research and development expense in our consolidated statement of operations during the three months ended december  we will pay ipsen an additional million upon the product s approval by the fda and million upon regulatory approval of the product in japan 
repurchase of our contingent convertible senior notes due in accordance with the terms of our contingent convertible senior notes due the new notes  holders of the new notes were able to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their new notes on june   at of the principal amount of the new notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any  to the date of the repurchase  payable in cash 
prior to june   approximately million in principal amount of the new notes was outstanding 
holders of approximately million of new notes elected to require us to repurchase their new notes on june  we paid million  plus accrued and unpaid interest of approximately million  to the holders of new notes that elected to require us to repurchase their new notes 
we also were required to pay an accumulated deferred tax liability of approximately million related to the repurchased new notes 
this million deferred tax liability was paid during the second half of following the repurchase of these new notes   of principal amount of new notes remained outstanding as of december  acquisition of liposonix on july   we  through our wholly owned subsidiary donatello  inc  acquired liposonix  an independent  privately held company that employs a staff of approximately scientists  engineers and clinicians located near seattle  washington 
liposonix is a medical device company developing non invasive body sculpting technology  and recently launched its first product in europe  where it is being marketed and sold through distributors 
the liposonix technology is currently not approved for sale or use in the us under terms of the transaction  we paid million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of liposonix 
in addition  we will pay liposonix stockholders certain milestone payments up to an additional million upon fda approval of the liposonix technology and if various commercial milestones are achieved on a worldwide basis 
as part of the acquisition of liposonix  the estimated fair value of liposonix in process research and development was determined to be million 
this million amount was recognized as in process research and development expense during the three months ended september  the operating results of liposonix for the six months ended december  are included in our consolidated statement of operations for the full six month period  as the acquisition closed on july  the operating results of liposonix are not included in our consolidated statement of operations for any other periods 
lease exit costs related to our previous headquarters facility in connection with occupancy of our new headquarter office  we ceased use of the prior headquarter office  which consists of approximately  square feet of office space  at an average annual expense of approximately million  under an amended lease agreement that expires in december under sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  a liability for the costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized when the liability is incurred 
in accordance with sfas  we recorded lease exit costs of approximately million during the three months ended september  consisting of the initial liability of million and accretion expense of million 
no costs related to this lease were recorded during the three months ended december  these amounts were recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
strategic collaboration with impax on november   we entered into a license and settlement agreement and a joint development agreement with impax 
in connection with the license and settlement agreement  we and impax agreed to terminate all legal disputes between us relating to solodyn 
additionally  under terms of the license and 
table of contents settlement agreement  impax confirmed that our patents relating to solodyn are valid and enforceable  and cover impax s activities relating to its generic product under anda under the terms of the license and settlement agreement  impax has a license to market its generic versions of solodyn mg  mg and mg under the solodyn intellectual property rights belonging to us upon the occurrence of specific events 
upon launch of its generic formulations of solodyn  impax may be required to pay us a royalty  based on sales of those generic formulations by impax under terms described in the license and settlement agreement 
under the joint development agreement  we and impax will collaborate on the development of five strategic dermatology product opportunities  including an advanced form solodyn product 
under terms of the agreement  we made an initial payment of million upon execution of the agreement 
in addition  we are required to pay up to million upon successful completion of certain clinical and commercial milestones 
we will also make royalty payments based on sales of the advanced form solodyn product if and when it is commercialized by us upon approval by the fda 
we will share equally in the gross profit of the other four development products if and when they are commercialized by impax upon approval by the fda 
the million payment was recognized as a charge to research and development expense during the three months ended december  other than temporary impairment of auction rate securities investments as of december   our investments included auction rate floating securities with a fair value of million 
our auction rate floating securities are debt instruments with a long term maturity and with an interest rate that is reset in short intervals through auctions 
during the three months ended march   we were informed that there was insufficient demand at auction for the auction rate floating securities  and since that time we have been unable to liquidate our holdings in such securities 
as a result  these affected auction rate floating securities are now considered illiquid  and we could be required to hold them until they are redeemed by the holder at maturity or until a future auction on these investments is successful 
as a result of the continued lack of liquidity of these investments  we recorded an other than temporary impairment loss of million during on our auction rate floating securities  based on our estimate of the fair value of these investments  which is reflected as a charge to other expense during the three months ended december  global economic conditions recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and recession in most major economies continuing into as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers 
these factors have lead to a decrease in spending by consumers 
continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and prolonged declines in business and consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs  and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers

factors affecting the future cash flows of the esoterica intangible asset included a notice of proposed rulemaking by the fda for an nda to be required for continued marketing of hydroquinone products  such as esoterica 
esoterica is currently an over the counter product line  and we do not plan to invest in obtaining an approved nda for this product line if this proposed rule is made final without change 
research and development expenses the following table sets forth our research and development expenses for and dollar amounts in millions change change research and development charges included in research and development share based compensation expense included in research and development included in research and development expense for was million related to our option to acquire revance or to license revance s product currently under development and million of share based compensation  which included a reversal of previously recognized share based compensation expense of approximately million due to the cancellation of share based awards during the third quarter of included in research and development expense for was million related to the development and distribution agreement with ipsen for the development of reloxin and approximately million of share based compensation expense 
the primary product under development during and was reloxin 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the timing of the achievement of development milestones under license and development agreements  as well as the timing of other development projects and the funds available to support these projects 
we expect to incur significant research and development expenses related to the development of reloxin each quarter throughout the development process 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses during increased million  or  to million from million during this increase included amortization related to a million milestone payment made to q med related to the fda approval of perlane capitalized during the second quarter of this increase in amortization was partially offset by a decrease in amortization due to the write down of intangible assets due to impairment during the third quarter of the remaining amortizable lives of these intangible assets were also shortened 
these intangible assets had an aggregate cost basis of approximately million and were being amortized at a rate of approximately million per quarter 
these intangible assets were written down to an aggregate new cost basis of approximately million  and are being amortized at an aggregate rate of approximately million per quarter 
interest and investment income interest and investment income during increased million  or  to million from million during  due to an increase in the funds available for investment and an increase in the interest rates achieved by our invested funds during interest expense interest expense during decreased million  to million in from million in our interest expense in and consisted of interest expense on our old notes  which accrue interest at per annum  our new notes  which accrue interest at per annum  and amortization of fees and other origination costs related to the issuance of the old notes and new notes 
the decrease in interest expense during as compared to was due to the fees and origination costs related to the issuance of the old notes becoming fully amortized during the second quarter of see note in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the old notes and new notes

the income tax benefit recorded in is primarily due to our pre tax loss recognized during the effective tax rate for of includes a million tax charge recorded during the fourth quarter of relating to a valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax asset associated with the expensing of the option to acquire revance or license revance s product that is under development 
the expense is currently an unrealized loss for tax purposes 
the company will not be able to determine the character of the loss until the company exercises or fails to exercise its option 
a realized loss characterized as a capital loss can only be utilized to offset capital gains 
the company recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with this unrealized tax loss to reduce the carrying value to  which is the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized

in addition  we may consider incurring additional indebtedness and issuing additional debt or equity securities in the future to fund potential acquisitions or investments  to refinance existing debt or for general corporate purposes 
if a material acquisition or investment is completed  our operating results and financial condition could change materially in future periods 
however  no assurance can be given that additional funds will be available on satisfactory terms  or at all  to fund such activities 
on july   we acquired liposonix  an independent  privately held company that employs a staff of approximately scientists  engineers and clinicians located near seattle  washington 
liposonix is a medical device company developing non invasive body sculpting technology  and recently launched its first product in europe  where it is being marketed and sold through distributors 
the liposonix technology is currently not approved for sale or use in the united states 
under terms of the transaction  we paid million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of liposonix 
in addition  we will pay liposonix stockholders certain milestone payments up to an additional million upon fda approval of the liposonix technology and if various commercial milestones are achieved on a worldwide basis 
as of december   our short term investments included million of auction rate floating securities 
our auction rate floating securities are debt instruments with a long term maturity and with an interest rate that is reset in short intervals through auctions 
during the three months ended march   we were informed that there was insufficient demand at auction for the auction rate floating securities  and since that time we have been unable to liquidate our holdings in such securities 
as a result  these affected auction rate floating securities are now considered illiquid  and we could be required to hold them until they are redeemed by the holder at maturity or until a future auction on these investments is successful 
as a result of the continued lack of liquidity of these investments  we recorded an other than temporary impairment loss of million during on our auction rate floating securities  based on our estimate of the fair value of these investments 
during july  we executed a lease agreement for new headquarter office space to accommodate our expected long term growth 
the first phase is for approximately  square feet with the right to expand 
we occupied the new headquarter office space  which is located approximately one mile from our previous headquarter office space in scottsdale  arizona  during the second quarter of there is no cash obligation for lease payments until we obtained possession of the leased premises and therefore began accruing rent expense during the first quarter of rent expense recognized during related to this property was approximately million 
during the first quarter of  we received approximately million in tenant improvement incentives from the landlord 
this amount has been capitalized into leasehold improvements and is being depreciated on a straight line basis over the lesser of the useful life or the term of the lease 
the tenant improvement incentives are also included in other long term liabilities as deferred rent  and will be recognized as a reduction of rent expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
in  upon vacating our previous headquarters facility  we recorded a charge for the estimated remaining net cost for the lease  net of potential sublease income  of million 
see contingent convertible senior notes and other long term commitments 
during  we began designing and implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system to integrate and improve the financial and operational aspects of our business

the change was primarily due to the net sales or purchases of our short term and long term investments during the respective periods 
during  million was used for the acquisition of liposonix and during  million was paid to q med upon the fda s approval of perlane and million was paid to revance related to our investment in revance million classified as a long term asset  million recognized as research and development expense 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december  was million  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million during the year ended december  cash used in financing activities during included the repurchase of million of new notes during june proceeds from the exercise of stock options were million during compared to million during dividends paid during were million compared to million during contingent convertible senior notes and other long term commitments we have two outstanding series of contingent convertible senior notes  consisting of million principal amount of contingent convertible senior notes due the old notes and million principal amount of contingent convertible senior notes due the new notes 
in accordance with the terms of our new notes  holders of the new notes were able to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their new notes on june   at of the principal amount of the new notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any  to the date of the repurchase  payable in cash 
prior to june   approximately million in principal amount of the new notes was outstanding 
holders of approximately million of new notes elected to require us to repurchase their new notes on june  we paid million  plus accrued and unpaid interest of approximately million  to the holders of new notes that elected to require us to repurchase their new notes 
we also were required to pay an accumulated deferred tax liability of approximately million related to the repurchased new notes 
this million deferred tax liability was paid during the second half of following the repurchase of these new notes   of principal amount of new notes remained outstanding as of december  the new notes and the old notes are unsecured and do not contain any restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness or the repurchase of our securities  and do not contain any financial covenants 
the old 
table of contents notes do not contain any restrictions on the payment of dividends 
the new notes require an adjustment to the conversion price if the cumulative aggregate of all current and prior dividend increases above per share would result in at least a one percent increase in the conversion price 
this threshold has not been reached and no adjustment to the conversion price has been made 
on june  and or upon the occurrence of a change in control  holders of the old notes may require us to offer to repurchase their old notes for cash 
on june  and or upon the occurrence of a change in control  holders of the new notes may require us to offer to repurchase their new notes for cash 
except for the new notes and old notes  we had only million of long term liabilities at december  and we had only million of current liabilities at december  our other commitments and planned expenditures consist principally of payments we will make in connection with strategic collaborations and research and development expenditures  and we will continue to invest in sales and marketing infrastructure 
we have made available to biomarin the ability to draw down on a convertible note up to million beginning july  the convertible note 
the convertible note is convertible based on certain terms and conditions including a change of control provision 
money advanced under the convertible note is convertible into biomarin shares at a strike price equal to the biomarin average closing price for the trading days prior to such advance 
the convertible note matures on the option purchase date in as defined in the securities purchase agreement entered into on may   but may be repaid by biomarin at any time prior to the option purchase date 
as of march   biomarin has not requested any monies to be advanced under the convertible note  and no amounts are outstanding 
in connection with occupancy of the new headquarter office  we ceased use of the prior headquarter office  which consists of approximately  square feet of office space  at an average annual expense of approximately million  under an amended lease agreement that expires in december under sfas  a liability for the costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized when the liability is incurred 
in accordance with sfas  we recorded lease exit costs of approximately million during the three months ended september  consisting of the initial liability of million and accretion expense of million 
these amounts were recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations 
we have not recorded any other costs related to the lease for the prior headquarters 
as of december   approximately million of lease exit costs remain accrued and are expected to be paid by december of which million is classified in other current liabilities and million is classified in other liabilities 
although we no longer use the facilities  the lease exit cost accrual has not been offset by an adjustment for estimated sublease rentals 
after considering sublease market information as well as factors specific to the lease  we concluded it was probable we would be unable to reasonably obtain sublease rentals for the prior headquarters and therefore we would not be subleased for the remaining lease term 
we will continue to monitor the sublease market conditions and reassess the impact on the lease exit cost accrual 
the following is a summary of the activity in the liability for lease exit costs for the year ended december  liability as of amounts charged cash payments cash received liability as of dec

table of contents repurchases of common stock on august   our board of directors approved a stock trading plan to purchase up to million in aggregate value of shares of our class a common stock upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
the number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of the repurchases if any will depend on factors such as the market price of our class a common stock  economic and market conditions  and corporate and regulatory requirements 
the plan terminated on august   as it was scheduled to terminate on the earlier of the first anniversary of the plan or at the time when the aggregate purchase limit was reached 
no shares were repurchased under this plan 
dividends we do not have a dividend policy 
since july  we have paid quarterly cash dividends aggregating approximately million on our common stock 
in addition  on december   we declared a cash dividend of per issued and outstanding share of common stock payable on january  to our stockholders of record at the close of business on january  prior to these dividends  we had not paid a cash dividend on our common stock 
any future determinations to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition  operating results  capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 
fair value measurements as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of january  we determined that we utilize unobservable level inputs in determining the fair value of our auction rate floating security investments  which totaled million at december  these securities were included in long term investments at december  we also utilize unobservable level inputs to value our investment in revance  which totaled million at december   and is included in other assets 
our auction rate floating securities are classified as available for sale securities and are reflected at fair value 
in prior periods  due to the auction process which took place every days for most securities  quoted market prices were readily available  which would qualify as level under sfas no 
however  due to events in credit markets during the first quarter of  the auction events for most of these instruments failed  and  therefore  we determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis as of december  these analyses consider  among other items  the collateralization underlying the security investments  the expected future cash flows  including the final maturity  associated with the securities  and the expectation of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction 
these securities were also compared  when possible  to other observable market data with similar characteristics to the securities held by us 
due to these events  we reclassified these instruments as level during the first quarter of and have recorded an other than temporary impairment loss of million during on our auction rate floating securities  based on our estimate of the fair value of these investments 
our estimate of fair value of our auction rate floating securities was based on market information and estimates determined by our management  which could change in the future based on market conditions 
in november  we entered into a settlement agreement with the broker through which we purchased auction rate floating securities 
the settlement agreement provides us with the right to put an auction rate floating security currently held by us back to the broker beginning on june  at december   we held one auction rate floating security with a par value of million that was subject to the settlement agreement 
we elected the irrevocable fair value option treatment under sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  and adjusted the put option to fair value 
we reclassified this auction rate floating security from available for sale to trading securities as of december   and future changes in fair value related to this investment and the related put right will be recorded in earnings 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we are not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes certain other purchase obligations as discussed below in thousands payments due by period more than more than year and years and less than less than less than more than total year years years years long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases other purchase obligations and commitments total contractual obligations the long term debt consists of our old notes and new notes 
we may redeem some or all of the old notes and new notes at any time on or after june  and june   respectively  at a redemption price  payable in cash  of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any 
holders of the old notes and new notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their old notes on june  and and new notes on june  and  or upon a change in control  as defined in the indenture agreements governing the old notes and new notes  at of the principal amount of the old notes and new notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the repurchase  payable in cash 
as of december   million of the old notes and million of new notes were classified in the more than years and less than years category as the holders of the old notes and new notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their old notes and new notes on june   and june   respectively  each of which is more than years but less than years from the december  balance sheet date 
interest on long term debt includes interest payable on our old notes and new notes  assuming the old notes and new notes will not have any redemptions or conversions into shares of our class a common stock until their respective maturities in and  but does not include any contingent interest 
the amount of interest ultimately paid in future years could change if any of the old notes or new notes are converted or redeemed and or if contingent interest becomes payable if certain future criteria are met 
other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under research and development and consulting contracts 
we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of certain product development and license agreements 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement and timing of these milestones are not fixed or reasonably determinable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and are not included in the above table 
the total amount of potential future milestone payments related to development and license agreements is approximately million 
purchase orders for raw materials  finished goods and other goods and services are not included in the above table 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual 
table of contents obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purpose of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with relatively short timetables 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or finished goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our short term expected requirements 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates related to sales allowances  chargebacks  rebates  returns and other pricing adjustments  depreciation and amortization and other contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors related to each circumstance 
actual results could differ from those estimates based upon future events  which could include  among other risks  changes in the regulations governing the manner in which we sell our products  changes in the health care environment and managed care consumption patterns 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are important in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue from our product sales is recognized pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products has occurred  iii the selling price is both fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical wholesalers who sell directly into the retail channel 
we do not provide any material forms of price protection to our wholesale customers and permit product returns if the product is damaged  or  depending on the customer  if it is returned within six months prior to expiration or up to months after expiration 
our customers consist principally of financially viable wholesalers  and depending on the customer  revenue is recognized based upon shipment fob shipping point or receipt fob destination  net of estimated provisions 
as a general practice  we do not ship product that has less than months until its expiration date 
we also authorize returns for damaged products and credits for expired products in accordance with our returned goods policy and procedures 
the shelf life associated with our products is up to months depending on the product 
the majority of our prescription products have a shelf life of approximately months 
we enter into licensing arrangements with other parties whereby we receive contract revenue based on the terms of the agreement 
the timing of revenue recognition is dependent on the level of our continuing involvement in the manufacture and delivery of licensed products 
if we have continuing involvement  the revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of continuing involvement 
in addition  if our licensing arrangements require no continuing involvement and payments are merely based on the passage of time  we assess such payments for revenue recognition under the collectibility criteria of sab items deducted from gross revenue 
table of contents provisions for estimated product returns  sales discounts and chargebacks are established as a reduction of product sales revenues at the time such revenues are recognized 
provisions for managed care and medicaid rebates and consumer rebate and loyalty programs are established as a reduction of product sales revenues at the later of the date at which revenue is recognized or the date at which the sales incentive is offered in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
in addition  we defer revenue for certain sales of inventory into the distribution channel that are in excess of eight weeks of projected demand 
these deductions from gross revenue are established by us as our best estimate based on historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves  including but not limited to  prescription data  industry trends  competitive developments and estimated inventory in the distribution channel 
our estimates of inventory in the distribution channel are based on inventory information reported to us by our major wholesale customers for which we have inventory management agreements  historical shipment and return information from our accounting records and data on prescriptions filled  which we purchase from ims health  inc  one of the leading providers of prescription based information 
we regularly monitor internal as well as external data from our wholesalers  in order to assess the reasonableness of the information obtained from external sources 
we also utilize projected prescription demand for our products  as well as  our internal information regarding our products 
these deductions from gross revenue are generally reflected either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable through an allowance  as a reserve within current liabilities  as an addition to accrued expenses  or as deferred revenue within current liabilities 
we identify product returns by their manufacturing lot number 
because we manufacture in bulk  lot sizes can be large and  as a result  sales of any individual lot may occur over several periods 
as a result  we are unable to specify if actual returns or credits relate to a sale that occurred in the current period or a prior period  and therefore  we cannot specify how much of the provision recorded relates to sales made in prior periods 
however  we believe the process discussed above  including the tracking of returns by lot  and the availability of other internal and external data allows us to reasonably estimate the level of product returns  as well as estimate the level of expected credits associated with rebates or chargebacks 
our accounting policies for revenue recognition have a significant impact on our reported results and rely on certain estimates that require complex and subjective judgment on the part of our management 
if the levels of product returns  inventory in the distribution channel  cash discounts  chargebacks  managed care and medicaid rebates and consumer rebate and loyalty programs fluctuate significantly and or if our estimates do not adequately reserve for these reductions of gross product revenues  our reported net product revenues could be negatively affected 

table of contents the following table shows the activity of each reserve  associated with the various sales provisions that serve to reduce our accounts receivable balance or increase our accrued expenses or deferred revenue  for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands managed consumer care rebate reserve sales medicaid and for sales deferred discounts chargebacks rebates loyalty returns revenue reserve reserve reserve programs total balance at december  actual provision balance at december  actual provision balance at december  reserve for sales returns we account for returns of product by establishing an allowance based on our estimate of revenues recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned in the future 
we estimate the rate of future product returns for our established products based on our historical experience  the relative risk of return based on expiration date  and other qualitative factors that could impact the level of future product returns  such as competitive developments  product discontinuations and our introduction of similar new products 
historical experience and the other qualitative factors are assessed on a product specific basis as part of our compilation of our estimate of future product returns 
we also estimate inventory in the distribution channel by monitoring inventories held by our distributors  as well as prescription trends to help us assess whether historical rates of return continue to be appropriate given current conditions 
we estimate returns of new products primarily based on our historical acceptance of our new product introductions by our customers and product returns experience of similar products  products that have similar characteristics at various stages of their life cycle  and other available information pertinent to the intended use and marketing of the new product 
changes due to our competitors price movements have not adversely affected us 
we do not provide material pricing incentives to our distributors that are intended to have them assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in their ordinary course of business 
our actual experience and the qualitative factors that we use to determine the necessary accrual for future product returns are susceptible to change based on unforeseen events and uncertainties 
we assess the trends that could affect our estimates and make changes to the accrual quarterly when it appears product returns may differ from our original estimates 
the provision for product returns was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for product returns was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the provision as a percentage of gross product sales and the reserve was primarily related to a reduction in 
table of contents product returns experienced during and lower levels of inventory in the distribution channel at december  if the amount of our estimated quarterly returns increased by percent  our sales returns reserve at december  would increase by approximately million and corresponding revenue would decrease by the same amount 
conversely  if the amount of our estimated quarterly returns decreased by percent  our sales returns reserve at december  would decrease by approximately million and corresponding revenue would increase by the same amount 
we consider the sensitivity analysis of a percent variance between estimated and actual sales returns to be representative of the range of other outcomes that we are reasonably likely to experience in estimating our sales returns reserves 
for newly launched products  if the returns reserve percentage increased by one percentage point  our sales return reserve at december  would increase by approximately million and corresponding revenue would decrease by the same amount 
conversely  if the returns reserve percentage decreased by one percentage point  our sales returns reserve at december  would have decreased by approximately million and corresponding revenue would increase by the same amount 
we also defer the recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue for certain sales of inventory into the distribution channel that are in excess of eight weeks of projected demand 
the distribution channel s market demand requirement is estimated based on inventory information reported to us by our major wholesale customers for which we have inventory management agreements  who make up a significant majority of our total sales of inventory into the distribution channel 
no adjustment is made for those customers who do not provide inventory information to us 
deferred product revenue net of the related cost of revenue associated with estimated excess inventory at wholesalers was approximately million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
sales discounts we offer cash discounts to our customers as an incentive for prompt payment  generally approximately of the sales price 
we account for cash discounts by establishing an allowance reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts expected to be taken by the customers 
we consider payment performance and adjust the allowance to reflect actual experience and our current expectations about future activity 
the provision for cash discounts was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for cash discounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in the provision was due to an increase in gross product sales 
the balance in the reserve for sales discounts at the end of the fiscal year is related to the amount of accounts receivable that is outstanding at that date that is still eligible for the cash discounts to be taken by the customers 
the fluctuations in the reserve for sales discounts between periods are normally reflective of increases or decreases in the related eligible outstanding accounts receivable amounts at the comparable dates 
contract chargebacks we have agreements for contract pricing with several entities  whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price 
these parties purchase products through wholesalers at the lower contract price  and the wholesalers charge the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contract price back to us 
we account for chargebacks by establishing an allowance reducing accounts receivable based on our estimate of chargeback claims attributable to a sale 
we determine our estimate of chargebacks based on historical experience and changes to current contract prices 
we also consider our claim processing lag time  and adjust the allowance periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience 
although we record an allowance for estimated chargebacks at the time we record the sale typically when we ship the product  the actual chargeback related to that sale is not processed until the entities purchase the product from the wholesaler 
we continually monitor our historical experience and current pricing trends to ensure the liability for future chargebacks is fairly stated 

table of contents the provision for contract chargebacks was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for contract chargebacks was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in the provision and the reserve was due to an increase in the number of pricing contracts in place during the comparable periods 
managed care and medicaid rebates rebates are contractual discounts offered to government programs and private health plans that are eligible for such discounts at the time prescriptions are dispensed  subject to various conditions 
we record provisions for rebates based on factors such as timing and terms of plans under contract  time to process rebates  product pricing  sales volumes  amount of inventory in the distribution channel  and prescription trends 
we continually monitor historical payment rates and actual claim data to ensure the liability is fairly stated 
the provision for managed care and medicaid rebates was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for managed care and medicaid rebates was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in the provision was primarily due to an increase in the number of pricing contracts in place during the comparable periods related to solodyn 
the increase in the reserve is due to an increase in the amount of rebates outstanding at the comparable dates  due to the increase in the number of solodyn pricing contracts in place 
consumer rebates and loyalty programs we offer consumer rebates on many of our products and we have consumer loyalty programs 
we generally account for these programs by establishing an accrual based on our estimate of the rebate and loyalty incentives attributable to a sale 
we generally base our estimates for the accrual of these items on historical experience and other relevant factors 
we adjust our accruals periodically throughout each quarter based on actual experience and changes in other factors  if any  to ensure the balance is fairly stated 
the provision for consumer rebates and loyalty programs was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for consumer rebates and loyalty programs was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in the provision and the reserve was primarily due to new consumer rebate programs initiated during related to our solodyn  restylane and perlane products 
if our estimates of rebate redemption rates or average rebate amounts for our consumer rebate programs changed by percent  or our estimates of eligible procedures completed related to our customer loyalty programs were to change by percent  our reserve for these items would be impacted by approximately million and corresponding revenue would be impacted by the same amount 
we consider the sensitivity analysis of a percent variance in our estimated rebate redemption rates and average rebate amounts to be representative of the range of other outcomes that we are reasonably likely to experience in estimating our reserve for consumer rebates and loyalty programs 
use of information from external sources we use information from external sources to estimate our significant items deducted from gross revenues 
our estimates of inventory in the distribution channel are based on historical shipment and return information from our accounting records and data on prescriptions filled  which we purchase from ims health  inc  one of the leading providers of prescription based information 
we regularly monitor internal data as well as external data from our wholesalers  in order to assess the reasonableness of the information obtained from external sources 
we also utilize projected prescription demand for our products  as well as  written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and our internal information 
we use the information from ims health  inc to project the prescription demand for our products 
our estimates are subject to inherent limitations pertaining to reliance on third party information  as certain third party information is itself in the form of estimates 

table of contents use of estimates in reserves we believe that our allowances and accruals for items that are deducted from gross revenues are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
it is possible  however  that other parties applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different allowance and accrual amounts for items that are deducted from gross revenues 
additionally  changes in actual experience or changes in other qualitative factors could cause our allowances and accruals to fluctuate  particularly with newly launched products 
we review the rates and amounts in our allowance and accrual estimates on a quarterly basis 
if future estimated rates and amounts are significantly greater than those reflected in our recorded reserves  the resulting adjustments to those reserves would decrease our reported net revenues  conversely  if actual returns  rebates and chargebacks are significantly less than those reflected in our recorded reserves  the resulting adjustments to those reserves would increase our reported net revenues 
if we changed our assumptions and estimates  our related reserves would change  which would impact the net revenues we report 
share based compensation as part of our adoption of sfas no 
r as of july   we were required to recognize the fair value of share based compensation awards as an expense 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the date of grant requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
option pricing models  including the black scholes model  also require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
we use a blend of historical and implied volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe this is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility 
increasing the weighted average volatility by percent from percent to percent would have increased the fair value of stock options granted in to per share 
conversely  decreasing the weighted average volatility by percent from percent to percent would have decreased the fair value of stock options granted in to per share 
the expected life of the awards is based on historical experience of awards with similar characteristics 
stock option awards granted during have a stated term of years  and the weighted average expected life of the awards was determined to be years 
decreasing the weighted average expected life by years from years to years would have decreased the fair value of stock options granted in to per share 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of future dividend payouts 
the fair value of our restricted stock grants is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant discounted for expected future dividends 
sfas no 
r requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate may have a significant effect on share based compensation  as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after july  is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
the effect of forfeiture adjustments in the first quarter of was immaterial 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what was recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
future stock based compensation expense and unearned stock based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 

table of contents our estimates of these important assumptions are based on historical data and judgment regarding market trends and factors 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors  we may be required to record additional stock based compensation expense or income tax expense  which could be material to our results of operations 
inventory inventory costs associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval are capitalized if we believe there is probable future commercial use and future economic benefit 
if future commercial use and future economic benefit are not considered probable  then costs associated with pre launch inventory that has not yet received regulatory approval are expensed as research and development expense during the period the costs are incurred 
we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory if the probability of future commercial use and future economic benefit changes due to denial or delay of regulatory approval  a delay in commercialization  or other factors 
conversely  our gross margins could be favorably impacted if previously expensed pre approval inventory becomes available and is used for commercial sale 
as of december   there were million of costs capitalized into inventory for products that have not yet received regulatory approval 
we believe that it is probable that these products will receive regulatory approval and future revenues that exceed costs will be generated from the sale of the inventory 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future net cash flows 
if an asset carrying value is not recoverable through the related cash flows  the asset is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the asset grouping s carrying amount and its fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated  and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets  we accelerate the rate of amortization charges in order to fully amortize the assets over their new shorter useful lives 
during  we did not recognize an impairment charge as a result of our review of long lived assets 
during and  impairment charges of million and million  respectively  were recognized related to our review of long lived assets 
during  the remaining useful life of the intangible asset that was deemed to be impaired was reduced 
during  the remaining useful lives of two of the intangible assets that were deemed to be impaired were reduced 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for  and or accelerate amortization of  long lived assets 
income taxes income taxes are determined using an annual effective tax rate  which generally differs from the us federal statutory rate  primarily because of state and local income taxes  enhanced charitable contribution deductions for inventory  tax credits available in the us  the treatment of certain share based payments under sfas r that are not designed to normally result in tax deductions  various expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes  and differences in tax rates in certain non us jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuations during the year as new information is obtained which may affect the assumptions we use to estimate our annual effective tax rate  including factors such as our mix of pre tax earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  changes in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  reserves for tax audit issues and settlements  utilization of tax credits and changes in tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct operations 
we recognize tax benefits in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
under fin  tax benefits are recognized only if the tax position is 
table of contents more likely than not of being sustained 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities  along with net operating losses and credit carryforwards 
we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying values to amounts that management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
based on our historical pre tax earnings  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of substantially all of the existing net deferred tax assets at december  we believe the existing net deductible temporary differences will reverse during periods in which we generate net taxable income  however  there can be no assurance that we will generate any earnings or any specific level of continuing earnings in future years 
certain tax planning or other strategies could be implemented  if necessary  to supplement income from operations to fully realize recorded tax benefits 
the company has an option to acquire revance or license revance s product that is under development 
through december   we have recorded million of charges related to the reduction in the carrying value of the revance investment 
the reduction in the carrying value of the revance investment is currently an unrealized loss for tax purposes 
we will not be able to determine the character of the loss until we exercise or fail to exercise our option 
a realized loss characterized as a capital loss can only be utilized to offset capital gains 
we have recorded a million valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with this unrealized tax loss in order to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset to  which is the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
research and development costs and accounting for strategic collaborations all research and development costs  including payments related to products under development and research consulting agreements  are expensed as incurred 
we may continue to make non refundable payments to third parties for new technologies and for new technologies and research and development work that has been completed 
these payments may be expensed at the time of payment depending on the nature of the payment made 
our policy on accounting for costs of strategic collaborations determines the timing of our recognition of certain development costs 
in addition  this policy determines whether the cost is classified as development expense or capitalized as an asset 
we are required to form judgments with respect to the commercial status of such products in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
for example  when we acquire certain products for which there is already an anda or nda approval related directly to the product  and there is net realizable value based on projected sales for these products  we capitalize the amount paid as an intangible asset 
in addition  if we acquire product rights which are in the development phase and as to which we have no assurance that the third party will successfully complete its development milestones  we expense such payments 
legal contingencies we record contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against us  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose material contingent liabilities  when there is a reasonable possibility  that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
in addition to the matters disclosed in item legal proceedings  we are party to ordinary and routine litigation incidental to our business 
we do not expect the outcome of any pending litigation to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings

r  business combinations  which replaces sfas no 
and establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any controlling interest 
it also established principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas no 
r provides for the following changes from sfas no 
an acquirer will record all assets and liabilities of acquired business  including goodwill  at fair value  regardless of the level of interest acquired  certain contingent assets and liabilities acquired will be recognized at fair value at the acquisition date  contingent consideration will be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date with changes in fair value to be recognized in earnings  acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs will be expensed as incurred rather than treated as part of the cost of the acquisition and included in the amount recorded for assets acquired  reversals of valuation allowances related to acquired deferred tax assets and changes to acquired income tax uncertainties will be recognized in earnings  and when making adjustments to finalize initial accounting  acquirers will revise any previously issued post acquisition financial information in future financial statements to reflect any adjustments as if they occurred on the acquisition date 
sfas no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the impact of sfas no

 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas no 
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest  or minority interest  as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the statement of operations 
sfas no 
clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains it controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas no

in december  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf  accounting for collaborative agreements 
eitf prohibits companies from applying the equity method of accounting to activities performed outside a separate legal entity by a virtual joint venture 
instead  revenues and costs incurred with third parties in connection with the collaborative arrangement should be presented gross or net by the collaborators based on the criteria in eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and other applicable accounting literature 
the consensus should be applied to collaborative arrangements in existence at the date of adoption using a modified retrospective method that requires reclassification in all periods presented for those arrangements still in effect at the transition date  unless that application is impracticable

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   million of our cash equivalent investments are in money market securities that are reflected as cash equivalents  because all maturities are within days 
included in money market securities are commercial paper  federal agency discount notes and money market funds 
our interest rate risk with respect to these investments is limited due to the short term duration of these arrangements and the yields earned  which approximate current interest rates 
our policy for our short term and long term investments is to establish a high quality portfolio that preserves principal  meets liquidity needs  avoids inappropriate concentrations and delivers an appropriate yield in relationship to our investment guidelines and market conditions 
our investment portfolio  consisting of fixed income securities that we hold on an available for sale basis  was approximately million as of december   million as of december  and million as of december  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates increase 
as of december   our short term investments included auction rate floating securities with a fair value of million 
our auction rate floating securities are debt instruments with a long term maturity and with an interest rate that is reset in short intervals through auctions 
the negative conditions in the credit markets during have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings  including their holdings of auction rate floating securities 
as a result  these affected auction rate floating securities are now considered illiquid  and we could be required to hold them until they are redeemed by the holder at maturity 
we may not be able to liquidate the securities until a future auction on these investments is successful 
as a result of the lack of liquidity of these investments  we recorded an other than temporary impairment loss of million during on our auction rate floating securities 

table of contents the following table provides information about our available for sale and trading securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates

we have not entered into derivative financial instruments 
we have minimal operations outside of the united states and  accordingly  we have not been susceptible to significant risk from changes in foreign currencies 
during the normal course of business we could be subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations  as we discussed above  and collectibility of accounts receivable 
we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future
