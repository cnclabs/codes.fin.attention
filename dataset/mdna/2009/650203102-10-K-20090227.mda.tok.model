significant judgment is involved in determining when a decline in fair value is other than temporary 
the factors considered by management include  but are not limited to adverse changes in management s assessment of the factors used to determine that a security was not other than temporarily impaired could lead to additional impairment charges 
conditions affecting a security that we determined to be temporary could become other than temporary and warrant an impairment charge 
additionally  a security that had no apparent risk could be affected by a sudden or acute market condition and necessitate an impairment charge 
the company has eleven securities that are currently or more below book value that are not considered other than temporarily impaired 
at december   these securities have a fair value of million compared to a book value of million

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets critical estimates judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions we evaluate goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable 
we complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses  considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm  as appropriate 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill using the methodology described herein  and determined there was no impairment 
through year end  no events or circumstances subsequent to the annual testing date indicate that the carrying value of the company s goodwill may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at december   was million and million  respectively 
for further discussion on goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  see the goodwill and intangible assets section on page of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as well as note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including estimated future cash flows  our stock price in relation to book value and discount rates and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
management has evaluated the effect of lowering the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by and determined that no impairment of goodwill would have been recognized under this evaluation 
allowance for loan losses critical estimates judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions it is the policy of newalliance to maintain an allowance for loan losses that equals management s best estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date 
management follows a guiding principle that the level of the reserve should be directionally consistent with asset quality indicators 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is determined based upon a detailed evaluation of the portfolio and sub portfolios through a process which considers numerous factors  including levels and direction of delinquencies  historical charge offs  non performing loans and assets  risk ratings  estimated credit losses using both internal and external portfolio reviews  current economic and market conditions  concentrations  portfolio volume and mix  changes in underwriting  experience of staff  and historical loss rates over the business cycle 
the allowance for loan losses is reviewed and approved by the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
for further discussion on the allowance for loan losses  see the allowance for loan losses section on pages of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as well as note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by analyzing and estimating losses inherent in the portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to use historical information as well as current economic data to make judgments on the adequacy of the allowance 
as the allowance is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  it may impact the portfolio in a way currently unforeseen 
adverse changes in management s assessment of the factors used to determine the allowance for loan losses could lead to additional provisions 
actual loan losses could differ materially from management s estimates if actual losses and conditions differ significantly from the assumptions utilized 
these factors and conditions include general economic conditions within newalliance s market  trends within industries  real estate and other collateral values  interest rates and the financial condition of the individual borrower 
while management believes that it has established adequate specific and general allowances for probable losses on loans  there can be no assurance that the regulators  in reviewing the company s loan portfolio  will not request an increase in the allowance for losses  thereby negatively affecting the company s financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities critical estimates judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions management uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s asset and liabilities 
the realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable income and the existence of prior years taxable income  to which carry back refund claims could be made 
a valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to be unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made 
each quarter  we reevaluate our estimate related to the valuation allowance  including our assumptions about future profitability 
at december  and december   our valuation allowance was million and million  respectively 
as a result of reviews of the factors discussed above related to the adequacy of the valuation allowance  our income tax expense for the year ended december  included an increase in the valuation allowance attributable to capital losses of  the increase was mainly due to additional capital losses incurred in for further discussion on our deferred taxes and valuation allowance  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
some judgments are subjective and involve estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in determining the valuation allowance  we use historical and forecasted future operating results  based upon approved business plans  including a review of the eligible carryforward periods  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
management believes that the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period 
for example  tax law changes or variances in future projected operating performance could result in a change in the valuation allowance 
should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those used by management  the actual realization of net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements 
if we were not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our income taxes 
management believes that the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is adequate and reasonable 
however  if future projected profitability were to decline by  the valuation allowance would need to be increased by an additional  to  tax contingencies critical estimates judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions we regularly face challenges from domestic tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  we record reserves for probable exposures 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 
our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 
our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law  entry into new tax jurisdictions  the level of earnings and the results of tax audits 
we believe that our tax reserves reflect the probable outcomes of known contingencies 
although we think that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results may differ  which could be material to our financial statements 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves  our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate or through goodwill in the period of resolution 
pension and other post retirement benefits critical estimates judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions pension costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
management uses key assumptions that include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  benefits earned  interest costs  mortality rates  increases in compensation  and other factors 
the two most critical assumptions estimated return on plan assets and the discount rate are important elements of plan expense and asset liability measurements 
these critical assumptions are evaluated at least annually on a plan basis 
other assumptions are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect actual experience and expectations for the future 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors  and in accordance with us gaap the impact of these differences is accumulated and amortized over future periods 
the discount rate assumptions used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference to published high quality bond indices  as well as certain yield curves 
the company used the citigroup pension liability index as a benchmark 
a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases pension expense 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on current and expected asset allocations  as well as the long term historical risks and returns with each asset class within the plan portfolio 
a lower expected rate of return on plan assets increases pension costs 
for further discussion on pension and other post retirement benefits  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
to reflect market interest rate conditions in calculating the projected benefit obligation  the pension discount rate was decreased from at september  to at december   while the postretirement discount rate remained at at each of these periods 
an expected rate of return of and was utilized at december  and september   respectively 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect future pension or other postretirement obligations and expense 
continued volatility in pension expense is expected as assumed investment returns vary from actual 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase annual pension expense by  while an increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by  a basis point decrease or increase in the expected return on assets would increase or decrease annual pension expense  respectively  by operating results table summary income statements year ended december  change dollars in thousands  except per share data amount percent amount percent net interest income     provision for loan losses    non interest income     operating expenses     merger related charges    income before income taxes     income tax expense     net income basic and diluted earnings per share earnings summary comparison of and in a year that had unprecedented turmoil in the economy and financial markets  newalliance improved the core performance of the company and was able to mitigate the steep declines in market interest rates with new growth and avoid vast losses in its loan and investment securities portfolios due to historically sound credit practices 
as shown in table  net income was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the year ended december  the largest single component for this year over year increase resulted from the securities restructuring in for which a net loss of million million  net of tax was recorded 
this transaction is described in detail in the comparison shown below 
excluding the restructuring charge  net income increased million from the prior year period 
the primary driver of this year over year increase was the increase in net interest income of million largely due to the reduction of deposit costs and organic growth in the loan portfolio  partially offset by declines in average loan yields and increased borrowings 
mostly offsetting the increase in net interest income was an increase in the provision for loan losses of million due to the increase in nonperforming loans and to reflect the rising risk inherent in the loan portfolio owing to the current economic environment  an increase in operating interest expenses of million largely due to higher salaries and employee benefits expense including payment of an executive severance and higher bonus accruals as well as increased outside services expense for consulting 
income tax expense also increased  primarily attributable to higher pre tax income 
comparison of and net income decreased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparative period in during the year ended december   newalliance sold approximately million of available for sale securities and realized net losses totaling million 
the sale was undertaken to reduce the company s exposure to fixed rate assets as well as to increase the yield on the portfolio  thereby providing a prospective improvement in the net interest margin 
newalliance replaced substantially all of the assets sold with higher yielding agency hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and expects to recover the million loss through higher earnings from july through the end of as a result of this restructuring  the company reported significantly lower net income for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in for the year ended december   operating expenses were higher than the year ended due mostly to increased salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expenses and amortization of identifiable intangible assets  primarily resulting from the westbank and cimi acquisitions 
the provision for loan losses also increased in over as a result of growth in the loan portfolio  charge offs incurred during the year and an increase in non accrual loans 
net interest income increased by million for the year ended december  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio as a result of the westbank acquisition  residential loan purchases and originations 
net interest income for the year ended december  was hampered by the shape of the yield curve  declining spreads and a decline in net interest earning assets due to acquisitions  share buybacks and dividends paid 
the impact to the net interest margin was partially offset by the basis point improvement in the average yield earned on investment securities due in part to the restructuring of the investment portfolio 
the decrease to income tax expense of million was due to lower pretax earnings as a result of the million loss incurred on the restructuring of the investment portfolio 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the charitable contribution carryforward 
average balances  interest and average yields cost table below sets forth certain information concerning average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and their associated yields or rates for the periods indicated 
the average yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expenses by the average balances of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown and reflect annualized yields and costs 
average balances are computed using daily balances 
yields and amounts earned include loan fees and fair value adjustments related to acquired loans 
loans held for sale and nonaccrual loans have been included in interest earning assets for purposes of these computations 
interest on nonaccrual loans has been included only to the extent reflected in the consolidated statements of income

net interest margin is the difference between the income on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing funds as a percentage of earning assets 
during  the yield curve returned to a more normal  upward sloping shape 
since the beginning of the year  the federal reserve board frb lowered the target federal funds rate seven times  for a total decrease of basis points from to between and 
decreases of basis points and basis points occurred during the first and second quarters of  respectively  while the frb left the overnight federal funds target rate unchanged at for the quarter ending september  during the fourth quarter of the frb reduced the target federal funds rate by basis points 
comparison of and as shown in table  net interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increase is due to a basis point increase in the net interest margin to at december  from for the same period a year ago  primarily due to the significant reduction in costs associated with higher priced certificate of deposit accounts  growth in the loan portfolio and the investment portfolio restructuring in  partially offset by the effect of the decline in yield on adjustable and variable rate commercial and consumer loans 
interest income decreased million from the year ended december  and was comprised of a million decrease due to rate  offset by a million increase due to volume 
the decline due to rate was primarily caused by the significant rate cuts enacted by the frb in as average yields earned on loans and short term investments decreased basis points and basis points  respectively and the resulting decline in dividend yields on equity securities  mainly federal home loan bank of boston stock 
loan yields have also been negatively impacted by an increase in nonperforming loans 
slightly offsetting these rate declines was an increase in the average yield earned on the securities portfolio as a result of the restructuring 
strong loan growth  however  made the most substantial difference in mitigating the effects of the rate cuts as average loan balances increased million  or from the prior year 
three of the four loan categories experienced increases in average balances  with the residential real estate loan portfolio as the main driver of the growth 
the increase in average balances was due to increased loan originations as the company  with ready liquidity and capital  was able to take advantage of the pricing opportunities in our lending area due to the sustained dislocations in the credit market 
we expect this trend to continue in the near term  however  as other banks regain strength after receiving infusions of capital from the eesa and begin lending again  competition will likely increase 
the federal home loan bank of boston issued a letter in december to member banks regarding its focus on preserving capital in response to ongoing market volatility 
they have adopted a revised retained earnings target and quarterly dividend payout restrictions and expect that these actions will result in lower dividends until the target is achieved  though there can be no assurance of a specific dividend level 
the company is anticipating a decline in the dividend yield on its holdings of federal home loan bank of boston stock in for the year ended december  as compared to  the company experienced a significant reduction in its cost of funds in the amount of million as a shift in the mix of interest bearing liabilities reduced the average rate paid by basis points and helped to improve the net interest spread by basis points 
the company s continuing strategy has been to bring down deposit costs while being mindful of competitor pricing and focusing on growth of core deposits 
the shift was away from higher costing time deposits as well as from money market and now deposits and into savings deposits 
the free savings product  with an attractive interest rate  has been very successful for the company 
although the average rate paid on savings deposits increased by basis points from the prior year  the average rate paid on all interest bearing deposits declined a net basis points 
for the year ended december   total average interest bearing deposits declined million  however  average interest bearing core deposits increased million at a much lower rate 
partially offsetting the million decline in deposit interest expense was an increase in expense on borrowings of million  principally due to an increase of million in the average balance of fhlb advances and other borrowings 
fhlb advances were used to fund loan growth and to counter deposit outflows that occurred primarily in the first quarter of comparison of and net interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from december  the year over year increase in net interest income was primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio  an improved asset liability mix and an increase in investment interest income as a result of the investment portfolio restructuring 
these increases during the year were somewhat masked by the slope of the yield curve  and the average rates paid  particularly on time deposits  due to intense deposit competition 
throughout  the net interest margin was also compressed by a reduction in the profitability of new loans and deposits  as competitive pressures reduced the profit margin on new business 
both the net interest rate spread and the net interest margin declined basis points to and  respectively from levels 
interest and dividend income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest income was primarily driven by loans due to an increase in the average balances of million 
while all loan categories experienced increases in average balances and average yields  the residential and commercial real estate loan portfolios were the drivers of growth 
the increases in average balances are due to the acquisition of westbank  the company s continued strategy of purchasing residential mortgages in the secondary market throughout most of and increased organic loan originations 
the loan portfolio volume increase accounted for approximately million of the increase in interest income 
the remaining increase in interest income was primarily due to the higher yield earned on investment securities as a result of the restructuring of the available for sale portfolio 
the cost of funds for the year ended december  increased million  or to million compared to the prior year period 
the average rate on interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to from 
the overall increase in interest expense was primarily due to increases in interest expense on time deposits and fhlb advances and other borrowings of million and million  respectively 
the increase in interest expense on time deposits was due to a basis point increase in the average rate on these deposits coupled with an average balance increase of million 
the time deposit balances acquired from westbank were approximately million 
the basis point increase in the average rate was due to market interest rate increases and the company s offering of promotional rates in a challenging market to customers who either had or established a checking relationship with the bank 
the increase in interest expense of million on fhlb advances and other borrowings was predominately due to an increase in the average balance of million 
borrowings were used to fund the company s organic loan growth  purchases of residential mortgages and investment securities and offset deposit outflow 
there was also a basis point increase in the average rate paid on these borrowings due to increases in market interest rates 
increasing market interest rates  balances acquired from westbank and ongoing checking and savings promotions were the primary factors for the higher interest expense in the other deposit categories  but were partially offset by a decline in the average balances of money market deposits

the provision for loan losses is charged against earnings in order to maintain an allowance for loan losses that reflects management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
management performs a monthly review of the loan portfolio  and based on this review determines the level of the provision necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses allowance 
management recorded a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  the primary factors that influenced management s decision to record this provision was growth in the loan portfolio and increasing trends in a delinquencies b net charge offs and c nonperforming loans 
net charge offs increased to million for the year and non performing loans increased million 
the increase in nonperforming loans was predominantly in the residential portfolio and in construction loans to commercial developers of residential condominiums due to the economic downturn and continued softening in the real estate market which has caused an increase in residential inventory levels and declines in home prices 
future provisions for loan losses may be deemed necessary if economic conditions do not improve or continue to deteriorate 
a provision for loan losses of million and  was recorded for the years ended december  and  respectively

the principal categories of non interest income are shown in table comparison of and as displayed in table  non interest income increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in non interest income was primarily attributable to the investment portfolio restructuring that resulted in a net loss recorded in of million 
excluding the investment restructuring  non interest income declined million primarily due to decreases in depositor service charges  loan and servicing income  bank owned life insurance boli and other income  partially offset by increases in net gain loss on securities and investment management  brokerage and insurance fees 
depositor service charges decreased due to a decline in overdraft fees  point of sale fees and inactive and dormant account fees 
the company eliminated debit card point of sale  inactive and dormant account service charges during the first quarter of for promotional and competitive reasons  while overdraft fees declined due to volume 
these decreases were partially offset by increased check card revenue resulting from expanded card usage due in part to a rewards program initiated in  which offers cash rewards to customers who use their check card and an increase in merchant services income 
loan and servicing income declined largely due to a write down on the valuation of the bank s mortgage servicing asset and the decrease in commercial real estate prepayment fees and letter of credit fees 
investment management  brokerage and insurance fees increased mainly due to the sales of fixed annuity products resulting from a favorable rate environment for these products 
an increase in the number of sales personnel and increased marketing efforts have contributed to the increased trading activity and the sales of investment products 
boli income decreased due to a decline in the average yield earned as a result of current market interest rates 
net gain on securities increased million primarily due to the restructuring in which resulted in a total charge of million 
excluding the restructuring  net gain on securities increased million due to gains recorded on the sale of mortgage backed securities 
these securities were sold at a premium and were sold in order to reduce prepayment and duration risk 
partially offsetting the gain on mortgage backed securities were other than temporary impairment charges of million and losses recorded on the sale of bank stocks in the second quarter of the impairment charges primarily relate to an investment in a trust preferred equity security issued by a regional bank in the amount of million and for preferred equity securities is sued by freddie mac and lehman brothers in the amounts of  and  respectively  due to their sudden loss in market value 
the company does not expect the financial position of the regional bank or the current price of its security to improve meaningfully over the near term and also considered its market price to reflect enhanced risk in the timely realization of cashflows and it was  therefore  written down to market value through the income statement 
the lehman brothers preferred equity security was deemed impaired as a result of lehman brothers declaration of chapter bankruptcy in september the freddie mac preferred equity security was deemed impaired as a result of freddie mac being placed in conservatorship by the us treasury  frb and the federal housing finance agency 
additionally  dividends were halted on existing common and preferred securities and the us treasury invested billion in the form of senior preferred equity  which has priority over the company s preferred equity securities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
other income decreased mainly as a result of a prior year net gain on limited partnerships which resulted from the sale of an underlying investment compared to a net loss on limited partnerships in the current year period and a decrease in amounts earned on the outstanding balances of bank checks processed by a third party vendor due to the decline in market interest rates

excluding the restructuring charges  non interest income increased million and was primarily due to increases in depositor service charges  bank owned life insurance  investment management  brokerage and insurance fees and net gain on securities 
the increase in depositor service charges was mainly the result of increases in overdraft  check card  and atm fees which was primarily due to additional volume created by the acquisition of westbank and an increase in the per item fee 
in addition  there was an increase in merchant services income primarily due to the additional merchants  increased volume and pricing concessions negotiated by the company and the vendor 
boli increased due to having a full year of income generated from the purchase of million of life insurance coverage during the third quarter of  million acquired from westbank and an increase in the average yield earned 
the increase in investment management  brokerage insurance fees was primarily due to the acquisition of cimi  additional and more experienced financial advisors on staff and more favorable market conditions as compared to the prior year  which have all boosted trading activity and higher sales of investment and insurance products 
excluding the securities restructuring  there were increased gains on securities as a result of gains on sales of us agency securities due to excess collateral  mortgage backed securities for liquidity purposes  several utility stocks due to low dividend yields  and the call of trust preferred securities  partially offset by the loss on the sale of a bank stock as a result of the market downturn in the financial sector and a write down on two perpetual preferred securities due to a determination that these securities were other than temporarily impaired

the main drivers of the increase were salaries and employee benefits and outside services  partially offset by decreases in amortization of identifiable intangible assets  merger related charges  and advertising  public relations and sponsorships 
salaries and employee benefits increased as a result of a severance recorded in the first quarter of for an executive who is no longer with the company b increased employee incentive accruals  including incentive payouts due to the increased sales of investment products c general merit increases d a decrease in capitalized salaries primarily due to the decline in commercial loan originations and e increased expense on the company s supplemental executive retirement plan compared to the twelve months ended december  due to changes in assumptions 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in charges associated with the long term compensation plan ltcp for executives that are no longer with the company and a decrease in esop expense due to the decline in the company s average year to date stock price 
it is anticipated that the company will have a decrease of approximately million in stock option expense in as the majority of options granted to date became fully vested on december  however  under the terms of the ltcp  additional options are likely to be granted which would necessitate the continued expensing of options in future periods 
also in  the company is anticipating an increase of approximately million in pension benefit expense primarily due to the year over year decline of approximately million in value of its pension assets and changes in assumptions 
outside services increased due to consulting costs associated with the implementation of a performance optimization project in an effort to enhance the overall effectiveness and revenue performance of the company 
during consulting costs for this project were approximately million  and expenses associated with this project are expected to continue in  but at a lower level 
outside services also increased due to charges incurred for outsourcing general internal audit work  legal and consulting costs related to human resources  partially offset by a decline in data processing expenses 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets decreased due to using an accelerated method of amortization for core deposit intangibles which results in a higher level of expense in earlier periods and amortization of non compete agreements due to the expiration of all agreements in the third quarter of conversion and merger related charges decreased mainly due to charges for legal  consulting  advertising and data processing expense associated with the westbank acquisition that occurred in as part of the emergency economic stabilization act of signed into law on october   fdic deposit insurance temporarily increased from  to  per depositor through december  beginning in january  premiums due to the fdic for deposit insurance will be increasing uniformly by seven basis points as a result of recent failed institutions which have resulted in losses to the fdic deposit insurance fund and in anticipation of institutions failing in the future 
for the first quarter of  the assessment rate for the bank has increased to twelve basis points  compared to five basis points in the assessment rate for the remainder of has not yet been finalized by the fdic  however  the cost associated with the assessment rate increase is expected to have a significant impact on the bank s insurance premium expense 
also  negatively impacting the bank s insurance premium expense in is the exhaustion of its one time credit established by the federal deposit insurance reform act of this credit covered all of the company s fdic assessment expense and of its expense for the year ended december  the assessment credit was largely exhausted at year end comparison of and as displayed in table  non interest expense increased million to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the same period a year ago 
the main drivers of the increase were salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  advertising  public relations  and sponsorships  amortization of identifiable intangible assets and other non interest expense 
the increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily attributable to the acquisition of westbank and higher pension and medical benefit costs  partially offset by lower accruals for incentive payouts and decreases in restricted stock and option expense due to the timing of executive and director retirements and severance payments in for an executive who is no longer with the company 
pension costs increased primarily due to a greater number of employees in the plan and changes in the actuarial assumptions used to calculate net periodic benefit cost 
occupancy expense increased due to the increased branch network as a result of the westbank acquisition and the opening of a de novo office in the fourth quarter of electricity expense also served to increase the company s occupancy expenses due to the rate increases imposed by utility companies throughout the state of connecticut as well as a non recurring charge of  related to the disposition of excess space 
advertising  public relations  and sponsorships increased due to various media advertising and bonus campaigns to promote free savings and home equity products  to enhance business banking relationships and to maintain market share 
the increase in amortization of intangibles was primarily due to new amortization of customer intangibles recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of westbank  partially offset by fewer non compete agreements remaining from prior acquisitions 
the amortization of the non compete agreements concluded in the third quarter of other expense increased due primarily to the added branch locations which increased office supplies  telephones and postage expenses 
conversion and merger related charges decreased due to various charges recorded in the fourth quarter of for the westbank acquisition that included legal fees  consulting and disclosure and compliance mailings 
income tax expense income tax expense for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the effective tax rates for the years ended  and were  and respectively 
the change in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  was primarily due to the million increase in the valuation allowance required for the contribution carryforward in and the reduction of  of unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions of prior years resulting from the settlement of the irs audit in the first quarter of the change in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  was primarily due to the million increase in the valuation allowance required for the contribution carryforward offset partially by investments in bank owned life insurance made by the company that produce tax exempt income 
newalliance continually monitors and evaluates the potential impact of current events and circumstances on the estimates used in the analysis of its income tax positions  and accordingly  newalliance s effective tax rate may fluctuate in the future 
newalliance evaluates its income tax positions based on tax laws and appropriate regulations and financial reporting considerations  and records adjustments as appropriate 
this evaluation takes into consideration the status of current taxing authorities examinations of newalliance s tax returns and recent positions taken by the taxing authorities on similar transactions  if any 
accordingly  the results of these examinations may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions taken by the company 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources financial condition summary from december  to december   total assets increased approximately million mainly due to an increase in loans  partially offset by a decline in investment securities 
liabilities increased million due mainly to increases in deposits 
stockholders equity decreased million to billion due primarily to treasury shares acquired  dividends declared and the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income 
accumulated other comprehensive income declined primarily due to the sfas no 
adjustment to recognize the year over year change in the funded position of the company s pension plans 
these decreases to stockholders equity were partially offset by net income of million earned for the twelve months ended december  investment securities the company maintains an investment securities portfolio that is primarily structured to provide a source of liquidity for operating needs  to generate interest income and to provide a means to balance interest rate sensitivity 
the securities portfolio is managed in accordance with regulatory guidelines and established internal corporate investment policies

this is a decrease of million from billion at december  the decrease was mainly the result of using cash flows from available for sale and held to maturity mortgage backed securities primarily to fund loan growth  partially offset by purchases of mortgage backed securities using funds borrowed from the federal home loan bank of boston 
the available for sale and held to maturity securities portfolio are primarily composed of mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities comprised and of the total available for sale and held to maturity securities portfolio  respectively  at year end  the majority of which are issued by fnma and fhlmc 
the duration of the mortgage backed securities portfolio was years at december  compared to years at december  the duration of the investment portfolio was years at december  compared to years at december  the company s underlying investment strategy has been to purchase fnma and fhlmc hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  and seasoned year government sponsored enterprise gse fixed rate mortgage backed securities 
the company has focused on the purchases of these securities due to their attractive spreads versus funding costs and for their monthly cash flows that provide the company with liquidity 
this strategy is also supplemented with select purchases of bullet and callable agency securities 
the average life for mortgage backed securities  when purchased  would range between two and four years and the maturity dates for agency obligations would range between one and five years 
sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  requires the company to designate its securities as held to maturity  available for sale or trading depending on the company s intent regarding its investments at the time of purchase 
the company does not currently maintain a portfolio of trading securities 
as of december   billion  or of the portfolio  was classified as available for sale and million  or of the portfolio was classified as held to maturity 
the company believes that the high concentration of securities available for sale allows flexibility in the day to day management of the overall investment portfolio  consistent with the objectives of optimizing profitability and mitigating interest rate risk 
securities available for sale are carried at estimated fair value 
additional information about fair value measurements can be found in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
unrealized market valuation gains or losses on securities classified available for sale are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of deferred income taxes 
the net unrealized gain on securities classified as available for sale as of december  was million compared to million as of december  the decrease in the market value of securities available for sale was primarily due to declining values of trust preferred equity securities  privately issued mortgage backed securities and other bonds and obligations which includes auction rate securities  mostly offset by gains in agency mortgage backed securities 
the changes in unrealized gains and losses on the investment portfolio are primarily due to credit spreads  liquidity and fluctuations in market interest rates during the period 
the bank owns trust preferred securities with amortized cost of million  of which million are pooled trust preferred  with million rated aaa and million rated aa 
the remaining million are individual names with ratings of a to aa 
the unrealized losses reported for trust preferred equity securities relate to the general widening of credit spreads for all non government guaranteed asset classes and current market stress partially resulting from efforts by banks to raise capital 
this has in turn inflated coupon rates on new issues of trust preferred equity securities versus lower rates on the company s portfolio of a to aaa rated  non perpetual seasoned issues of trust preferred equity securities 
in accordance with the company s internal policies for review of other than temporary impairment  a detailed review of certain trust preferred equity securities was completed 
this review included an analysis of collateral reports  stress default levels and financial ratios of the underlying issuers and concluded that there was no other than temporary impairment at the end of the period 
all trust preferred equity securities carried below market value are current and no impairment of cash flows is anticipated 
the net unrealized gain on mortgage backed securities is primarily from agency mortgage backed securities issued by fnma and fhlmc  partially offset by unrealized losses on mortgage backed securities issued by private institutions primarily due to widening in non agency mortgage spreads 
in addition to the changes in market interest rates  the unrealized gain on agency mortgage backed securities are also due in part to the program initiated by the federal reserve to purchase the direct obligations of housing related gse s  fannie mae  freddie mac  and the federal home loan banks  and mortgage backed securities backed by fannie mae  freddie mac  and ginnie mae 
the goal of these purchases is to drive down long term fixed mortgage rates to stimulate the housing market as spreads on gse debt and on gse issued mortgages had widened as benchmark treasury and london interbank offered rate libor rates declined 
the unrealized loss on mortgage backed securities issued by private institutions is concentrated in four private label mortgage backed securities which are substantially paid down  well seasoned and of an earlier vintage that have not been significantly affected by high delinquency levels or vulnerable to lower collateral coverage as seen in later issued pools 
none of the securities are backed by sub prime mortgage loans  none have suffered losses and none are on the rating agencies watch list for a downgrade 
these securities are all rated aaa  are still paying principal and interest and are expected to continue to pay their contractual cash flows 
management s review of the above factors and issuer specific data concluded that these private label mortgage backed securities are not other than temporarily impaired 
the company s investment in corporate obligations consists of two securities 
one has an amortized cost of million  is rated aaa and is priced at 
the second security has an amortized cost of million  is rated bbb and is priced at 
the unrealized loss reported for corporate obligations is due to changes in market interest rates subsequent to the time of purchase 
the unrealized loss on other bonds primarily relates to auction rate certificates 
these certificates were issued by a wall street underwriting firm and are pools of government guaranteed student loans that are issued by state student loan departments 
in the first half of  the auction process for auction rate certificates began to freeze resulting from the problems in the credit markets 
the underwriter has entered into a settlement agreement with several state regulatory agencies  whereby they have agreed to repurchase these certificates from both their retail and institutional customers at par within an month time frame beginning in  however  there is no assurance that the settlement will ultimately be honored 
these securities are currently rated aaa and are still paying and are expected to continue to pay their contractual cash flows 
unrealized losses in this category also relate to a position in a short term adjustable rate mortgage mutual fund that holds positions in non agency mortgage backed securities that are facing negative mark to market pressures due to widening spreads in non agency mortgage products and are not due to customer redemptions  forced selling or losses taken on investments 
the fund carries a weighted average underlying investment credit rating of aa and it continues to pay monthly dividends 
during  management determined that the following four investments had other than temporary impairment for which charges were recorded a security in a regional bank million 
this trust preferred equity security was deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as a result of the combined factors of percentage and length of time that the security had been below book value and because the company does not expect the financial position of the bank or the current price of the security to improve meaningfully over the near term and the price of the issue implies market participants view enhanced risk in the timely receipt of all cash flows 
the company s remaining cost position in this security at december  was million 
freddie mac  as of result of actions taken on september  by the united states treasury department and the federal housing finance agency with respect to placing the freddie mac into conservatorship  the company s  shares of freddie mac series f perpetual preferred stock were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired and written down to share 
lehman brothers  upon lehman brothers september  announcement declaring chapter bankruptcy  the company recognized an other than temporary impairment charge on its holding of  shares of series c perpetual preferred stock  writing it down to share 
a security in a financial institution  this equity security was deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as a result of the combined factors of percentage and length of time that the security has been below book value and because the company does not expect the current price of the security to improve meaningfully over the near term 
management analyzed all investments with unrealized losses and at december   determined that none of these investments had other than temporary impairment 
this review entails an analysis of issuer specific data such as cash flows and credit quality  broad market details and the percentage and length of time by which as issue is below book value 
the company has the ability and intent to hold all of these securities for the time necessary to recover the unrealized losses  which may be until maturity  and timely receipt of all cash flows due is anticipated 
the investment portfolio consists of approximately of a mortgage backed securities that are issued by fnma  fhlmc and aaa rated securities issued by private institutions b us treasury obligations and c us agency securities 
the investment portfolio does not have direct exposure to sub prime lending  does not include collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles 
the company does not own or plan on investing in securities backed by sub prime mortgage collateral 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding the carrying value  weighted average yield and contractual maturities of the company s investment portfolio as of december  in the case of mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities  the table shows the securities by their contractual maturities  however  there are scheduled principal payments and there will be unscheduled prepayments prior to their contractual maturity

residential real estate loans continue to represent the largest segment of the company s loan portfolio as of december   comprising over fifty percent of total loans 
the increase of million was due to organic loan growth of adjustable rate mortgages and jumbo loans 
with competition somewhat diminished due to liquidity and credit problems for many other lenders  newalliance has been able to capture and grow this market segment 
the purchased portfolio  which is made up of prime loans individually underwritten by the company to our underwriting criteria  includes adjustable rate and and year fixed rate residential real estate loans with property locations throughout the united states with no significant exposure in any particular state 
the purchased portfolio has an outstanding loan balance of million with the largest concentration in connecticut and massachusetts totaling approximately million  followed by california and new york which each make up approximately of the purchased balance 
mid way through  the mortgage market began experiencing extreme volatility and unusual pricing due to lower liquidity which led the company to temporarily discontinue its purchased loan program 
the company resumed this program in january  but through year end  the level of purchases were approximately of the prior years  due to tightening of the credit markets and newalliance s ensuing tightening of underwriting guidelines as a condition of resuming the program 
the company compensated for this decrease in purchased mortgages by originating a record million in residential mortgage loans 
commercial real estate and commercial business loans increased million from december  to december  the increase was attributable to organic growth and a shift from the commercial construction category due to loans completing the construction phase and converting to fully amortizing commercial mortgage loans 
the commercial construction portfolio of million includes approximately million of loans to commercial borrowers for residential housing development million of which are for condominium projects 
since year end  the segment related to residential development  has experienced an increase in charge offs  delinquencies and adversely classified loans which has impacted the current year s loan loss provision and accounted for million  or of the company s total net charge offs for the year ended december  see the allowance for loan losses section located on page  and asset quality section located on page for further information concerning the allowance for loan losses 
the company is decreasing its exposure to this type of lending by limiting originations and through negotiated settlements on nonperforming loans 
as of december   commercial construction loans for residential housing development decreased million to million compared to million at december  the company s continued strategy is to build a larger percentage of the company s assets in commercial loans including real estate and other commercial loans 
to accomplish this goal  the company is expanding penetration of its geographical target area as well as promoting stronger business development efforts to obtain new business banking relationships  while maintaining strong credit quality and profitability 
home equity loans and lines of credit increased million from december  to december  these products were promoted by the company through competitive pricing and marketing campaigns as the company is committed to growing this loan segment while maintaining credit quality as a higher yielding alternative to first mortgage loans 
loan growth has been from organic originations in the company s market area  none of which is sub prime

the three loan portfolio segments that we consider as having the highest risk  and were also the main drivers of provision and net charge off numbers  are construction loans to commercial developers for residential development  and a segment of our residential real estate and home equity loan portfolios 
the company has a balance of million of commercial construction loans for residential development 
this segment has total delinquencies of million  all of which are in the over day category 
all of these loans are collateralized  and carry a specific reserve of million 
within the residential and home equity portfolios  we have a watch list of approximately million that is being closely monitored due to a drop in credit score of points or more and a score that falls below million or of those loans are over days delinquent 
at december   total delinquencies for residential real estate and home equity loans were million  which includes million in the over day category 
the company updates its fico scores at least twice a year 
the residential real estate loan portfolio has a current weighted average fico score of using the most recent score 
the portfolio of home equity lines and loans has a current weighted average fico score of the company currently monitors three loan to value ltv ratios as defined below 
the original ltv defined as original balance original value  the current balance ltv defined as current balance original value  and the estimated current ltv defined as current balance estimated current value 
the estimated current ltv is determined using several methods including the case schiller composite home price index  the national association of realtors quarterly report on msa level house price averages  and an automated valuation random sampling across vintages and regions 
the residential real estate loan portfolio and the portfolio of home equity lines and loans have an estimated current ltv of just under 
original ltv ratios for residential real estate loans and home equity lines and loans were and  respectively 
updated appraisals are generally obtained at days past due or at any point management determines that full repayment of the loan is unlikely

total loans are stated at their principal amounts outstanding  net of deferred loan fees and costs and net unamortized premium on acquired loans 
as displayed in table  nonperforming assets at december  increased to million compared to million at december  the increase is mostly due to loans for residential housing development and commercial and residential real estate  largely as a result of the current economic conditions 
the increase of million in the residential real estate portfolio was due to a relatively few number of residential mortgage loans  of which four have principal balances between  and  and the rest were below  there are a total of loans included in the million in nonperforming residential loans  of which approximately million are in the purchased loan portfolio with no specific concentration in any particular state 
the increase in residential non performing loans was primarily due to elevated residential inventory levels  declines in the median sales price of residential homes and a general worsening of the economy 
non performing loans in the commercial construction portfolio increased million  primarily related to four relationships  which totaled million as of december  and are to residential home developers for condominium projects 
similar to the residential real estate portfolio  high inventory and few sales are the primary reasons for the problems in this portfolio 
the million increase in the non performing commercial real estate portfolio primarily relates to two loans secured by retail and warehouse space due to the inability of the borrowers to properly service their debt requirements of these projects 
the company closely monitors its real estate portfolios which will likely continue to be negatively impacted by the current softening in the real estate market and the decline in real estate values 
nonperforming loans are closely monitored on an ongoing basis as part of the company s loan review and work out process 
the potential risk of loss on these loans is monitored through an evaluation and measurement of the fair value of the underlying collateral  the observable market price  or the present value of the expected future cash flows 
management uses this information to determine the appropriate loss amount to charge off  if any 
nonperforming loans as a percent of total loans outstanding continue to remain at relatively low levels and at december  were  compared to at december  the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans ratio  a general measure of coverage adequacy  was at december   less than the ratio of at year end due primarily to the increase in non performing loans of million  or 
the allowance for loan losses to total loans was at the end of the december  as compared with at year end the following tables set forth delinquencies for days and days or more in the company s loan portfolio as of the dates indicated table selected loan delinquencies at december  days days days number principal number principal number principal of balance of balance of balance dollars in thousands loans of loans loans of loans loans of loans real estate loans residential commercial commercial construction total real estate loans commercial business   consumer home equity other consumer total consumer total delinquent loans to total loans at december  days or more days or more days or more number principal number principal number principal of balance of balance of balance dollars in thousands loans of loans loans of loans loans of loans real estate loans residential commercial commercial construction total real estate loans commercial business   consumer home equity other consumer total consumer total delinquent loans to total loans other real estate owned the company classifies property acquired through foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure as other real estate owned in its financial statements 
when a property is placed in other real estate owned  the excess of the loan balance over the estimated fair market value of the collateral  based on a recent appraisal  is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
estimated fair value usually represents the sales price a buyer would be willing to pay on the basis of current market conditions  including normal loan terms from other financial institutions  less the estimated costs to sell the property 
management inspects all other real estate owned properties periodically 
subsequent writedowns in the carrying value of other real estate owned are charged to expense if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
at december   the company had million in other real estate owned 
due to current market conditions the company does expect foreclosure activity to increase in  but remain manageable 
classification of assets and loan review an internal risk rating system is used to monitor and evaluate the credit risk inherent in the commercial  commercial real estate and commercial construction loan portfolios 
under our internal risk rating system  we currently identify criticized loans as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
on a quarterly basis  a criticized asset committee composed of the chief credit officer  executive vice president of business banking and other senior officers meet to review criticized asset reports on commercial  commercial real estate and commercial construction loans that are risk rated special mention  substandard  or doubtful 
the reports and the committee focus on the current status  strategy  financial data  and appropriate risk rating of the criticized loan 
the internal risk ratings are subject to change based on the committee s review and approval 
in addition to the internal review  and at least annually  the bank outsources to a third party to conduct a review of the commercial  commercial real estate and commercial construction loan portfolios 
the primary purpose of the third party review is to evaluate the loan portfolio with respect to the risk rating profiles 
differences between the third party review and the internal risk ratings are discussed and rating classifications are adjusted accordingly 
at december   loans classified as substandard both accruing and nonaccruing totaled million  and consisted of million in commercial real estate loans  million in construction lines and million in commercial loans 
included in loans classified as substandard are million of loans that are considered impaired and carry a specific reserve of million 
impaired loans are measured based on either collateral values supported by appraisals  observed market prices or where potential losses have been identified and reserved accordingly 
special mention loans totaled million  and consisted of million of commercial real estate loans  million in construction lines and million of commercial loans 
there were no loans classified as doubtful at december  at december   loans classified as substandard both accruing and nonaccruing totaled million  and consisted of million in commercial real estate loans and million in commercial loans 
special mention loans totaled million  and consisted of million of commercial real estate loans and million of commercial loans 
there were no loans classified as doubtful at december  allowance for loan losses the board of directors and management of the company are committed to the establishment and maintenance of an adequate allowance for loan losses  determined in accordance with gaap 
our approach is to follow the most recent guidelines that have been provided by our regulators 
management believes that the methodology it employs to develop  monitor and support the allowance for loan losses is consistent with those guidelines 
while management believes that it has established adequate specific and general allowances for probable losses on loans  there can be no assurance that the regulators  in reviewing the company s loan portfolio  will not request an increase in the allowance for losses  thereby negatively affecting the company s financial condition and earnings 
moreover  actual losses may be dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the allowance for loan losses may become necessary 
the allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses based on management s on going evaluation of the risks inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
charge offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans when it is determined that the collection of loan principal is unlikely 
recoveries made on loans that have been charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
the following table sets forth activity in the company s allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated table schedule of allowance for loan losses at or for the year ended december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of period    net allowances gained through acquisition   provisions charged to operations   charge offs residential and commercial mortgage loans commercial construction commercial business loans consumer loans total charge offs recoveries residential and commercial mortgage loans commerical construction commercial business loans consumer loans total recoveries net charge offs     balance at end of period    ratios net loan charge offs to average interest earning loans allowance for loan losses to total loans allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans net loans charged off to allowance for loan losses recoveries to charge offs as displayed in table  net charge offs of million were recorded for the year ended december  and were predominantly attributable to write downs totaling million on three construction loan relationships with residential home developers for condominium developments and a commercial mortgage relationship for a retail office facility 
as a result of the net charge offs  an increase of nonaccrual loans  the periodic re rating of loans  an increase in criticized and adversely classified loans  and the overall growth in the portfolio  a provision for loan losses of million was recorded for the year ended december  this compares to net charge offs of million and a provision of million for the year ended december  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate and consistent with asset quality and delinquency indicators 
the company had an allowance of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the following table sets forth the company s percent of allowance by loan category and the percent of the loans to total loans in each of the categories listed at the dates indicated table allocation of allowance for loan losses at december  percent of percent of percent of percent of percent of loans in loans in loans in loans in loans in each each each each each category to category to category to category to category to dollars in thousands amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans residential real estate   commercial real estate   commercial construction   commercial business   consumer    unallocated    total allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses and the provision are determined based upon a detailed evaluation of the portfolio and sub portfolios through a process which considers numerous factors  including levels and direction of delinquencies  nonperforming loans  risk ratings  estimated credit losses using both internal and external portfolio reviews  current economic and market conditions  concentrations  industry data  peer comparisons  portfolio volume and mix  changes in underwriting  experience of staff  and historical loss rates over the business cycle 
the portfolios are further segregated into pools of loans that have similar loan product type and risk rating characteristics 
the data is then analyzed and estimates of losses inherent in the portfolio are determined using formula allowances for homogeneous pools of loans and criticized loans  and specific reserve requirements for impaired loans 
management follows a guiding principle that the level of the allowance for loan losses should be directionally consistent with asset quality indicators 
in establishing an acceptable range of losses for the total portfolio  the bank uses the weighted average of the individual loan portfolios based on a high and low range of losses and a historical net loss analysis dating back to the early s 
this analysis produced an allowance for loan loss ratio at a low range of and a high range of  therefore  the reserve coverage to total loans of is well within the range and  in management s opinion  at an acceptable level 
the unallocated reserve increased slightly to million  or of the total reserve  for inherent losses  yet unidentified due to the deteriorating conditions in the economy 
the is on the high side of management s established range of to  which is appropriate based on the current economic environment 
the provision and allowance for loan losses are then reviewed and approved by the company s board of directors on a quarterly basis 
goodwill and intangible assets at december   the company had intangible assets of million  a decrease of million  or  from million at december  the decrease is due to year to date amortization expense for core deposit and customer relationships as well as for the reduction of unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken in prior years related to acquisitions 
in accordance with sfas no 
business combinations  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based on their fair values on the acquisition date 
identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight line or accelerated basis  over their estimated lives 
management assesses the recoverability of intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value an impairment charge is recorded to income 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances exist that indicate a possible reduction in the fair value of the business below its carrying value 
circumstances such as adverse changes in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse actions by a regulator  unanticipated competition  the loss of key employees  or similar events may indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
for purposes of goodwill impairment evaluation  the bank is identified as the reporting unit 
the company performed its annual test for goodwill impairment during the first quarter of and an impairment charge was not deemed necessary 
no events or circumstances subsequent to those evaluations through year end indicate that the carrying value of the company s goodwill may not be recoverable  including the adverse changes in the banking and finance industries throughout given the problems the economy has experienced over the past year the company s stock price has fluctuated from a low of per share to a high of per share 
the company has not experienced the depth of problems that other financial institutions are facing related to a the deterioration in the real estate market due to its historically sound credit practices and no direct lending or investing in sub prime mortgage loans and b other than temporary impairment issues on investment securities which has been minimal and c the company s earnings have not deteriorated 
at december   the company s market value was per share  compared to a book value of per share 
sources of funds cash flows from deposits  loan and mortgage backed securities repayments  securities sales proceeds and maturities  borrowings and earnings are the primary sources of the company s funds available for use in its lending and investment activities and in meeting its operational needs 
while scheduled loan and securities repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  deposit flows and loan and investment security prepayments are influenced by prevailing interest rates and local and economic conditions and are inherently uncertain 
the borrowings primarily include fhlb advances and repurchase agreement borrowings 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this report for further borrowings information 
the company attempts to control the flow of funds in its deposit accounts according to its need for funds and the cost of alternative sources of funding 
a loan and deposit pricing committee meets weekly to determine pricing and marketing initiatives 
it influences the flow of funds primarily by the pricing of deposits  which is affected to a large extent by competitive factors in its market area and asset liability management strategies 
deposits the company receives retail and commercial deposits through its main office and other banking offices throughout connecticut locations and massachusetts locations 
customer deposits generated through the newalliance banking network are the largest source of funds used to support asset growth 
deposit customers can access their accounts in a variety of ways including branch banking  atm s  internet banking or telephone banking 
effective advertising  direct mail  well designed product offerings  good service and competitive pricing policies are strategies that attract and retain deposits 
a key strategic objective is to grow the base of checking customers by retaining existing relationships while attracting new customers 
the deposit base provides a source of funding for the bank as well as an ongoing stream of fee revenue 
the company offers a wide variety and attractive array of deposit accounts including checking  savings and certificate of deposit accounts that meet the needs of both the consumer and business customer 
table deposits december  in thousands change savings    money market    now    demand    time    total deposits as displayed in table  deposits increased million compared to december  the company s strategy was to reduce rates paid on interest bearing deposits  particularly on time deposits  in order to stabilize the net interest margin and to grow core deposits 
the strategy helped to increase our net interest margin by basis points from december  during the first quarter of the year  deposit outflows occurred due to the reduction in the average rate paid on deposits 
many of our peers did not reduce their rates as quickly  therefore  a portion of maturing time deposits was lost to competitors 
however  through continued targeted product promotions  the company was able to increase core deposits by approximately million  which more than offset the decrease in time deposits during the year 
as a result of these promotions the company was able to attract both new retail and business customers and opened approximately  checking accounts and  savings accounts throughout in addition  some time deposit customers shifted their maturing certificates of deposit into the free savings product to take advantage of a higher rate and the liquidity that the product offers compared to certificates of deposit 
the company plans on continuing this strategy and to further reduce deposit costs in the coming year 
the company had million in time deposits of  or more outstanding as of december   maturing as follows table time deposit maturities of  or more weighted average dollars in thousands amount rate three months or less  over three months through six months  over six months through twelve months  over twelve months  total time deposits  or more borrowings newalliance also uses various types of short term and long term borrowings in meeting funding needs 
while customer deposits remain the primary source for funding loan originations  management uses short term and long term borrowings as a supplementary funding source for loan growth and other liquidity needs when the cost of these funds are favorable compared to alternative funding  including deposits 
the company is a member of the federal home loan bank of boston which is part of the federal home loan bank system 
members are required to own capital stock in the fhlb and borrowings are collateralized by certain home mortgages or securities of the us government and its agencies 
the maximum amount of credit which the fhlb will extend varies from time to time depending on their policies 
the company s borrowing capacity at the fhlb boston is determined by the amount of fhlb boston capital stock owned by the company and the amount of loan and investment assets pledged to the fhlb boston by the company as collateral 
the following table summarizes the company s recorded borrowings at december  table borrowings december  in thousands change fhlb advances    repurchase agreements    mortgage loans payable   junior subordinated debentures issued to affiliated trusts  total borrowings includes fair value adjustments on acquired borrowings  in accordance with sfas no

includes fair value adjustments on acquired borrowings  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  of  and  at december  and  respectively 
the trusts were organized to facilitate the issuance of trust preferred securities 
the company acquired these subsidiaries when it acquired alliance bancorp of new england  inc and westbank corporation  inc 
the affiliated trusts are wholly owned subsidiaries of the company and the payments of these securities are irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by the company 
the acquisition fair value adjustments premiums are being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense on borrowings over their remaining term using the level yield method 
table above summarizes the company s recorded borrowings of billion at december   an increase of million  from the balance recorded at december   mainly in fhlb advances 
this increase in fhlb advances was primarily due to funding loan growth and to offset deposit outflows which occurred predominantly during the first quarter  while managing interest rate risk and liquidity 
at december   all of the company s outstanding fhlb advances were at fixed rates 
the decrease of million in repurchase agreements is primarily due to a decline in commercial customer repurchase agreements which fluctuate based on the operating needs of the customers 
stockholders equity total stockholders equity equaled billion at december   million lower than the balance at december  the decrease was primarily due to million payment of cash dividends declared on our common stock during the year ended december   treasury shares acquired for million representing million shares of our common stock  a decline in the fair market value of available for sale investment securities of million  net of tax and a decrease of million  net of tax for the sfas no 
adjustment to recognize the year over year change in the funded position of the company s pension plans 
these decreases were partially offset by current year earnings of million and stock option and restricted stock expense of million 
dividends declared in were per share compared to per share for the year ended december  book value per share amounted to and at december  and  respectively 
for information regarding our compliance with applicable capital requirements  see liquidity and capital resources below 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future short term financial obligations 
the company further defines liquidity as the ability to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers as well as maintaining the flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities 
the company s primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments and sales  maturities  paydowns and sales of investment and mortgage backed securities  borrowings from the federal home loan bank and repurchase agreements 
the company has expanded its use of borrowings from the federal home loan bank to fund loan growth while managing interest rate risk and liquidity 
at december   total borrowings from the federal home loan bank amounted to billion  exclusive of million in purchase accounting adjustments  and the company had the immediate capacity to increase that total to billion 
additional borrowing capacity of approximately million would be readily available by pledging eligible investment securities as collateral 
depending on market conditions and the company s liquidity and gap position  the company may continue to borrow from the federal home loan bank or initiate borrowings through the repurchase agreement market or the federal reserve bank s discount window 
at december  the company s repurchase agreement lines of credit totaled million  million of which was available on that date 
the company had available borrowing capacity at the discount window in the amount of million 
factors affecting liquidity include loan origination volumes  loan prepayment rates  maturity structure of existing loans  core deposit growth levels  time deposit maturity structure and retention  investment portfolio cash flows  the market value of investment securities that can be used to collateralize fhlb advances and repurchase agreements 
the liquidity position is influenced by general interest rate levels  economic conditions and competition 
for example  as interest rates decline  payments of principal from the loan and mortgage backed securities portfolio accelerate  as borrowers are more willing to prepay 
additionally  the market value of the securities portfolio generally increases as rates decline  thereby increasing the amount of collateral available for funding purposes 
the company determines its cash position daily 
the investment department compiles reports detailing the company s cash activity and cash balances occurring at its various correspondents and through its various funding sources 
the investment department then settles all correspondent and bank accounts either investing excess funds or borrowing to cover the projected shortfall 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and due from banks  short term investments and debt securities 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investment activities during any given period 
at december   cash and due from banks  short term investments and debt securities maturing within one year amounted to million  or of total assets 
newalliance s main source of liquidity at the parent company level is dividends from newalliance bank 
the main uses of liquidity are payments of dividends to common stockholders  repurchase of newalliance s common stock  the payment of principal and interest to holders of trust preferred securities  and help fund acquisitions 
there are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this report for further information on dividend restrictions 
management believes that the cash and due from banks  short term investments and debt securities maturing within one year  coupled with the borrowing line at the federal home loan bank and the available repurchase agreement lines at selected broker dealers  provide for sufficient liquidity to meet its operating needs 
if unforeseen market conditions or counterparty risk placed limitations on our ability to borrow from either the federal home loan bank or the repurchase market  the company would be able to utilize the federal reserve bank s discount window to obtain funds 
at december   the company had commitments to originate loans  unused outstanding lines of credit and standby letters of credit totaling million 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses  therefore  total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
management anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments and contractual obligations 
time deposits maturing within one year from december  amount to billion 
the retention rate of maturing time deposits for december was approximately and we expect a retention rate throughout of 
federal home loan bank advances maturing within one year from december  amount to million and interest payments of approximately million are payable in the following tables present information indicating various obligations and commitments of the company as of december  and the respective maturity dates 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any terms or covenants established in the contract and generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses

unadvanced portions of home equity loans are available to be drawn on at any time by the borrower for up to years 
commercial lines of credit are available to be drawn on at any time by the borrower for up to or years 
applicable regulations require the company and the bank to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements 
at december   the company and the bank were in full compliance with all applicable capital requirements and met the fdic requirements for a well capitalized institution 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report  and the section titled regulation and supervision in item  concerning capital requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  newalliance engages in a variety of financial transactions  that in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit  interest rate and liquidity risk or to optimize capital 
customer transactions are used to manage customers request for funding 
for the year ended december   newalliance did not engage in any off balance sheet transactions that would have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of market and interest rate risk general market risk is the exposure to losses resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company has no foreign currency or commodity price risk 
credit risk related to investment securities is low as all are investment grade or have government guarantees 
there is no direct sub prime mortgage exposure in the investment portfolio 
the chief market risk factor affecting financial condition and operating results is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure of current and future earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in interest rates and spreads 
this risk is managed by periodic evaluation of the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  determination of the level of risk considered appropriate given the company s capital and liquidity requirements  business strategy  performance objectives and operating environment and maintenance of such risks within guidelines approved by the board of directors 
through such management  the company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its net earnings to changes in interest rates 
the asset liability committee  comprised of numerous senior executives  is responsible for managing interest rate risk 
on a quarterly basis  the board of directors reviews the company s gap position and interest rate sensitivity exposure described below and asset liability committee minutes detailing the company s activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on the company s operating results  interest rate risk position and the effect changes in interest rates would have on the company s net interest income 
the extent of movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on earnings 
the principal strategies used to manage interest rate risk include i emphasizing the origination  purchase and retention of adjustable rate loans  and the origination and purchase of loans with maturities matched with those of the deposits and borrowings funding the loans  ii investing in debt securities with relatively short maturities and or average lives and iii classifying a significant portion of its investment portfolio as available for sale so as to provide sufficient flexibility in liquidity management 
by its strategy of limiting the bank s risk to rising interest rates  the bank is also limiting the benefit of falling interest rates 
the company employs two approaches to interest rate risk measurement  gap analysis and income simulation analysis 
gap analysis the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is deemed to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
at december   the company s cumulative one year interest rate gap which is the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year  was positive million  or of total assets 
the bank s approved policy limit is plus or minus 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
the following table sets forth the company s cumulative maturity distribution of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december   interest rate sensitivity gap  cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio  and cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of cumulative interest bearing liabilities ratio 
this table indicates the time periods in which interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
assumptions are made on the rate of prepayment of principal on loans and investment securities and on the sensitivity of accounts with indeterminate maturity dates 
however  this table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest yield because the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is discretionary and is subject to competitive and other pressures 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of changes in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in the gap analysis  so that when interest rates rise  the gap becomes more negative  and when interest rates fall  the gap becomes more positive 
as a result  various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same time period may  in fact  reprice at different times and at different rate levels 
it should also be noted that this table reflects certain assumptions regarding the categorization of assets and liabilities and represents a one day position  in fact  variations occur daily as management adjusts interest rate sensitivity throughout the year

tested scenarios include instantaneous rate shocks  rate ramps over a six month or one year period  static rates  non parallel shifts in the yield curve and a forward rate scenario 
the simulation analysis is used to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a specified time horizon  usually a three year period 
simulation analysis involves projecting future balance sheet structure and interest income and expense under the various rate scenarios 
the company s internal guidelines on interest rate risk specify that for a range of interest rate scenarios  the estimated net interest margin over the next months should decline by less than as compared to the forecasted net interest margin in the base case scenario 
however  in practice  interest rate risk is managed well within these guidelines 
for the base case rate scenario the flat yield curve as of december  was utilized 
this yield curve was utilized due to the recent excessive volatility in the rates markets  as well as the recent communications from the federal open market committee indicating that rates should remain at the current low levels for an extended period 
as of december   the company s estimated exposure as a percentage of estimated net interest income for the next twelve month period as compared to the forecasted net interest income in the base case scenario are as follows percentage change in estimated net interest income over twelve months basis point immediate increase in rates basis point immediate decrease in rates as of december   an immediate decrease of basis points was a realistic representation of the risk of falling rates as the federal reserve has reduced the overnight lending rate target to a range between and 
for an increase in rates  an immediate increase of basis points is also a relevant representation of potential risk given the possibility of the economy rebounding in the second half of the year due to recent reductions in the federal funds rate and the planned government stimulus package to be enacted in the first or second quarter of based on the scenarios above  net interest income would increase slightly in the month period after an upward movement in rates  and would decrease after a downward movement in rates 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on a number of assumptions including the level of market interest rates  the degree to which certain assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods to repricing react to changes in market interest rates  the degree to which non maturity deposits react to changes in market rates  the expected prepayment rates on loans and investments  the degree to which early withdrawals occur on time deposits and other deposit flows 
as a result  these computations should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not reflect any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates
