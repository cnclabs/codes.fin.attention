item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations overview we develop and distribute software that accelerates learning by improving the processing efficiency of the brain 
based on more than years of neuroscience and cognitive research  our family of products improves brain fitness with technology based exercises that build the cognitive skills required to read and learn effectively 
extensive outcomes research by independent researchers  our founding scientists  school districts and our company demonstrates the rapid and lasting gains achieved through participation in our products 
our products are marketed primarily to k schools in the us  to whom we sell through a direct sales force 
to facilitate the use of our products  we offer a variety of on site and remote professional and technical services  as well as phone  email and web based support 
since our inception  learners have used our products over million times and approximately  schools have purchased at least  of our product licenses and services 
as of december  we had full time equivalent employees  compared to at december  on january   we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of soliloquy learning  including the reading assistant product  for million in cash 
the scientific learning reading assistant combines advanced speech recognition technology with scientifically based courseware to help students strengthen fluency  vocabulary and comprehension to become proficient life long readers 
in january we announced a reduction in our workforce during the first quarter of business highlights we market our fast forword and reading assistant products primarily as a reading intervention solution for struggling special education students and english language learners 
according to the us department of education  in  of fourth graders in the united states had below basic reading scores and were not proficient in reading  and between and there was only a modest improvement in the proportion of fourth graders performing at the below basic level 
while our installed base is growing  the approximately  schools that have purchased at least  of our product licenses and services represent a small fraction of the approximately  k schools in the us 
federal education funds are a critical resource in helping school districts address the needs of the most challenged learners 
we believe that a significant proportion of our sales are funded by federal sources  particularly title one and idea special education grants 
with the passage of arra  the recent stimulus bill  together these two federal sources are projected to increase from billion in the school year to billion in the school year 

however  states continue to forecast shortfalls in their taxation revenues for fiscal because of the current recession  at least states are facing budget shortfalls for this and or next fiscal year 
sales of our products are included in the supplemental education materials segment of the overall education materials market 
simba information s publishing for the prek market april estimated or projected that the total market for k instructional materials would be billion in the supplemental materials segment of that market was billion in the technology based electronic courseware segment of the supplemental materials market would be million in company highlights for the year ended december   our total revenue increased by compared to product revenue declined by while service and support revenue increased by  primarily due to a higher number of schools on support  more services delivered  higher revenue for the reading progress indicator and oem revenue from the operations we purchased in our acquisition of soliloquy in january deferred revenue  which represents revenue to be recognized in future periods  was million on december  compared to million on december  page for the year ended december   our total booked sales decreased by from booked sales is a non gaap financial measure 
for more explanation on booked sales  see revenue below 
the decrease in booked sales is mainly because one large transaction for approximately million was booked in and no similar sized transaction was booked in in the year ended december   revenue and booked sales from reading assistant were a relatively minor part of our business 
during this period  revenue and booked sales from separately identifiable reading assistant product and service offerings were less than of the overall totals 
for the year ended december   gross profit was million compared to million in a shift in revenue mix and additional costs arising from the soliloquy acquisition negatively impacted product margins  but this was fully offset by continued improvements in our service and support margins 
operating expenses increased by million or for the year ended december  research and development expenses increased by million or  mostly due to increased development personnel costs stemming from the soliloquy acquisition 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales and marketing expenses of million or  due to lower commission payments and a focus on reducing sales related costs 
we reported a net loss of million in  compared to net income of million in the net loss was primarily due to the operating loss of million  together with income tax expense of million mainly arising from the recording of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the net income was primarily due to an income tax benefit of approximately million arising from the reduction of a portion of our deferred taxation valuation allowance 
we ended with million in cash and cash equivalents  and had no outstanding debt 
we did not use our credit line during net cash used in operating activities during was million 
results of operations revenues year ended december  dollars in thousands change change products service and support total revenues revenue compared to product revenues decreased by in compared to the decrease was mainly because one large transaction for approximately million was booked in and no similarly sized transaction was booked in this transaction included approximately million of product revenue that was recognized during our largest transaction in was for approximately million  including approximately  of product revenue that was recognized in our service and support revenue increased by in compared to due to a higher number of schools on support  more services delivered  higher revenue for the reading progress indicator and oem revenue from the operations we purchased in our acquisition of soliloquy in january at december  we had approximately more schools on support than at december  revenue compared to product revenues  which comprise the majority of our revenue  increased modestly in compared to the growth in product revenues was slower than total revenues due to lower than expected product sales  and an increase in multiple year service and support packages which include a lower proportion of product revenue 
in one customer accounted for more than of our total revenue 
our service and support revenue increased significantly in compared to due to more services delivered and a higher number of schools on support 
at december  we had approximately more schools on support than at december  the increase in schools on support was mainly due to our success in selling renewals to our growing installed base 
page booked sales and selling activity booked sales is a non gaap financial measure that management uses to evaluate current selling activity 
we believe that booked sales is a useful metric for investors as well as management because it is the most direct measure of current demand for our products and services 
booked sales equals the total value net of allowances of software  services and support invoiced in the period 
revenue on a gaap basis is recorded for booked sales when all four of the requirements for revenue recognition have been met  if any of the requirements to recognize revenue are not met  the sale is booked to deferred revenue 
we use booked sales information for resource allocation  planning  compensation and other management purposes 
we believe that revenue is the most comparable gaap measure to booked sales 
however  booked sales should not be considered in isolation from revenue  and is not intended to represent a substitute measure of revenue or any other performance measure calculated under gaap 
the following reconciliation table sets forth our booked sales  revenues and change in deferred revenue for the twelve months ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands change change booked sales less revenue other adjustments net increase decrease in deferred revenue total deferred revenue end of period booked sales in the k sector decreased by to million for compared to booked sales in the k sector were million in as previously noted  one large transaction for approximately million was booked in  whereas the largest transaction booked in was for approximately million 
booked sales to the k sector in represented of total booked sales  compared to in and in booked sales to non school customers increased by for as a result of an increase in our international sales and the oem business that we acquired as a result of the soliloquy acquisition in january we believe large booked sales are an important indicator of mainstream education industry acceptance and an important factor in reaching our goal of increasing sales force productivity 
in we continued to focus our sales force on multi site sales  and we closed transactions in excess of  compared to in and in for the year ended december   of our k booked sales were realized from sales over  for the comparable periods ending december  and  large booked sales accounted for and of booked sales respectively 
booked sales outside the k market primarily to the corrections market  private practice clinicians and international customers increased by in compared with  and in compared to international sales increased by in compared to and in compared to although federal  state and local budget pressures and the current recession make for an uncertain funding environment for our customers  we are optimistic about our growth prospects in the k market 
however  achieving our booked sales growth objectives will depend on increasing customer acceptance of our products  which requires us to continue to focus on improving our products ease of use  their fit with school requirements  and our connection with classroom teachers and administrators 
our k growth prospects are also influenced by factors outside our control including the overall level  certainty and allocation of state  local and federal funding 
for a discussion of some of the other important factors that affect our results  see risk factors 
in addition  the revenue recognized from our booked sales can be unpredictable 
our various license and service packages have substantially differing revenue recognition periods  and it is often difficult to predict which license package a customer will purchase  even when the amount and timing of a sale can be reasonably projected 
see management s discussion and analysis application of critical accounting policies for a discussion of our revenue recognition policy 
in addition  the timing of a single large order or its implementation can significantly impact the level of booked sales and revenue at any given time 
page gross profit and cost of revenues year ended december  dollars in thousands gross profit on products gross profit margin on products gross profit on service and support gross profit margin on services and support total gross profit total gross profit margin the overall gross profit margin decreased in compared to the prior year due to a shift in revenue mix 
higher margin product revenues made up of total revenues in compared to in product margins declined in  mainly due to the impact of the amortization expense arising from the intangible assets acquired from soliloquy and product costs associated with reading assistant 
service and support gross margins improved because a larger proportion of these revenues arose from support and progress tracker  which have higher margins than training and implementation services 
the overall gross profit margin improved slightly in compared to the increase in gross margin was driven primarily by increased service and support margins  partially offset by a reduction in the proportion of higher margin product revenue 
service and support revenue growth of  combined with an increase in service and support costs  resulted in an increase in the service and support gross margin from to 
the main reasons for the increase in service and support gross margin were higher staff utilization and leverage from our new tucson support center 
higher margin product revenues comprised of total revenues in compared to in operating expenses year ended december  dollars in thousands change change sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist principally of salaries and incentive compensation paid to employees engaged in sales and marketing activities  travel costs  tradeshows  conferences  and marketing and promotional materials 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in compared to is primarily due to lower incentive compensation and consulting costs  partially offset by higher salary and benefit costs resulting mainly from severance payments 
the increase in sales and marketing costs in compared to was mostly due to higher employee costs  as headcount increased by year over year  and also to higher spending on marketing initiatives such as trade shows and the use of marketing consultants  partially offset by reduced incentive compensation costs 
at december   we had field based quota bearing sales personnel selling to public schools  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
as a result of our restructuring initiative  in january we reduced the number of quota bearing personnel by eight 
research and development research and development expenses principally consist of compensation paid to employees and consultants engaged in research and product development activities and product testing  together with software and equipment costs 
research and development expenses increased by in compared to  mostly due to increased development personnel costs stemming from the soliloquy acquisition 
the increased costs for compared to were primarily due to higher outsourced development costs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses principally consist of salaries and compensation paid to our executives  accounting staff and other support personnel  as well as travel expenses for these employees  and outside legal and accounting fees 
general and administrative expenses increased by in compared to page the increase in is mostly caused by higher bad debt expense of  and severance costs of  partially offset by lower legal expenses  which decreased by  the increase in expenses compared to is mostly due to the legal  accounting  printing and travel costs of approximately  related to our secondary stock offering 
stock compensation expense was also higher in than in these costs were partially offset by lower expenses for management incentive compensation 
other income from related party in september  we signed an agreement with posit science corporation psc  transferring our patented technology to psc for use in the healthcare field 
during the twelve months ended december   and we recorded    and  respectively  for royalties received and services provided to psc 
amounts received to date have been reported as other income as we did not consider these royalties to be part of our recurring operations 
interest and other income year ended december  dollars in thousands change change interest on invested cash reclassification of service revenue miscellaneous interest and other income in  interest and other income consisted primarily of interest earned on our invested cash of  and a reclassification of  of service and support revenue relating to two customers for whom we are no longer performing services 
in  interest and other income consisted primarily of interest earned on our invested cash of  and a reclassification of  of service and support revenue relating to the same two customers 
for  interest and other income consisted primarily of interest earned of  and a reclassification of  of service and support revenue relating to the same two customers 
income tax provision benefit during  we recorded an income tax expense of million 
this expense primarily consisted of a million increase in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
this valuation allowance increase was the result of reestablishing a valuation allowance previously released in after considering all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income  we concluded that we could no longer support a deferred tax asset 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
as of december   we have us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the us federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through as of december   we have us federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal credit will expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
california state research and development credits can be carried forward indefinitely 
a significant portion of the net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards reflected above are limited annually when utilized due to an ownership change as defined by irc section a minimal portion of tax credit carryforwards that would have expired because of the limitation has been written off 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  at december  there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit line 
during we expended million of our cash for the acquisition of the assets of soliloquy learning 
we expect that during at least the next twelve months our cash flow from operations together with our current cash balances will be our primary source of liquidity and will be sufficient to provide the necessary funds for our operations and capital expenditures 
historically  we have used cash in our operations during the first half of the page year and built cash in the second half 
this pattern results largely from our seasonally low sales in the first calendar quarter  which reflects our industry pattern  and the time needed to collect on sales made towards the end of the second quarter 
we expect that this pattern will continue  and that we will use cash in operations during the first half of however  we expect that our current cash balances together with the borrowing capacity under our credit line  will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements during the first half of fiscal accomplishing this  however  will require us to meet specific booked sales targets in the k market 
we cannot assure you that we will meet our targets with respect to booked sales  revenues  expenses or operating results 
on january  we amended our existing revolving line of credit agreement with comerica bank 
the maximum that can be borrowed under the agreement is million 
the line expires on december  borrowing under the line of credit bears interest at a daily adjusting libor rate 
borrowings under the line are subject to reporting covenants requiring the provision of financial statements to comerica  and  as amended  financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum adjusted quick ratio of and net worth not less than negative million 
the agreement includes a letter of credit sublimit not to exceed million 
at december   we have an outstanding letter of credit for  there were no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit at december  and we were in compliance with all our covenants 
in february we borrowed million from the line of credit 
if we are unable to achieve sufficient cash flow from operations  we may seek other sources of debt or equity financing  or may be required to reduce expenses 
reducing our expenses could adversely affect operations by reducing the resources available for sales  marketing  research or product development 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
net cash used in operations in was million  compared to cash provided by operations of million in and million in the majority of the fluctuation in operating cash is attributable to the pattern of our receivable collections  which is dependent on the level of booked sales and the terms that we offer to our customers 
we collected million of receivables in  compared to million in  and million in net cash used in investing activities in was million  of which million relates to the acquisition of soliloquy learning assets 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  consisting of net purchases of property and equipment of million  a loan to jtt holdings of million in connection with the acquisition of soliloquy  and deferred acquisition costs incurred of during the year ended december   we purchased an enterprise wide customer relationship management system 
as of december  and  a net book value of million and million  respectively  related to the purchase and subsequent implementation of this system was included in property and equipment 
these costs will be depreciated over the initial estimated useful life of five years 
net cash generated by investing activities in was million  consisting of the maturity of short term investments of million and officer loan repayments of million  partially offset by property and equipment purchases of million 
net cash generated by financing activities in  and was million  million  and million  respectively 
net cash generated by financing activities in all three years resulted from proceeds from the exercise of stock options and through purchases of stock through the employee stock purchase plan 
there was no borrowing on our credit line in or off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commitments we have a non cancelable lease agreement for our corporate office facilities 
the minimum lease payment was approximately  per month through from through the end of the lease  the base lease payment increases at a compound annual rate of approximately 
the lease expires in december we also have a lease agreement for our tucson  arizona office through may at an average rent of approximately  per month 
in early  we entered into a new lease for our reading assistant operations in waltham  massachusetts page for approximately  square feet at an average monthly rent of approximately  that expires in september we also make royalty payments to the institutions who participated in the original research that produced our initial products 
our minimum royalty payments are  per year

application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  assumptions and judgments 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments that we make can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial statements would be affected 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments pertaining to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts are the most critical assumptions to understand in order to evaluate our reported financial results 
a detailed discussion of our use of estimates  assumptions and judgments as they relate to these polices is presented below 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of licenses to our software and from service and support fees 
software license revenue is recognized in accordance with aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position sop 
sop provides specific industry guidance and four basic criteria  which must be met to recognize revenue 
these are persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  a fixed or determinable fee  and the probability that the fee will be collected 
the application of sop requires us to exercise significant judgment related to our specific transactions and transaction types 
in cases where we grant extended payment terms to school customers  we determine if the fixed or determinable fee criterion is met by reference to the customer s specific funding sources  especially where the payment terms extend into the customer s next fiscal year 
if we determine that the fixed or determinable fee criterion is not met at the inception of the arrangement  we defer revenue recognition until the payments become due 
sales to our school customers typically include multiple elements eg  fast forword software licenses  progress tracker  our internet based participant tracking service  support  training  implementation management  and other services 
we recognize revenue using the residual method  whereby the difference between the total arrangement fee and the total vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue relating to the delivered elements 
vsoe of fair value for each element of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for support services  is also measured by the renewal price 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 
page the value of software licenses  services and support invoiced during a particular period is recorded as deferred revenue until recognized 
all revenue from transactions that include new products that have not yet been delivered is deferred until the delivery of all products 
deferred revenue is recognized as revenue as discussed below 
multiple contracts with the same customer are generally accounted for as separate arrangements except in cases where contracts are so closely related that they are effectively part of a single arrangement 
product revenue product revenue is primarily derived from the licensing of software and is recognized as follows perpetual licenses software licensed on a perpetual basis 
revenue is recognized at the later of product delivery date or contract start date using the residual method 
if vsoe does not exist for all the undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period if the undelivered element is services or when all elements have been delivered 
term licenses software licensed for a specific time period  generally three to twelve months 
revenue is recognized ratably over the license term 
individual participant licenses software licensed for a single participant 
revenue is recognized over the average period of use  typically six weeks 
service and support revenue service and support revenue is derived from a combination of training  implementation  technical and professional services  online services and customer support 
training  technical and other professional services are typically sold on a per day basis 
if vsoe exists for all elements of an arrangement or all elements except software licenses  services revenue is recognized as performed 
if vsoe does not exist for all the elements in an arrangement except software licenses  service revenue is recognized over the longest contractual period in an arrangement 
revenue from services sold alone or with support is recognized as performed 
if an arrangement includes services that are essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize the fees for the software license and the services using the percentage of completion method in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
we estimate the percentage of completion on contracts utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated hours to complete the project 
the percentage of completion method of accounting involves an estimation process and is subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future events 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including the nature of the services being performed  the complexity of the customer s information technology environment and the utilization and efficiency of our professional services employees 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses due to the inability of customers to make payments 
we adjust this allowance periodically based on our historical experience of bad debt write offs  which have been low in recent years 
cancellations and refunds are allowed in limited circumstances  and such amounts have not been significant 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities  and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets 
during  we recorded an income tax expense of million 
this expense primarily consisted of a million increase in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
this valuation allowance increase was the result page of reestablishing a valuation allowance previously released in after considering all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income  we concluded that we could no longer support a deferred tax asset 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
in evaluating our ability to realize our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we make assumptions to forecast federal and state operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment regarding the forecasts of future taxable income  and are consistent with the forecasts used to manage our business 
stock based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate stock based compensation expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected life 
the estimated expected stock price volatility decreased from in to in and increased again to in our expected stock price volatility is based upon our historical experience over the expected life of the options 
in the fourth quarter of we changed our estimate of the forfeiture rate from to  based on our experience of actual forfeiture rates 
stock compensation expense may be adjusted in the future if actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our current estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the rate of interest that we earn on our cash and cash equivalents 
we did not hold any marketable debt securities at december  a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by from the market interest rates at december  would not have a material affect on our results of operations
