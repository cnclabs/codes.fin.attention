item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year in review for the th consecutive year  the company reported a net profit  earning million 
per share  diluted in in addition  the company recorded operating profits in all four quarters of  as it has now done in consecutive quarters dating back to the second quarter of given the significance of events that took place during  the company s challenge to continue these streaks was unprecedented in recent history 
demand for air travel  especially for the low fares offered by the company  was strong during the first half of and through the summer months 
however  demand for air travel waned  especially during fourth quarter  which the company believes was a result of the crisis experienced in worldwide credit markets and the domestic recessionary environment that became evident during the year 
the company was able to gradually raise fares throughout most of the year to combat an enormous increase in fuel prices  however  during the fourth quarter  the company offered more discounted fares in order to stimulate demand as the number of people choosing to travel by air declined versus the prior year 
the company s ability to raise fares during as well as to keep prior fare increases in place was due in part to competitor capacity reductions in certain of the company s markets especially beginning in september  but was also aided by several company initiatives including a slowing of internal capacity growth at times during  optimizing the flight schedule to eliminate unproductive and less popular flights and reallocating capacity to fund market growth opportunities such as denver  and the upcoming addition of the company s newest city  minneapolis st 
paul beginning service in march  enhancement of revenue management technologies  processes  and techniques  and aggressive promotion of the company s no hidden fees  low fare brand 
in addition to having a significant impact on the entire us economy  energy and fuel prices were again a major story for airlines during after beginning the year at approximately per barrel  the price of crude oil skyrocketed to over in july this caused the company  as well as all major us airlines  to reconsider growth and capacity plans for the near future  as the devastating impact of these fuel prices was evident in the financial results of all domestic airlines 
the summer spike in oil prices  as well as other clearly evident deteriorating economic conditions that followed  caused the company to modify its growth and to plan for an expected decrease in demand for air travel 
even with fuel derivative instruments in place for approximately percent of the company s fuel consumption during  the company s fuel and oil expense increased billion versus the fuel derivative instruments the company had in place for resulted in settlement gains of billion on a cash basis  before profitsharing and income taxes  which was an increase of million compared to the fuel derivative cash settlement gains the company received during as a result of the rapid collapse in energy prices during fourth quarter  the company has effectively reduced its net fuel hedge position in place for the years from through to approximately ten percent of its anticipated fuel consumption in each of those years 
due to the manner in which the company reduced its fuel hedge for these future years primarily by selling swap instruments  which in most cases were sold at lower prices than the positions that were previously purchased  and disregarding any future potential activity involving fuel derivative instruments  the company has fixed some losses associated with these instruments and expects to pay higher than market prices for fuel for these periods 
the market value as of december  of the company s net fuel derivative contracts for through reflects a net liability of approximately million

table of contents although the company s net income of million 
per share  diluted declined compared to net income of million 
per share  diluted  much of the decline was driven by a fluctuation in certain gains and losses  recorded in accordance with sfas  that relate to fuel derivatives expiring in future periods 
these instruments contributed net losses totaling million in  but had resulted in net gains totaling million for operating income for was million  a percent decrease compared to the lower operating income primarily was due to the percent increase in the company s average fuel cost per gallon  including hedging  which counteracted an percent increase in operating revenues 
looking ahead to  the company remains cautious about demand for air travel given current domestic economic conditions 
however  the rapid decline in fuel prices combined with the announced cutbacks in domestic capacity by major us airlines  have thus far mitigated much of the impact of fewer people flying 
the company expects its net available seat mile asm capacity in first quarter to be approximately four to five percent lower than first quarter however  at this same time  competitors have reduced their seats by approximately percent in certain markets where they compete with the company 
the company has announced it will start service to minneapolis st

in addition  the company has received initial approval to acquire take off and landing slots at new york s laguardia airport from the former ata airlines  inc  which filed for bankruptcy protection in april pending final approval by the bankruptcy court and closing of the transaction  which is currently expected to be in march  the company could begin flying up to seven daily roundtrips to laguardia as early as summer the company also announced its intention to enter into codeshare agreements with two different airlines canadian carrier westjet and mexican carrier volaris 
the company and westjet plan to announce codeshare flight schedules and additional features regarding the relationship by late the company and volaris plan to announce codeshare flight schedules and additional features regarding the relationship by early certain details of these alliances are subject to approvals by both the us and canadian mexican governments 
the company is also continuing to consider codeshare opportunities with other carriers  both domestic and international 
for the year  the company currently plans to reduce its fleet by a net two aircraft 
the company plans to add new aircraft from boeing  and plans to return from lease or retire a total of fifteen aircraft 
based on current plans  the company s fleet is scheduled to total s by the end of results of operations compared with the company s net income of million 
per share  diluted in represented a decrease of million  or percent  compared to its net income of million 
per share  diluted 
the majority of the decline in net income was due to the fluctuation of certain gains and losses  recorded in accordance with sfas these included adjustments impacting earnings through the recording of gains and or losses in and associated with fuel derivatives expiring in future periods  and settlement expiration of fuel derivative instruments for cash in or  but for which gains and or losses had been recorded in earnings in a prior period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
both of these types of adjustments are related to the ineffectiveness of hedges and the loss of hedge accounting for certain fuel derivatives 
adjustments associated with fuel derivative instruments and sfas included million in net losses for  and million in net gains for these are included in other gains losses  net  which is below the operating income line  in both periods 
due to the fact that items associated with sfas have resulted in large adjustments to other gains losses  net  the company believes operating income provides a better indication of the company s financial performance for both and than does net income 
the company s operating income was million  a decrease of million  or percent  compared to the majority of this decrease in was due to the substantial increase in fuel expense  despite the fact that the company once again benefited tremendously from its fuel hedging program 
entering  the company had instruments in place for over percent of its anticipated fuel consumption needs at an average crude oil equivalent price of per 
table of contents barrel 
even with this protection  however  the company s average jet fuel cost per gallon increased from in to in operating revenues consolidated operating revenues increased billion  or percent  primarily due to a billion  or percent  increase in passenger revenues 
despite carrying approximately the same number of passengers as  the company was able to generate an percent increase in average fares 
the company raised fares several times during in an attempt to keep up with rapidly increasing jet fuel prices 
this strategy was aided by the company s own slowdown in growth as well as significant capacity reductions by competitors in certain of the company s markets 
the company purchased a total of new boeing aircraft during  and returned nine s from lease  resulting in the net addition of aircraft for the year 
this fleet growth enabled the company to fly percent more asms in versus the prior year 
however  as a result of higher fares and general economic conditions  revenue passenger miles rpms increased only percent  resulting in a load factor decrease of points to percent 
as a result of the company s management of fares  passenger revenue yield per rpm passenger revenues divided by rpms increased percent compared to unit revenue operating revenues divided by asms also increased percent compared to levels  primarily as a result of the higher rpm yield 
based on weak economic conditions  which are expected to persist at least in the short term  the company had previously made the decision to further reduce its future capacity 
the company expects a four to five percent reduction in asms in first quarter compared to first quarter and approximately a four percent year over year decline in asms for full year although recent unit revenue trends continue to be above prior year levels  there is no assurance this trend will continue 
because of the uncertainty surrounding the nation s overall economy  it is difficult for the company to precisely predict first quarter revenues 
consolidated freight revenues increased million  or percent  versus this increase primarily was due to higher rates charged for cargo and freight during the company currently expects a slight increase in consolidated freight revenues during first quarter versus first quarter  primarily due to higher rates charged 
other revenues increased million  or percent  compared to approximately half of the increase was due to an increase in charter revenues versus as the company flew charters that were not operated by competitors due to capacity reductions and or bankruptcy 
the majority of the remainder of the increase was from higher commissions earned from programs the company sponsors with certain business partners  such as the company sponsored chase visa card 
the company currently expects a slight year over year decrease in first quarter other revenues compared to first quarter primarily due to lower expected charter revenues 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses for increased billion  or percent  compared to a percent increase in capacity 
historically  except for changes in the price of fuel  changes in operating expenses for airlines are typically driven by changes in capacity  or asms 
the following presents the company s operating expenses per asm for and followed by explanations of these changes on a per asm basis and or on a dollar basis in cents  except for percentages increase decrease percent change salaries  wages  and benefits fuel and oil maintenance materials and repairs aircraft rentals landing fees and other rentals depreciation and amortization other total 
table of contents the company s casm cost per available seat mile increased percent compared to approximately percent of this increase was due to the increase in fuel expense  net of gains from the company s fuel hedging program 
the majority of the remainder of the increase was due to higher airport costs and maintenance expense 
as a result of higher fuel prices throughout much of  the company has continued its diligent focus on improving fuel efficiency and controlling non fuel costs 
the company has implemented various technology improvements  which have improved efficiency and enabled the company to grow headcount at either the same or a slower rate than capacity 
based on current cost trends  the company expects first quarter unit costs to increase from first quarter s cents  excluding any impact associated with the ineffectiveness of fuel hedges or fuel derivatives that are marked to market value because they do not qualify for special hedge accounting  primarily due to higher salaries  wages  and benefits and the continuation of higher maintenance costs 
unit costs will be negatively impacted due to the company s decision to decrease its capacity versus first quarter  as it will have similar or higher fixed costs that are spread over fewer asms 
salaries  wages  and benefits increased million on an absolute dollar basis 
nearly the entire increase was from higher salaries and wages  primarily as a result of higher average wage rates 
an increase in health and workers compensation benefits primarily caused by inflationary increases in the cost of medical care was mostly offset by a million decrease in profitsharing  attributable to lower income available for profitsharing 
the company s profitsharing expense excludes the unrealized gains and or losses the company records in its fuel hedging program as a result of sfas see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on sfas and fuel hedging 
salaries  wages  and benefits expense per asm was basically flat compared to salaries and wages per asm increased primarily due to higher wage rates  but were almost completely offset by a decline in profitsharing expense per asm  as capacity grew percent  but profitsharing expense declined percent versus based on current trends  the company expects salaries  wages  and benefits per asm in first quarter to slightly increase from fourth quarter s unit cost of cents  but not exceed cents per asm

fuel and oil expense increased billion  or percent  and on a per asm basis increased 
table of contents percent versus both the dollar and the per asm increase were driven primarily by a percent increase in the average price per gallon for jet fuel  including the impact of fuel derivatives used in hedging  and including related taxes 
as a result of the company s fuel hedging program and inclusive of the impact of sfas  the company recognized net gains totaling billion in relating to fuel derivative instruments versus million of net gains recognized in cash settlements realized from the expiration settlement of fuel derivatives were billion in versus million for the primary reason that gains recognized in fuel and oil expense during were less than the cash settlement of fuel derivatives was due to the fact that a portion of the gains associated with these settlements had already been recognized in earnings in prior periods  as they were associated with ineffective hedges or derivatives that did not qualify for sfas special hedge accounting 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in fuel prices was partially offset by steps the company has taken to improve the fuel efficiency of its aircraft  its aircraft engines  and its flight plans and procedures 
these steps resulted in a percent reduction in fuel gallons consumed per asm flown for versus as of december   the company holds fuel hedge positions for the years from through for each of these years  the company has a net fuel hedge position for approximately ten percent of its currently forecasted fuel consumption for those periods 
as of october   the company had more significant fuel derivative positions related to these future periods  but during fourth quarter  made the decision to reduce such positions to the current levels 
the company accomplished this reduced hedge by entering into additional derivative contracts through selling primarily fixed price swap derivatives 
the company believes this strategy enables it to participate in further price declines via the sold derivatives  which should materially offset further declines in value of the company s previously purchased derivatives 
this decision also benefitted the company by reducing its exposure to cash collateral requirements the company would be required to post with its counterparties if market prices continued to fall 
since  in many cases  fuel derivatives were sold at lower prices than the positions that were previously purchased  and disregarding any future potential activity involving fuel derivative instruments  the company has fixed some losses associated with these instruments and currently expects to pay higher than market prices for fuel for these future periods 
maintenance materials and repairs per asm increased percent compared to  while increasing million on a dollar basis 
on both a dollar basis and a per asm basis  engine expense accounted for almost percent of the increase and airframe expense accounted for approximately percent of the increase 
the majority of the increase in engine costs related to the company s aircraft 
for all of and the first half of  these aircraft engines were accounted for on a time and materials basis 
during the first half of  there were significantly more repair events for these engines than in the first half of this was due to the fact that the is the newest aircraft type in the company s fleet  and  as this fleet has matured  the number of engines on these aircraft undergoing their first major overhaul has increased 
as further discussed below  in june  the company transitioned to a new engine repair agreement for these aircraft and  as noted below  expense is now based on flight hours associated with engines 
the expense for engines recognized in the second half of associated with the current agreement also exceeded the expense recognized in the second half of  when repairs were still being accounted for on a time and materials basis 
the increase in airframe expense primarily was due to more planned airframe inspection and repair events than in the prior year 
these events  which are required based on the number of flight hours each individual aircraft has flown  were higher in number as well as cost per event 
in june  the company transitioned from its previous engine repair agreement with ge engines services  inc ge engines  under which repairs were done pursuant to a combination of fixed pricing and time and material terms  to a new agreement with ge engines that provides for engine repairs to be done on a rate per flight hour basis 
the previous agreement was set to expire in  while the new agreement will expire in the new agreement covers all engines currently in the company s fleet as well as future firm deliveries for this aircraft type 
under this new agreement  the company has effectively transferred risk for specified future repairs and maintenance on 
table of contents these engines to the service provider and will pay ge engines a contractual rate per hour flown  as stated in the agreement 
since expense for these engine repairs is now based on engine hours flown  as it is for the company s and fleet  this new agreement allows the company to more reliably predict future engine repair costs 
considering the new agreement  the company expects maintenance materials and repairs per asm for first quarter to be similar to the 
cents per asm experienced in fourth quarter  based on currently scheduled airframe maintenance events and projected engine hours flown 
aircraft rentals expense per asm decreased percent and  on a dollar basis  decreased slightly 
both decreases primarily were due to the fact that the company returned nine operating lease aircraft to lessors during while the company s overall asm capacity increased percent through purchases of new aircraft from boeing 
the company executed a sale and leaseback of five of its aircraft during december  and the leases qualified as operating leases 
the company also executed a sale and leaseback of an additional five of its aircraft during first quarter  and has determined that these leases will be classified as operating leases 
as a result of these transactions  the company currently expects rental expense per asm for first quarter to be in the 
cent range 
landing fees and other rentals increased million on a dollar basis and increased percent on a per asm basis  compared to the majority of both the dollar increase and per asm increase was due to higher space rentals in airports as a result of both space increases by the company to accommodate new flight activity and higher rates charged by those airports for gate and terminal space 
a portion of these higher rates charged by airports was due to other airlines reduced capacity  as airport costs are then allocated among a fewer number of total flights 
as a consequence of this continued rate inflation at various airports  the company currently expects landing fees and other rentals per asm in first quarter to be in the low 
cents per asm range 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million on a dollar basis compared to  and was up percent on a per asm basis 
the dollar increase primarily was due to the new aircraft purchased during on a per asm basis  the increase was due to a higher proportion of the company s growth being accomplished through owned aircraft 
prior to the sale and leaseback of five aircraft executed during december  the company had purchased the new aircraft received during and had returned nine previously leased aircraft back to lessors  thereby increasing the percentage of the fleet owned 
taking into account the sale and leaseback transactions completed in december and january  the company expects an increase in depreciation expense for first quarter on a per asm basis compared to fourth quarter  due to approximately the same number of owned aircraft spread over a reduced number of asms 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company s future aircraft deliveries and note for further information on the sale and leaseback transactions 
other operating expenses increased million and were up percent on a per asm basis  compared to the majority of the increases on both a dollar basis and a per asm basis were due to an increase in revenue related costs associated with the percent increase in passenger revenues such as credit card processing fees 
taking into account the reclassification of fuel taxes into fuel and oil expense as noted in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company currently expects other operating expenses on a per asm basis for first quarter to be in the cents range  primarily due to higher costs related to marketing and advertising initiatives 
other other expenses income included interest expense  capitalized interest  interest income  and other gains and losses 
interest expense increased by million  or percent  primarily due to the company s issuance of million pass through certificates in october  the company s borrowing under its million term loan in may  and its borrowing of million of the available million under its revolving credit facility in october these issuances were partially offset by declines in floating interest rates associated with the company s floating rate debt 
the company currently expects an increase in first 
table of contents quarter interest expense compared to first quarter  primarily due to a higher average debt balance associated with borrowings in see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on long term debt transactions 
capitalized interest declined percent  or million  compared to  due to a reduction in progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries and lower interest rates 
interest income decreased million  or percent  primarily due to a decrease in average rates earned on invested cash and short term investment balances 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
other gains losses  net  primarily includes amounts recorded in accordance with the company s hedging activities and sfas during the first half of  the company recorded significant gains related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges  as well as the increase in market value of fuel derivative contracts that were marked to market because they did not qualify for sfas hedge accounting  as commodity prices rose during that period 
during the second half of  when commodity prices fell  the company recorded significant losses from hedge ineffectiveness and derivatives not qualifying for sfas hedge accounting  thereby more than offsetting the gains previously recorded during the first half of the year 
during  the company recorded significant gains related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges as well as to the increase in market value of fuel derivative contracts that were marked to market because they did not qualify for sfas hedge accounting

however  the company s net profit results in both and included certain gains and losses  recorded in accordance with sfas  that relate to fuel derivatives expiring in future periods 
these adjustments  which are related to the ineffectiveness of hedges and the loss of hedge accounting for certain fuel derivatives  are included in other gains losses  which is below the operating income line  in both periods 
in  these adjustments totaled net gains of million 
for  these adjustments totaled net losses of million 
therefore  the company believes operating income provides a better indication of its financial 
table of contents performance for both and than does net income 
the company s operating income was million  a decrease of million  or percent  compared to the decrease in operating income primarily was driven by a substantial increase in fuel expense  despite the fact that the company once again benefited tremendously from its fuel hedging program 
the company had instruments in place to protect against over percent of its fuel consumption needs at an average crude oil equivalent price of per barrel 
this resulted in a million reduction to fuel and oil expense during  although  even with this protection  the company s average jet fuel cost per gallon  including fuel related taxes  increased from in to in although fuel prices began at moderately high levels  they quickly increased and stayed at record levels throughout most of the second half of the year 
market crude oil prices flirted with per barrel several times during and market unhedged jet fuel prices reached higher than per gallon during the second half of the year 
operating revenues consolidated operating revenues increased million  or percent  primarily due to a million  or percent  increase in passenger revenues 
the increase in passenger revenues primarily was due to an increase in capacity  as the company added aircraft and flights  resulting in a percent increase in available seat miles compared to the company purchased a total of new boeing aircraft during  and added another two leased s from a previous owner  resulting in the addition of aircraft for the year 
the company attempted to combat high fuel prices through modest fare increases 
however  general economic conditions as well as significant low fare competition made it difficult to raise fares as much as the company had done in the company s passenger revenue yield per rpm passenger revenues divided by revenue passenger miles increased percent compared to unit revenue total revenue divided by available seat miles also increased percent compared to levels  as a result of the higher rpm yield 
consolidated freight revenues decreased million  or percent  versus a million  or percent  increase in freight revenues  primarily resulting from higher rates  was more than offset by a million decline in mail revenues 
the lower mail revenues were due to the company s decision to discontinue carrying mail for the us postal service effective as of the end of second quarter other revenues increased million  or percent  compared to  primarily from higher commissions earned from programs the company sponsors with certain business partners  such as the company sponsored chase visa card

the remainder of the increase was due to higher maintenance expense 
all other operating expense categories combined to be approximately flat compared to due to higher fuel prices  the company intensified its focus on controlling non fuel costs and continued to mitigate wage rate and benefit cost pressures through productivity and efficiency improvements 
the company s headcount per aircraft at december   was  versus a december  level of from the end of to the end of  the company s headcount per aircraft decreased percent  as it implemented various technology improvements  which improved efficiency and enabled the company to grow capacity without a commensurate increase in headcount 
on an absolute dollar basis  salaries  wages  and benefits increased million  primarily from a million increase in salaries and wages  partially offset by a million decrease in benefits 
the dollar increase in salaries and wages primarily was due to a percent headcount increase  and the dollar decrease in benefits primarily was due to a million decrease in profitsharing  attributable to lower income available for profitsharing  and a million decrease in share based compensation  due to fewer employee stock options becoming vested during versus these benefits decreases were partially offset by higher healthcare costs 
although the company s net income was higher than  income available for profitsharing was lower  since the company s profitsharing plan does not consider the unrealized gains and or losses the company records in its fuel hedging program as a result of sfas salaries  wages  and benefits expense per asm decreased percent compared to  primarily due to lower profitsharing expense and lower share based compensation expense  despite the increase in asms

fuel and oil expense increased million  and on a per asm basis increased percent versus approximately percent of the dollar increase was due to an increase in fuel prices  and the remainder was from an increase in gallons consumed to support the percent capacity increase versus on a per asm basis  nearly the entire increase was due to higher fuel prices 
the fuel derivative instruments the company held for were not as favorable as those held in the prior year  as they were at higher average crude oil equivalent prices than the instruments that settled expired in despite this  the company s hedging program resulted in the realization of million in cash settlements during these settlements generated a reduction to fuel and oil expense of million  compared to the prior year when the company s fuel derivative instruments resulted in a million reduction to fuel and oil expense 
even with these significant hedge positions in both years  the company s jet fuel cost per gallon increased percent versus the average cost per gallon of jet fuel in was compared to in  including fuel related taxes and net of hedging gains

maintenance materials and repairs per asm increased percent compared to  while increasing million on a dollar basis 
on a dollar basis  engine expense accounted for over percent of the increase and airframe expense accounted for over percent of the increase 
with respect to airframe expense  the company completed significantly more planned airframe inspection and repair events than in these events  which are required based on the number of flight hours each individual aircraft has flown  were higher in number as well as cost per event  and were also due to the ongoing transition to a new airframe maintenance program for and aircraft which began in in engine expense  there was a significant increase in repairs for the company s aircraft engines primarily due to the maturation of this fleet  which was introduced in  and more repair events than expected 
on a per asm basis  approximately percent of the increase in maintenance materials and repairs was a result of the higher airframe expense  and approximately percent of the increase was due to the higher engine expense 
aircraft rentals expense per asm decreased percent and  on a dollar basis  decreased slightly

as of december   the amount of cash posted with this counterparty was million  and is reflected as a decrease to cash and a corresponding increase to prepaid expenses and other current assets 
increases or decreases to cash deposits posted to counterparties are reflected in operating cash flows within the changes to other current assets line item 
since the amount of cash collateral deposits held by the company at december  was billion  the net change in cash deposits for was a net operating outflow of billion 
this compares to an increase in counterparty deposits operating inflow of billion for the increase in these deposits during was due to the significant increase in fair value of the company s fuel derivative portfolio from december   to december  in conjunction with rising energy prices 
cash flows associated with purchasing derivatives  which are also classified as operating cash flows  were a net outflow of million in  but were immaterial for cash flows from operating activities for were also driven by the million in net income  plus noncash depreciation and amortization expense of million

see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the issuance and redemption of long term debt 
the company recently amended one of its counterparty agreements  and the amendment became effective in january this amendment significantly reduced the company s current exposure to cash collateral requirements 
previously  if the company became obligated to post collateral as security for its potential obligations under the agreement  all such collateral was required to be cash 
under the amendment  until january   if the company becomes obligated to post collateral for obligations in amounts of up to million and in excess of million  the company will continue to be required to post cash collateral  however  if the company becomes obligated to post collateral for obligations in amounts between million and million  the company has pledged of its boeing aircraft as collateral in lieu of cash 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  and contingent liabilities and commitments the company has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regard to future purchases of aircraft  payment of debt  and lease arrangements 
the company received boeing aircraft in  all of which were new aircraft from boeing 
three additional boeing aircraft were scheduled to be received during  however  due to a strike by machinists at boeing during the second half of the year  these aircraft were deferred until the company also retired nine of its older leased aircraft during and executed a sale and leaseback transaction for five of its owned aircraft 
due to the collapse of the credit market in and the severe economic recession  the company evaluated its future aircraft needs based on a projected decline in demand for air travel 
this led the company to revise its future firm commitments for new aircraft from boeing 
as of december   the company had reduced its firm orders to a total of aircraft for the years through the company also had reduced its options to aircraft from through  with an additional purchase rights for aircraft through as set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in january  the company further revised its firm orders to aircraft and its options to aircraft as set forth in part i  item of this filing 
the company has the option to substitute s or s for the s 
this option is applicable to aircraft ordered from boeing and must be exercised months prior to the contractual delivery date 
the leasing of aircraft including the sale and leaseback of aircraft effectively provides flexibility to the company as a source of financing 
although the company is responsible for all maintenance  insurance  and expense associated with operating leased aircraft  and retains the risk of loss for these aircraft  it has not made any guarantees to the lessors regarding the residual value or market value of the aircraft at the end of the lease terms 
as of december   the company operated leased aircraft  of which are operating leases 
as prescribed by gaap  assets and obligations under operating leases are not included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
disclosure of the contractual obligations associated with the company s leased aircraft is included below as well as in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is required to provide standby letters of credit to support certain obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business 
although the letters of credit are off balance sheet  the majority of obligations to which they relate are reflected as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
outstanding letters of credit totaled million at december  
table of contents the following table aggregates the company s material expected contractual obligations and commitments as of december  obligations by period in millions contractual obligations beyond total long term debt interest commitments capital lease commitments operating lease commitments aircraft purchase commitments other purchase commitments total contractual obligations includes current maturities  but excludes amounts associated with interest rate swap agreements related to fixed rate debt includes amounts classified as interest firm orders from boeing in addition to the above contractual fixed obligations  the company also had estimated obligations at december   related to its fuel derivative positions for the years through based on the contractual settlement date of those derivative instruments 
although the fair value of these positions can fluctuate significantly based on forward market prices for crude oil  heating oil  and unleaded gasoline  the following table displays these estimated obligations as of december  in millions total fuel derivative obligations available to the company at december   was cash on hand and short term investments totaling billion  present and future internally generated funds  and million remaining under its million bank revolving line of credit 
the company s october million borrowing under its revolving credit facility is being used for general corporate purposes and was done in order to enhance the company s liquidity as a result of the current instability of the credit market 
unless extended or renewed  the revolving credit facility expires and would require full repayment by august subsequent to december   the company executed the second tranche of a sale and leaseback transaction generating approximately million in cash for the company 
in addition  the company will also consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize earnings and supplement cash requirements 
notwithstanding current economic conditions and the current liquidity environment  the company believes it has access to financing arrangements because of its current investment grade credit ratings  unencumbered assets  modest leverage  and consistent profitability  which should enable it to meet its capital and operating requirements 
however  given the current environment  interest rates on borrowing are significantly higher than levels experienced in recent history 
as of december   the book value of the company s unencumbered aircraft totaled approximately billion 
standard poor s and fitch both recently downgraded the company s credit rating from a to bbb based on the volatility of fuel prices  current economic conditions  and a more negative assessment of the long term fundamentals of the us airline industry 
while the company s credit rating remains investment grade  as defined  the lower rating will likely result in a slight increase in its borrowing costs on a prospective basis 
moody s has also recently reaffirmed the company s baa rating  which is also considered investment grade 
in and  the company s board of directors authorized five separate programs for the 
table of contents repurchase of up to a total of billion of the company s common stock million authorized in january  million authorized in may  million authorized in november  million authorized in march  and million authorized in may repurchases were made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time  depending on market conditions 
these programs  the last of which was completed during third quarter  resulted in the repurchase of a total of approximately million shares 
during january  the company s board of directors authorized an additional program for the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock 
repurchases have been and will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time  depending on market conditions 
the company repurchased million shares for a total of million as part of this program through february   however  the company has not repurchased any additional shares from that date through the date of this filing 
the company does not believe it is prudent to repurchase shares at the current time considering today s unstable financial markets and volatile fuel prices 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
the company s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
revenue recognition as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  tickets sold for passenger air travel are initially deferred as air traffic liability 
passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided ie  when the flight takes place 
air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates 
the balance in air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity 
the company s air traffic liability balance at december  was million  compared to million as of december  estimating the amount of tickets that will be refunded  exchanged  or forfeited involves some level of subjectivity and judgment 
the majority of the company s tickets sold are nonrefundable  which is the primary source of forfeited tickets 
according to the company s contract of carriage  tickets whether refundable or nonrefundable that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight  up to a year from the date of sale  or can be refunded if the ticket is refundable 
a small percentage of tickets or partial tickets expire unused 
fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited 
air traffic liability includes an estimate of the amount of future refunds and exchanges  net of forfeitures  for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed 
these estimates are based on historical experience over many years 
the company and members of the airline industry have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date of travel 
estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability account are constantly evaluated based on subsequent refund and exchange activity to validate the accuracy of the company s estimates with respect to forfeited tickets 
holding other factors constant  a ten percent change in the company s estimate of the amount of refunded  exchanged  or forfeited tickets for would have resulted in a million  or 
percent  change in passenger revenues recognized for that period 
events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical customer travel patterns can result in actual refunds  exchanges  or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates 
the company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts 
if actual refunds  exchanges  or 
table of contents forfeiture experience results in an amount outside of this range  estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments to air traffic liability and to passenger revenue are recorded  as necessary 
additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and exchanges include  but may not be limited to  the company s refund and exchange policy  the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares  and promotional fare activity 
the company s estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year  however  as with any estimates  actual refund  exchange  and forfeiture activity may vary from estimated amounts 
no material adjustments were recorded for the years   or the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for future refunds  exchanges  and forfeited tickets would be reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
accounting for long lived assets as of december   the company had approximately billion at cost of long lived assets  including billion at cost in flight equipment and related assets 
flight equipment primarily relates to the boeing aircraft in the company s fleet at december   which are either owned or on capital lease 
the remaining boeing aircraft in the company s fleet at december   are on operating lease 
in accounting for long lived assets  the company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
the following table shows a breakdown of the company s long lived asset groups along with information about estimated useful lives and residual values of these groups estimated useful life estimated residual value aircraft and engines to years aircraft parts fleet life ground property and equipment to years leasehold improvements years or lease term in estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft  the company primarily has relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types  current and projected future market information  and recommendations from boeing 
aircraft estimated useful lives are based on the number of cycles flown one take off and landing 
the company has made a conversion of cycles into years based on both its historical and anticipated future utilization of the aircraft 
subsequent revisions to these estimates  which can be significant  could be caused by changes to the company s maintenance program  changes in utilization of the aircraft actual cycles during a given period of time  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and  when warranted  adjusts these estimates and assumptions 
generally  these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense  as required by gaap 
when appropriate  the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment 
factors that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset s  a significant change in the long lived asset s physical condition  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset 
while the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these indicators  the company has continued to operate all of its aircraft  generate positive cash flow  and produce profits 
consequently  the company has not identified any impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet 
the company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment 
the company believes it unlikely that materially different estimates for expected lives  expected residual values  and impairment evaluations would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
financial derivative instruments the company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices  and accounts for them 
table of contents under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for more information on these risk management activities and see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on sfas  the company s fuel hedging program  and financial derivative instruments 
sfas requires that all derivatives be reflected at market fair value and recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the company was a party to over financial derivative instruments  related to its fuel hedging program  for the years from through the fair value of the company s fuel hedging financial derivative instruments recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december   was a net liability of million  compared to an asset of billion at december  the large decrease in fair value primarily was due to the significant decrease in energy prices in the fourth quarter of  net of the expiration ie  settlement in which the company received cash proceeds of approximately billion in fuel derivative instruments that related to and net of new derivative instruments the company added for future years 
of the million liability in fair value of fuel hedging financial derivative instruments at december   approximately million is expected to settle  or expire during changes in the fair values of these instruments can vary dramatically  as was evident during  based on changes in the underlying commodity prices 
during  market spot prices for crude oil peaked at a high of over per barrel and hit a low price of under per barrel both within a period of approximately five months 
market price changes can be driven by factors such as supply and demand  inventory levels  weather events  refinery capacity  political agendas  and general economic conditions  among other items 
the financial derivative instruments utilized by the company primarily are a combination of collars  purchased call options  and fixed price swap agreements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in over the counter markets 
since the majority of the company s financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange  the company estimates their fair values 
depending on the type of instrument  the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
also  since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel  the company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices  as required by sfas forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices such as crude oil  heating oil  and unleaded gasoline and adjusted based on variations of those like commodities to the company s ultimate expected price to be paid for jet fuel at the specific locations in which the company hedges 
fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are both estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle  and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed  respectively 
however  once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed  all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements 
in recent years  because of increased volatility in energy markets  the company s estimates of the presumed effectiveness of its hedges made at the time the hedges were initially designated have materially differed from actual results  resulting in increased volatility in the company s periodic financial results 
for example  historical data had been utilized in qualifying unleaded gasoline for sfas hedge accounting under the presumption that derivatives of such commodity would result in effective hedges  as defined 
this historical data is updated every quarterly reporting period to ascertain whether sfas hedge accounting is allowed for every commodity the company uses in its hedging program 
based on these updates  in certain prior periods  the company has in fact lost sfas hedge accounting for all unleaded gasoline derivative instruments 
at such times  the company has marked all such derivatives to market value in each quarterly period  with all changes in value reflected as a component of other gains losses  net in the consolidated statement of income 
although 
table of contents commodities such as crude oil and heating oil have continued to qualify for hedge accounting in most cases  there have been instances in which the company has also lost hedge accounting in specific geographic locations for these commodities 
in these instances  the company has also marked such derivatives to market value with changes reflected in the income statement each reporting period 
although the company s prospective assessment has been utilized to ensure that crude oil and heating oil in most cases still qualify for sfas hedge accounting in specific locations where the company hedges  there are no assurances that these commodities will continue to qualify in the future 
this is due to the fact that future price changes in these refined products may not be consistent with historical price changes 
if recent volatility in these commodity markets continues for an extended period of time or worsens in the near future  the company could lose hedge accounting altogether for all crude oil and heating oil derivatives  which would create further volatility in the company s financial results 
estimating the fair value of these fuel derivative instruments and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their values from period to period and thus determine how they are accounted for under sfas to the extent that the change in the estimated fair value of a fuel derivative instrument differs from the change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be purchased  both on a cumulative and a period to period basis  ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge can result  as defined by sfas this could result in the immediate recording of noncash charges or income  representing the change in the fair value of the derivative  even though the derivative instrument may not expire settle until a future period 
likewise  if a derivative contract ceases to qualify for hedge accounting  the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded every period to other gains and losses in the income statement in the period of the change 
ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in other crude oil related commodities  especially given the recent volatility in the prices of refined products 
due to the volatility in markets for crude oil and related products  the company is unable to predict the amount of ineffectiveness each period  including the loss of hedge accounting  which could be determined on a derivative by derivative basis or in the aggregate for a specific commodity 
this may result  and has resulted  in increased volatility in the company s financial statements 
the significant increase in the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains and losses on the change in value of derivative contracts settling in future periods recorded during recent periods has been due to a number of factors 
these factors include the significant fluctuation in energy prices  the number of derivative positions the company holds  significant weather events that have affected refinery capacity and the production of refined products  and the volatility of the different types of products the company uses for protection 
the number of instances in which the company has discontinued hedge accounting for specific hedges and for specific refined products  such as unleaded gasoline  has increased in recent years  primarily due to these reasons 
depending on the level at which the company is hedged at any point in time  as the fair value of the company s hedge positions fluctuate in amount from period to period  there could be continued variability recorded in the income statement  and furthermore  the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains or losses recorded in earnings may be material 
this is primarily because small differences in the correlation of crude oil related products could be leveraged over large dollar volumes 
the company continually looks for better and more accurate methodologies in forecasting future cash flows relating to its jet fuel hedging program 
these estimates are an important component used in the measurement of effectiveness for the company s fuel hedges  as required by sfas the current methodology used by the company in forecasting forward jet fuel prices is primarily based on the idea that different types of commodities are statistically better predictors of forward jet fuel prices  depending on specific geographic locations in which the company hedges 
in accordance with sfas  the company then adjusts for certain items  such as transportation costs  that are stated in fuel purchasing contracts with its vendors  in order to estimate the actual price paid for jet fuel associated with each hedge 
this methodology for estimating future cash flows ie  jet fuel prices has been consistently applied during   and  in accordance with the company s interpretation of sfas the company also has not changed its method for either assessing or measuring hedge ineffectiveness during these periods 

table of contents at times  the company also utilizes financial derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swap agreements 
prior to  the company had entered into interest rate swap agreements related to its million senior unsecured notes due  its million senior unsecured notes due  its million senior unsecured notes due  and its million senior unsecured debentures due the primary objective for the company s use of these interest rate hedges was to reduce the volatility of net interest income by better matching the repricing of its assets and liabilities 
these interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges  as defined by sfas in addition  these interest rate swap agreements qualify for the shortcut method of accounting for hedges  as defined by sfas under the shortcut method  the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective  and  thus  there is no ineffectiveness to be recorded in earnings 
during  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement concurrent with its entry into a twelve year  million floating rate term loan agreement 
under this swap agreement  which is accounted for as a cash flow hedge  the interest rate on the term loan is essentially fixed for its entire term at percent and ineffectiveness is required to be measured each reporting period 
the fair values of the company s interest rate swap agreements are adjusted regularly and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
if the interest rate hedge is accounted for as a fair value hedge  the corresponding offsetting adjustment is to the carrying value of the long term debt 
for the interest rate hedge accounted for as a cash flow hedge  the corresponding offsetting adjustment is to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of appropriate taxes 
the total fair value of all interest rate swap agreements  excluding accrued interest  at december   was an asset of approximately million 
the total fair value of the swap agreements held at december   was an asset of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of financial derivative instruments  and forward jet fuel prices  would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
share based compensation the company has previously awarded share based compensation pursuant to plans covering the majority of its employee groups  including plans adopted via collective bargaining  a plan covering the company s board of directors  and plans related to employment contracts with the chairman emeritus of the company 
the company accounts for share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
the company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant utilizing a modified black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
however  certain assumptions used in the black scholes model  such as expected term  can be adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of the company s stock option awards 
option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and expected term 
in estimating expected stock price volatility at the time of a particular stock option grant  the company relies on observations of historical volatility trends  implied future volatility observations as determined by independent third parties  and implied volatility from traded options on the company s stock 
for   and option grants  the company has consistently utilized a weighted average approach that calculates expected volatility using two thirds implied volatility and one third historical volatility 
in determining the expected term of the option grants  the company has observed the actual terms of prior grants with similar characteristics  the actual vesting schedule of the grant  and assessed the expected risk tolerance of different optionee groups 
other assumptions required for estimating fair value with the black scholes model are the expected risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield of the company s stock 
the risk free interest rates used were actual us treasury zero coupon rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant 
the expected dividend yield of the 
table of contents company s common stock over the expected term of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on the company s current dividend yield  and adjusted for anticipated future changes 
vesting terms for the company s stock option plans differ based on the type of grant made and the group to which the options are granted 
for grants made to employees under collective bargaining plans  vesting has ranged in length from immediate vesting to vesting periods in accordance with the period covered by the respective collective bargaining agreement 
for grants to other employees  options generally vest and become fully exercisable over three  five  or ten years of continued employment  depending upon the grant type 
for grants in any of the company s plans that are subject to graded vesting over a service period  the company recognizes expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
none of the company s grants include performance based or market based vesting conditions  as defined 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted would be made based on the conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
fair value measurements the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas effective january  the company has determined that it utilizes unobservable level inputs in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities 
at december   these included auction rate security investments  valued at million  a portion of its fuel derivative option contracts  which were a net liability of million  and million in other investments 
all of the company s auction rate security instruments are reflected at estimated fair value in the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   approximately million of these instruments are classified as available for sale securities and million are classified as trading securities 
in prior periods  due to the auction process which took place every days for most securities  quoted market prices were readily available  which would have qualified as level under sfas however  due to events in credit markets beginning during first quarter  the auction events for most of these instruments failed  and  therefore  the company has determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis or other type of valuation model as of december  in addition  the company obtained an independent valuation of a selected number of auction rate security instruments and has considered these valuations in determining estimated fair values of other similar instruments within its portfolio 
the company s analyses consider  among other items  the collateralization underlying the security investments  the expected future cash flows  including the final maturity  associated with the securities  and estimates of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction or return to full par value 
these securities were also compared  when possible  to other securities not owned by the company  but with similar characteristics 
due to these events  the company reclassified these instruments as level during first quarter in association with this estimate of fair value  the company has recorded a temporary unrealized decline in fair value of million  with an offsetting entry to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
given the quality and backing of the company s auction rate securities held  the fact that the company has not yet recorded a loss on the sale of any of these instruments  and the fact that it has been able to periodically sell instruments in the periodic auction process  it believes it can continue to account for the estimated reduction in fair value of its remaining securities as temporary 
these conclusions will also continue to be evaluated and challenged in subsequent periods 
the company currently believes that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues  because the underlying assets for the majority of securities are almost entirely backed by the us government 
in addition  for the million in instruments classified as available for sale  these auction rate securities represented approximately six percent of the company s total cash  cash equivalent  and investment balance at december   which it believes allows it sufficient time for the securities to return to full value 
for the million in instruments classified as trading securities  the company has entered into an agreement with the counterparty that allows the company to put the 
table of contents instruments back to the counterparty at full par value in june as part of this agreement  the company has entered into a line of credit in which it has received a million loan that is secured by the auction rate security instruments from that counterparty 
at the time of the first failed auctions during first quarter  the company held a total of million in securities 
since that time  the company has been able to sell million of these instruments at par value  in addition to the million subject to the agreement to be sold at par in june the company is also in discussions with other counterparties to determine whether mutually agreeable decisions can be reached regarding the effective repurchase of its remaining securities 
the company determines the value of fuel derivative option contracts utilizing a standard option pricing model based on inputs that are either readily available in public markets  can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets  or are quoted by its counterparties 
in situations where the company obtains inputs via quotes from its counterparties  it verifies the reasonableness of these quotes via similar quotes from another counterparty as of each date for which financial statements are prepared 
the company has consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented and believes it has obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts it holds 
due to the fact that certain inputs used in determining estimated fair value of its option contracts are considered unobservable primarily volatility  as defined in sfas  the company has categorized these option contracts as level as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  any changes in the fair values of fuel derivative instruments are subject to the requirements of sfas any changes in fair value of cash flow hedges that are considered to be effective  as defined  are offset within accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the period in which the expected cash flow impacts earnings 
any changes in the fair value of fuel derivatives that are ineffective  as defined  or do not qualify for special hedge accounting  are reflected in earnings within other gains losses  net  in the period of the change 
because the company has extensive historical experience in valuing the derivative instruments it holds  and such experience is continually evaluated against its counterparties each period when such instruments expire and are settled for cash  the company believes it is unlikely that an independent third party would value the company s derivative contracts at a significantly different amount than what is reflected in the company s financial statements 
in addition  the company also has bilateral credit provisions in some of its counterparty agreements  which provide for parties or the company to provide cash collateral when the fair values of fuel derivatives with a single party exceeds certain threshold levels 
since this cash collateral is based on the estimated fair value of the company s outstanding fuel derivative contracts  this provides further validation to the company s estimate of fair values 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps  commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet  and market risk in the derivatives used to manage its fuel hedging program 
the company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices  but seeks to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy 
the company has market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases 
the company also operates aircraft under operating and capital leases 
however  leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
commitments related to leases are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on the company s accounting for its hedging program and for further details on the company s financial derivative instruments 
fuel hedging the company utilizes financial derivative instruments  on both a short term and a long term basis  as a form of insurance against the potential for significant increases in fuel prices 
the company believes there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases 

table of contents the company expects to consume approximately billion gallons of jet fuel in based on this usage  a change in jet fuel prices of just one cent per gallon would impact the company s fuel and oil expense by approximately million per year  excluding any impact of the company s derivative instruments 
as of december   the company held a net position of fuel derivative instruments that effectively represented a hedge of approximately ten percent of its anticipated jet fuel purchases for each year from through prior to fourth quarter  the company had held fuel derivative instruments for a much larger portion of its anticipated fuel purchases for these years  however  due to the recent precipitous decline in fuel prices  the company significantly reduced its hedge in order to minimize fuel hedging losses related to further oil price declines and to minimize the potential for the company to provide additional cash collateral deposits to counterparties 
the company accomplished this reduced hedge by entering into additional derivative contracts through selling primarily fixed price swap derivatives 
the company believes this strategy enables it to participate in further price declines via the sold derivatives  which should materially offset further declines in value of the company s previously purchased derivatives 
the total net fair value of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the company s jet fuel market price risk at december   was a net liability of million 
the current portion of these financial derivative instruments  or million  is classified as a component of accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the long term portion of these financial derivative instruments  or million  is included in other deferred liabilities 
the fair values of the derivative instruments  depending on the type of instrument  were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
an immediate ten percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the december  for all years from through  prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by up to approximately million 
changes in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects 
this sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at december   levels  except underlying futures prices 
the company s credit exposure related to fuel derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a net positive fair value to the company at the reporting date 
at such times  these outstanding instruments expose the company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
however  in such cases  the company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations and has not experienced any significant credit loss as a result of counterparty nonperformance in the past 
to manage credit risk  the company selects and will periodically review counterparties based on credit ratings  limits its exposure to a single counterparty  and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty 
however  if one or more of these counterparties were in a liability position to the company and were unable to meet their obligations  any open derivative contracts with the counterparty could be subject to early termination  which could result in substantial losses for the company 
at december   the company had agreements with eight counterparties containing early termination rights and or bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount or credit ratings fall below certain levels 
as of december   the company had active portfolios with three of these counterparties 
based on the company s current investment grade credit rating  for one counterparty  these collateral provisions require cash deposits to be posted whenever the net fair value of derivatives associated with that counterparty exceed a specific threshold cash is either posted by the counterparty if the value of derivatives is an asset to the company  or posted by the company if the value of derivatives is a liability to the company 
during fourth quarter  the modification of the company s fuel hedge portfolio  in combination with the amendment to one of the company s counterparty agreements that became effective in january  significantly reduced the company s current exposure to cash collateral requirements 
prior to the amendment  if the company became 
table of contents obligated to post collateral as security for its potential obligations under this counterparty agreement  all such collateral was required to be cash 
under the agreement  as amended  until january   if the company becomes obligated to post collateral for obligations in amounts of up to million and in excess of million  the company will continue to be required to post cash collateral  however  if the company becomes obligated to post collateral for obligations in amounts between million and million  the company has pledged of its boeing aircraft as collateral in lieu of cash 
as of january   assuming no changes to the company s current net fuel hedge position  the forward market price of crude oil would have to fall to approximately per barrel for each year from to before the company would exceed the million threshold that would require additional cash collateral beyond the initial million level 
at december   the company had posted million in cash collateral deposits with a counterparty under these bilateral collateral provisions 
the deposits are classified as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet

financial market risk the vast majority of the company s assets are aircraft  which are long lived 
the company s strategy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet and grow capacity steadily and profitably under the right conditions 
while the company uses financial leverage  it has maintained a strong balance sheet and a bbb rating with fitch and standard poor s  and a baa credit rating with moody s as of december  the company s and french credit agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are floating rate debt 
in addition  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has converted certain of its long term debt to floating rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
this includes the company s million senior unsecured notes due  the million senior unsecured notes due  the million senior unsecured notes due  and the million senior unsecured debentures due although there is interest rate risk associated with these floating rate borrowings  the risk for the and french credit agreements is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company may prepay this debt under certain conditions 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the material terms of the company s short term and long term debt 

table of contents excluding the notes or debentures that were converted to a floating rate as previously noted  the company s only fixed rate senior unsecured notes at december  were its million notes due these senior unsecured notes have a fixed rate of percent  which is comparable to average rates prevailing for similar debt instruments over the last ten years 
the following table displays the characteristics of the company s secured fixed rate debt as of december  principal amount in millions effective fixed rate final maturity underlying collateral secured notes specified boeing aircraft pass through certificates specified boeing aircraft term loan agreement specified boeing aircraft the carrying value of the company s floating rate debt totaled billion  and this debt had a weighted average maturity of years at floating rates averaging percent for the twelve months ended december  in total  the company s fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented percent and percent  respectively  of total noncurrent assets at december  the company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash  which totaled billion  and short term investments  which totaled million  at december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the company invests available cash in certificates of deposit  highly rated money market instruments  investment grade commercial paper  auction rate securities  and other highly rated financial instruments  depending on market conditions and operating cash requirements 
however  as a result of recent turmoil in credit markets  the company has discontinued further investments in auction rate securities 
because of the short term nature of these investments  the returns earned parallel closely with short term floating interest rates 
the company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of december   would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
a change in market interest rates could  however  have a corresponding effect on the company s earnings and cash flows associated with its floating rate debt  invested cash excluding cash collateral deposits held  if applicable  and short term investments because of the floating rate nature of these items 
assuming floating market rates in effect as of december   were held constant throughout a month period  a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would correspondingly change the company s net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than million 
utilizing these assumptions and considering the company s cash balance excluding the impact of cash collateral deposits held or provided to counterparties  if applicable  short term investments  and floating rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in rates would have a net negative effect on the company s earnings and cash flows  while a decrease in rates would have a net positive effect on the company s earnings and cash flows 
however  a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the company s earnings or cash flow associated with the company s publicly traded fixed rate debt 
the company is also subject to a financial covenant included in its revolving credit facility  and is subject to credit rating triggers related to its credit card transaction processing agreements  its outstanding debt agreements  and some of its hedging counterparty agreements 
certain covenants include the maintenance of minimum credit ratings and or triggers that are based on changes in these ratings 
for the revolving credit facility  of which million of the available million had been drawn as of december   the company must also maintain  at all times  a coverage ratio  as defined in the agreement  of not less than to 
the company met this condition as of december  however  if conditions change and the company fails to meet the minimum standards set forth in the agreement  there could be a reduction in 
table of contents the availability of cash under the agreement  or an increase in the costs to keep the agreement intact as written 
two of the company s hedging counterparty agreements contain ratings triggers in which cash collateral would be required to be posted with the counterparty if the company s credit rating falls below investment grade by two of the three major rating agencies 
as of december   there was no cash posted with these counterparties 
given the company s net fuel hedge liability with these counterparties at december   and assuming its credit rating were below investment grade as of that date  the company would have been required to post approximately million in cash collateral deposits with the counterparties 
however  these cash collateral deposit requirements would be correspondingly reduced as the underlying fuel derivative instruments settle including by approximately million in the company currently has processing agreements with organizations that process credit card transactions arising from purchases of air travel tickets by its customers utilizing american express  discover and mastercard visa 
credit card processors have financial risk associated with tickets purchased for travel because  although the processor generally forwards the cash related to the purchase to the company soon after the purchase is completed  the air travel generally occurs after that time  and the processor would have liability if the company does not ultimately provide the air travel 
under these processing agreements  and based on specified conditions  increasing amounts of cash reserves could be required to be posted with the counterparty 
a majority of the company s sales transactions are processed by chase paymentech 
should chargebacks processed by chase paymentech reach a certain level  proceeds from advance ticket sales could be held back and used to establish a reserve account to cover such chargebacks and any other disputed charges that might occur 
additionally  cash reserves are required to be established if the company s credit rating falls to specified levels below investment grade 
cash reserve requirements are based on the company s public debt rating and a corresponding percentage of the company s air traffic liability 
as of december  the company was in compliance with all credit card processing agreements 
however  the inability to enter into credit card processing agreements would have a material adverse effect on the business of the company 
the company believes that it will be able to continue to renew its existing credit card processing agreements or will be able to enter into new credit card processing agreements with other processors in the future
