overview we are an integrated wholesale coffee roaster and dealer in the united states and one of the few coffee companies that offers a broad array of coffee products across the entire spectrum of consumer tastes  preferences and price points 
as a result  we believe that we are well positioned to increase our profitability and endure potential coffee price volatility throughout varying cycles of the coffee market and economic conditions 
our operations have primarily focused on the following areas of the coffee industry the sale of wholesale specialty green coffee  the roasting  blending  packaging and sale of private label coffee  and the roasting  blending  packaging and sale of our seven brands of coffee 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors including the level of marketing and pricing competition from existing or new competitors in the coffee industry  our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers  fluctuations in purchase prices and supply of green coffee and in the selling prices of our products  and our ability to manage inventory and fulfillment operations and maintain gross margins 
our net sales are driven primarily by the success of our sales and marketing efforts and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
for this reason  we have made the strategic decision to invest in measures that will increase net sales 
in february  we acquired certain assets of premier roasters  including equipment and a roasting facility in la junta  colorado 
we also hired a west coast brand manager to market our s w brand and to increase sales of s w coffee to new customers 
in april  we entered into a joint venture with caruso s coffee of brecksville  ohio and formed generations coffee company  llc  a delaware limited liability company  which engages in the roasting  packaging and sale of private label specialty coffee products 
we own of the joint venture and are the exclusive supplier of its coffee inventory 
we believe that the generations coffee joint venture will allow us to b id on the private label gourmet whole bean business which we have not been equipped to pursue from an operational standpoint in the past 
with this specialty roasting facility in place  in many cases right in the backyard of our most important wholesale and retail customers  we believe that we are in an ideal position to combine our current canned private label business with high end private label specialty whole bean business 
high end specialty whole bean coffee sells for as much as three times more per pound than the canned coffees in which we currently specialize 
as a result of these efforts  net sales increased in our specialty green coffee  private label and branded coffee business lines in both dollars and pounds sold 
in addition  we increased the number of our customers in all three areas 
in july  we entered into a three year licensing agreement with entenmann s products  inc  a subsidiary of entenmann s  inc  which is one of the nation s oldest baking companies 
the agreement gives us the exclusive rights to manufacture  market and distribute a full line of entenmann s brand coffee products throughout the united states 
we expect to develop not only mainstream entenmann s coffee items  but upscale flavored entenmann s products in twelve ounce valve bags as well 
these products will give the line a visible upscale image to our retailers and their customers  which we believe will be integral to the long term success of this arrangement 
our net sales are affected by the price of green coffee 
we import green coffee from colombia  mexico  kenya  brazil and uganda 
the supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control 
for example  coffee crops in brazil  which produces one third of the world s green coffee  are susceptible to frost in june and july and drought in september  october and november 
however  because we purchase coffee from a number of countries and are able to freely substitute one country s coffee for another in our products  price fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material impact on the price we pay for coffee 
accordingly  price fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material effect on our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
historically  because we generally have been able to pass green coffee price increas es through to customers  increased prices of green coffee generally result in increased net sales 
however  the average indicator price for robusta coffee  the main component for our leading espresso brands caf caribe and caf supremo  is still at a historically high level 
historically  we have used short term coffee futures and options contracts primarily for the purpose of partially hedging and minimizing the effects of changing green coffee prices and to reduce our cost of sales 
in addition  we acquire futures contracts with longer terms  generally three to four months  primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee at favorable prices 
although the use of these derivative financial instruments has enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices  no strategy can entirely eliminate pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to loss when prices decline significantly in a short period of time 
in addition  we would remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non performance by the counter parties to any futures contracts 
if the hedges that we enter do not adequately offset the risks of coffee bean price volatility or our hedges result in losses  our cost of sales may in crease  resulting in a decrease in profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  income taxes and loss contingencies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  may be impacted significantly by judgment  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
under sab  revenue is recognized at the point of passage to the customer of title and risk of loss  when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment 
sales are reflected net of discounts and returns 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers inability to make required payments 
if there is deterioration of our customers credit worthiness and or there is an increase in the length of time that the receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used  additional allowances may be required 
for example  every additional one percent of our accounts receivable that becomes uncollectible  would increase our operating loss by approximately  for the year ended october  inventories are stated at cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions  inventories are subject to be written down to market value 
if our assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
each additional one percent of potential inventory writedown would have increased operating loss by approximately  for the year ended october  we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reflected on the balance sheet when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized 
accordingly  our net deferred tax asset as of october  of  may require a valuation allowance if we do not generate taxable income 
year ended october  fiscal compared to the year ended october  fiscal net loss 
we had a net loss of  or per share basic and diluted for the year ended october  compared to net income of  or 
per share basic and diluted for the year ended october  the decrease in net income primarily reflects hedging losses when the price of coffee surged to a ten year high and subsequently collapsed during february and october net sales 
net sales totaled  for the year ended october   an increase of  or from  for the year ended october  the increase in net sales reflects a increase in coffee pounds sold from million pounds in to million pounds in the increase in pounds of coffee sold is the result of increased sales of our branded  private label and specialty green coffees 
sales of our flagship hispanic espresso brands  caf caribe and caf supremo  increased once again 
the number of our customers in the specialty green coffee area grew approximately to customers 
these customers are predominately independent gourmet specialty roasters  some of whom own their own retail outlets 
sales to new customers in this area historically start slowly because many of these companies are start up ventures 
because the specialty green coffee area is the fastest growing segment of the coffee market  we believe that our customer base and sales will grow in this area 
higher coffee prices during also contributed to the increase in net sales 
cost of sales 
cost of sales for the year ended october  was  or of net sales  as compared to  or of net sales for the year ended october  cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of green coffee and packaging materials and realized and unrealized gains or losses on hedging activity 
the increase in cost of sales reflects higher green coffee prices and losses on options and futures contracts 
green coffee purchases increased  from  to  due to the increase in green coffee prices and private label and green coffee sales volumes 
fiscal was a year of increased prices and volatility in the green coffee markets  especially the london robusta market which accounts for approximately one third of our coffee purchases 
net losses on options and futures contracts  a component of cost of sales  totaled  for the y ear ended october  compared to net gains of  for the year ended october  we believe these losses resulted from a surge in commodities prices due to the us weaker dollar and a significant increase in market speculation 
according to commodities futures trading commission data  index funds almost doubled their positions in agricultural contracts from january though april as a result  fundamental players in the commodities markets lacked the liquidity necessary to maintain their positions due to margin calls 
we believe that increased regulatory scrutiny as well as risk aversion has begun to drive speculators out of the market 
we do not expect future trading losses going forward 
the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales also reflects higher green coffee prices which could not fully be passed along to customers through sales price increases 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended october  was  a decrease of  from  for the year ended october  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended october  from for the year ended october  the decrease in our margins is attributable to higher green coffee prices that we were unable to pass on to our customers as well as net losses on options and futures contracts 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses decreased  or to  for the year ended october  from  for the fiscal year ended october  due to decreases in selling and administrative expenses and a decrease of  in a write down in amounts due from our caf la rica joint venture which was dissolved in october after settlement of the litigation 
in consideration for the dismissal with prejudice of all defendants to the litigation and the release of all claims and counterclaims  caf la rica paid  in cash to coffee holding and returned to coffee holding the brick pack machine originally contributed to caf la rica by coffee holding 
selling and administrative expenses decreased  or to  for the year ended october  from  for the decrease in selling and administrative expenses reflects seve ral factors  including decreases of approximately  in shipping costs   in office salaries   in repairs and maintenance  and  in professional fees  partially offset by increases of  in insurance   in utilities   in office expenses and  of travel and entertainment 
shipping costs decreased due to increased sales to our large green coffee customers who pay the shipping expenses for product they purchase from us 
the decrease in office salaries was due to the streamlining of our support staff 
coffee holding continued to invest in upgrading its equipment  thereby reducing the costs of repairs and maintenance 
the decrease in professional services expense reflects litigation costs associated with caf la rica during the first quarter of fiscal insurance costs increased due to an increase to the cost of workers compensation coverage 
the increase in utilities reflected higher roasting output and the increased cost of natural gas 
the increase in office expenses is a result of the larger volume of sales activity 
the increase in travel expenses reflected increased travel to promote our entenmann s coffee products outside of the new york market 
other expense 
other expense decreased  or from  for the year ended october  to  for the year ended october  the decrease was attributable to a  decrease in interest and other income  a decrease of  in a write down of our investment and a decrease of  in the loss from the caf la rica joint venture  a decrease of  in management fee income earned from providing administrative services to caf la rica and an increase in interest expense of  loss before taxes and minority interest in subsidiary 
we had a loss of  before income taxes and minority interest in subsidiary for the year ended october  compared to income of  for the year ended october  the decrease was primarily attributable to increased prices of green coffee and our losses on option and futures contracts 
income taxes 
our benefit for income taxes for the year ended october  totaled  compared to a provision of  for the year ended october  the change was attributable to a loss from operations for the year ended october  compared to income from operations during the same period in net operating losses aggregating  are available for carryback to the two preceding fiscal years and any unused loss may be carried forward for twenty years expiring in fiscal year ending october  included in prepaid and refundable taxes is  which represents the amount of the refund receivable due to the carryback of the net operating loss to fiscal years ended october  and liquidity and capital resources as of october   we had working capital of  which represented a  decrease from our working capital of  as of october   and total stockholders equity of  which decreased by  from our total stockholders equity of  as of october  our working capital decreased primarily due to a decrease of  in commodities held at broker  a  increase in line of credit borrowings  a  increase in accounts payable  partially offset by a  increase in net accounts receivable  a  increase in inventories and an increase in our deferred  refundable and prepaid taxes of  at october   the outstanding balance on our line of credit was  compared to  at october  total stockholders equity decreased due to a decrease in retained earnings as a result of our ne t loss for the fiscal year and the payment of a cash dividend per share in february and the repurchase of  shares of our outstanding common stock this fiscal year at a cost of  as of october   we had a financing agreement with merrill lynch business financial services inc this line of credit is for a maximum  expires on january  and requires monthly interest payments at a rate of libor plus 
this loan is secured by a blanket lien on all of our assets 
the credit facility contains covenants that place restrictions on our operations 
among other things  these covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios  require us to maintain a minimum net worth  and prohibit us from merging with or into other companies  acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of other companies  or selling all or substantially all of our assets without the consent of the lender 
on january   we entered into a financing commitment letter with sterling national bank 
under the terms of the letter  sterling national bank has committed to establish a credit facility to refinance our existing credit facility with merrill lynch business financial services  inc and to provide for our working capital requirements 
the credit facility will be a revolving line of credit for a maximum of million with the company able to draw on the line at an amount up to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory consisting of green coffee beans and finished coffee not to exceed  the credit facility will be payable monthly in arrears on the average unpaid balance of the line of credit at an interest rate equal to a per annum reference rate currently plus 
the initial term of the credit facility would be three years and shall be automatically extended for successive periods of one year each unless one party shall have provided the other party with a written notice of termination  at least ninety days prior to the expiration of the initial contract term or any renewal term 
the credit facility will be secured by all tangible and intangible assets of the company and will be personally guaranteed by andrew gordon and david gordon 
the credit facility with sterling national bank will contain covenants that place restrictions on our operations  including covenants relating to mergers  debt restrictions  capital expenditures  tangible net worth  leverage  fixed charge coverage  dividend restrictions  restrictions on lease payments to affiliates  restrictions on changes in business  asset sale restrictions  restrictions on acquisitions  restrictions on fundamental changes  and such other covenants as are typically contained in documents relating to similar transactions 
these restrictions could adversely impact our ability to implement our business plan  or raise additional capital  if needed 
in addition  if we default under the credit facility or if our lender demands payment of a portion or all of our indebtedness  we may not have sufficient funds to make such payments 
sterling national bank s obligation to close the credit facility will be conditioned upon  among other things  the absence of any material adverse change in the business  assets  liabilities  operations  financial condition or prospects of the company between october  and the closing date  the absence of any material default by the company of its obligations or its compliance with any applicable legal requirements at the time of closing  receipt of opinions of counsel to the lender that the loan documents are legal  binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms and that the lender has a perfected security interest in all assets of the company  completion of a pre closing audit of the company by the lender and the receipt by the lender of all applicable governmental waivers and consents and landlord waivers and consents 
if the credit facility is not finalized  we may not have the ability to implement our busine ss plan or fund our operations 
for the year ended october  our operating activities used net cash of  as compared to the year ended october  when net cash provided by operating activities was  the decreased cash flow from operations for the year ended october  was primarily due to our net loss of  a  increase in accounts receivable and an increase in inventories of  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of  and a reduction in prepaid expenses of  for the year ended october   our investing activities used net cash of  as compared to the year october  when net cash used by investing activities was  the decrease in net cash used by investing activities for fiscal was due to the decrease in purchases of property and equipment 
for the year ended october   our financing activities provided net cash of  compared to net cash used in financing activities of  for the year ended october  the change in cash flow from financing activities for the year ended october  was primarily due to increased advances under our line of credit partially offset by the repurchase of outstanding common stock during the year  payment of dividends to our shareholders and partially offset by increased principal payments under the line of credit 
we expect to fund our operations  including paying our liabilities  funding capital expenditures and making required payments on our debts  through october  with cash provided by operating activities and the use of our credit facility 
in addition  an increase in eligible accounts receivable and inventory would permit us to make additional borrowings under our line of credit 
we also believe we could  if necessary  obtain additional loans by mortgaging our headquarters 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and commodity prices as further described below 
interest rate risks 
we are subject to market risk from exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at october   our debt consisted of  of variable rate debt under our revolving line of credit 
our line of credit which was amended in october and currently provides for a maximum of  expires on january  and requires monthly interest payments at a rate of libor plus 
this loan is secured by a blanket lien on all of our assets 
commodity price risks 
the supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control 
historically  we have used short term coffee futures and options contracts generally with terms of two months or less primarily for the purpose of partially hedging and minimizing the effects of changing green coffee prices  as further explained in note of the notes to financial statements in this report 
in addition  during the latter half of fiscal  we began to acquire futures contracts with longer terms generally three to four months primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee 
the use of these derivative financial instruments has enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices although we generally remain exposed to loss when prices decline significantly in a short period of time or remain at higher levels  preventing us from obtaining inventory at favorable prices 
we generally have been able to pass green coffee price increases through to customers  thereby maintaining our gross profits 
however  we cannot predict whether we will be able to pass inventory price increases through to our customers in the future 
we believe our hedging policies remain a vital element to our business model not only in controlling our cost of sales  but also giving us the flexibility to obtain the inventory necessary to continue to grow our sales while minimizing margin compression during a time of historically high coffee prices 
at october   we did not hold any futures contracts 
at october   we held futures contracts for the purchase of  pounds of coffee at an average price of per pound 
the market price of coffee applicable to such contracts was per pound at october
