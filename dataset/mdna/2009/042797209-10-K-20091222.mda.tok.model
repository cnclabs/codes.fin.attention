subsidiaries unidym  inc overview unidym is a leader in carbon nanotube based transparent  conductive films tcfs for the electronics industry 
tcfs are a critical component in devices such as touch panels  displays  and thin film solar cells 
for example  both touch panels and lcds typically employ two tcf layers per device 
unidym s tcfs offer substantial advantages over the incumbent technology  indium based metal oxides  including improved durability  lower processing costs  and lower overall cost structure 
unidym s products are based on electronics grade carbon nanotubes cnts  a class of molecules with multiple unique properties 
for instance  some varieties conduct electricity better than copper  they are stronger than steel  and they may be synthesized in bulk quantities 
in  the cnt field was highly fragmented  and arrowhead sought to consolidate the intellectual property for the technology in an effort to create a dominant position in high value cnts 
as a result of licensing from twelve universities and acquisitions of three cnt related companies  unidym owns or has exclusive license to a large portfolio of approximately key cnt related patents and patent applications 
the company believes unidym holds foundational intellectual property surrounding high value electronics grade cnt manufacturing and processing 
with this strong patent portfolio and significant experience applying this technology to electronics markets  unidym is beginning to make modest sales of its tcf film to device manufacturers and believes that it is well positioned to increase sales in unidym s management team is focused on customer interaction to optimize its products to meet customer specifications with a goal of generating product sales for touch screens in the near term 
unidym requires additional capital to fund its operations and obligations through fiscal collaborations and partnerships unidym has several ongoing joint development agreements with various partners to incorporate its transparent conductive films into touch panels and displays 
in  several prototypes were demonstrated at industry conferences 
unidym and samsung electronics co  ltd 
extended their collaboration to integrate carbon nanotube materials as the transparent conductive layer in display devices 
the world s first carbon nanotube based color active matrix electrophoretic display epd e paper was demonstrated at the society for information display in may and at the international meeting on information display imid at kintex  ilsan  korea in october the new color e paper device is a format display that uses a carbon nanotube cnt transparent electrode developed by unidym 
the display was one product of the ongoing joint development agreement between unidym and samsung 
in addition  unidym displayed a carbon nanotube based active matrix lcd made in collaboration with silicon display technology  a company based in seoul  korea 
another collaborative effort is testing the use of unidym s tcf s in solar cells 

table of contents in addition to these efforts in unidym s core focus of electronics  unidym is seeking to leverage its broad intellectual property portfolio in other areas through its licensing and other collaborative programs 
in march  unidym sub licensed certain of its intellectual property to ensysce biosciences inc ensysce whose focus is research into the medical therapeutic applications of carbon nanotubes 
from march to november  ensysce was both funded and effectively controlled by a related party to unidym who also serves as a director of unidym 
in november  unidym sold its percent interest in ensysce to the controlling shareholder and recognized a gain of  on the sale during the first quarter of fiscal unidym entered into a strategic alliance with the battelle memorial institute in july to explore opportunities to leverage their respective capabilities to commercialize products incorporating carbon nanotubes 
battelle is the world s largest non profit independent research and development organization  with  employees in more than locations worldwide 
in  unidym expanded this relationship to include an alliance focused on multi functional nano composites for aerospace and transportation applications 
unidym s carbon nanotubes have been used to increase strength and flexibility in the engine cowling of an aerobatic airplane  while reducing stress failures due to flight loads  showing potential for similar uses in other aerospace applications 
production production of carbon nanotube based transparent conductive films unidym s film production model involves in house pilot production and outsourced supply of larger volumes of a proprietary grade of cnts under an exclusive supply agreement  formulation of those cnts into a coating ink  and then shipment of that ink to an outsourced coating partner or customer for deposition 
to conserve cash and pursue a strategy designed to yield revenues in the short term  unidym is exploring partnerships or outsourcing within this supply chain 
unidym has in house deposition or coating equipment which is used for the deposition of cnts onto plastic or glass substrates in sample quantities 
unidym has also tested production samples from several coating subcontractors 
the use of outsourced coating partners for its touch panel films would take advantage of the substantial excess capacity left in the coating industry by the decrease in demand for photographic film 
unidym expects that  given the abundance of these subcontractors and the availability of cost effective subcontract capacity  there will be no need to bring production capacity in house in the near term 
however  longer term  unidym could decide to bring such production in house 
production of carbon nanotubes unidym has historically produced carbon nanotubes in house 
in line with its strategy to work with manufacturing partners  in may  unidym transferred a portion of its assets for cnt production to ccni  a manufacturer of cnts and carbon black  and is in the process of negotiating a license and supply agreement with ccni for the production of unidym s cnt supply needs 
the consideration for the assets to be transferred and licenses to be granted in the second agreement is still being negotiated  but is expected to consist of upfront payments and royalties 
unidym anticipates retaining some limited in house cnt production capability for product improvements and as a second source of supply 
unidym plans to manufacture cnt inks and is negotiating with potential partners to manufacture and sell films to customers 
marketing and sales unidym expects to generate revenue from sales of thin films  sale of cnts and sale of cnt based ink in fiscal revenue is expected to be generated through direct product sales and license deals into relatively consolidated industries 
in addition  unidym plans to take advantage of its extensive metrology equipment and excess space to create a small incubator for start ups that will defray costs for its sunnyvale facility 
in the near term  unidym does not expect to generate enough revenue to self fund its operations and growth 
unidym has terminated its distribution relationship with the large japanese trading firm  sumitomo  but unidym expects to continue to generate revenues through direct sales of its hipco grade cnts 
competition unidym faces competition from a number of start ups and established companies in the industries it enters 
in the electronics industry  there are a number of start up or private companies that are focused on the application or production of nanotubes including automate  c nano  eikos  nantero and southwest nanotechnologies 
more established companies with announced cnt programs include brewer sciences  dupont  honeywell  samsung  sumitomo and toray 
there are also potential competitors who are pursuing alternative nanotech based approaches to the markets served by unidym  including the start up cambrios and large japanese companies such as fujitsu 

table of contents intellectual property unidym controls an intellectual property portfolio containing over foreign and domestic patents and patent applications 
the portfolio contains patent claims directed to fundamental carbon nanotube compositions of matter  as well as carbon nanotube synthesis  purification  dispersion and functionalization 
furthermore  the portfolio contains claims to the use of carbon nanotubes in many different application areas including fibers  electronics  composite materials  energy storage generation  medical devices and drug delivery 
some patents and patent applications are owned by unidym or co owned with partners such as continental carbon and tokyo electron  but most are exclusively licensed from institutions such as rice university  georgia tech  clemson  university of florida  suny  and caltech 
under its agreement with clemson  unidym has an exclusive license to us patent  which we believe has the earliest priority date of any patent claiming transparent  conductive films comprised of carbon nanotubes 
under its agreement with caltech  unidym has the right to sublicense us patent  which is the basic patent claiming small diameter nanotube composition of matter 
unidym also has the right to license an ip portfolio related to modified fullerene for non therapeutic fields of use 
unidym has licensed its intellectual property to dupont  ensysce biosciences  nexeon medsystems  nano c  and other third parties 
unidym is currently executing a plan to encourage third parties and competitors to enter non exclusive licenses of its intellectual property outside of its core product areas 
a material portion of unidym s intellectual property portfolio is exclusively licensed from rice university 
if the sum of unidym s debts  liabilities and other obligations is greater than all of unidym s assets at fair valuation or if unidym is generally not paying its debts  liabilities and other obligations as they come due  the rice license will terminate and unidym may lose rights to critical intellectual property

calando pharmaceuticals  inc overview calando is a clinical stage nano biotechnology company at the forefront of rnai therapeutics 
calando has developed a nanoparticle based drug delivery system for sirna 
calando s platform technology is being used in a phase i clinical trial to systemically deliver for what is believed to be for the first time a sirna drug candidate targeting cancer 
although the trial is not complete  no significant drug related toxicities have been observed and the trial appears to be yielding promising results 
calando is based on pioneering technology invented in the chemical engineering division of the california institute of technology 
developed to reduce the debilitating effects of cancer treatment  calando s proprietary molecules are designed to improve the safety and efficacy of cancer therapeutics 
currently focused on sirna and oncology applications  calando s platform technology has the potential to be applied to a wide range of diseases beyond cancer as well as to therapeutic classes beyond sirna therapeutics 
in  calando successfully completed a phase clinical study with its first therapeutic candidate  it  comprised of calando s system coupled with a small molecule chemotherapeutic drug 
calando is focused on the clinical development of rondel tm  its sirna delivery technology  and calaa  the associated drug candidate 
the further development of the small molecule delivery platform and it  the associated drug candidate  has been partnered to another company 
calando requires additional capital to fund its operations and obligations through fiscal platform technology based on a novel polymeric sugar linear cyclodextrin molecule  calando s drug delivery system has been applied thus far to the delivery of two classes of therapeutics sirna and other oligonucleotides and small molecule drugs 
the polymer is combined with the drug molecule to form drug containing nanoparticles sized larger than nanometers and smaller than nanometers 
this size is important  drug molecules are typically sized below nanometers and are quickly cleared from the body in the urine 

table of contents nanoparticles sized larger than nanometers circulate longer and thus can allow administration of lower doses to patients 
nanoparticles sized smaller than nanometers can escape the circulatory system through the abnormally leaky blood vessels that feed tumors and are retained in the tumor tissue due to a lack of effective tumor lymphatic drainage 
preferential accumulation in tumor tissue  where the drug can take effect  leaves other tissues relatively unaffected 
patients from calando s first clinical trial reported fewer and less serious side effects with several cases of stable disease over many months of treatment  including one case of pancreatic cancer that was stabilized for seventeen months 
the drug delivery system has the added benefits of increasing solubility  allowing targeting of the nanoparticles  and being non immunogenic 
calando s rondel technology rna interference or rnai is a naturally occurring mechanism for the regulation of gene expression that selectively inhibits the activity of  or silences  target genes 
discovered by scientists in who were subsequently awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in  rnai has been hailed as a tremendous breakthrough 
because many diseases are caused by the inappropriate activity of genes  rnai has potential application to many serious or fatal diseases including cancer  aids  hepatitis c  huntington s disease and others 
the mechanism is mediated by small interfering rna known as sirna 
one of the key challenges to using rnai therapy has been the inability to systemically deliver sirna in humans 
naked sirna is degraded and destroyed by nucleases in the bloodstream and is not taken up by cells 
calando s rondel system is providing new hope that effective sirna delivery can be achieved safely and economically 
calando s polymers form the foundation for its three part rnai oligonucleotide nanoparticle delivery rondel technology 
the first component is the positively charged polymer that  when mixed with sirna  binds to the negatively charged backbone of the sirna 
the polymer and sirna self assemble into nanoparticles less than nm diameter that fully protect the sirna from nuclease degradation in serum 
the cyclodextrin in the polymer enables the surface of the particles to be decorated by stabilizing agents and targeting ligands 
these surface modifications are formed by proprietary methods involving the cyclodextrins 
logo the surface modifying agents have terminal adamantane groups that form inclusion complexes with the cyclodextrin and contain poly ethylene glycol peg to endow the particles with properties that prevent aggregation  enhance stability and enable systemic administration 
targeting molecules can be covalently attached to the adamantane peg modifier  enabling the sirna containing particles to be targeted to tissues of interest 
rondel technology offers the following advantages generalized delivery system binds to and self assembles with the sirna to form uniform colloidal sized particles 
analysis has shown that these particles are spherical and less than nm in diameter 
ease of administration the rondel system has been designed for use as part of a two vial system one vial contains the delivery components  and the second vial contains the therapeutic sirna payload 
when mixed pursuant to a simple protocol  the particles self assemble into sirna containing nanoparticles 
any sirna sequence can be easily substituted because rondel binds to the sirna backbone  theoretically  any sirna therapeutic could be in the second vial 
stealthy delivery to the immune system the sugar based delivery vehicle allows for repeat dosing without the risk of immune reactions 
unlike lipid delivery vehicles  the cyclodextrin based rondel delivery system does not cause an interferon response 
safety has been shown to be non toxic in in vitro testing with human cell cultures  and the fully formulated polymer sirna particles exhibit a significant therapeutic window of safety in animals  even when repeated doses up to eight doses over a four week period are used 
no serious adverse events have been observed in calando s current phase i clinical trial 

table of contents stable under physiological conditions particles have been shown to be stable under physiological conditions 
effective targeted delivery calando and its partners have demonstrated successful delivery of functional sirna therapeutics to tumor cells and to hepatocytes by systemic administration and confirmed sequence specific gene inhibition in animal models 
calaa calaa is a combination of rondel and a patented sirna targeting the m subunit of ribonucleotide reductase  a clinically validated cancer target 
ribonucleotide reductase catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleosides to deoxyribonucleosides and is necessary for dna synthesis and replication 
the sirna  developed at calando  demonstrates potent anti proliferative activity across multiple types of cancer cells 
we believe the use of calaa in calando s phase i trial  initiated in june  was the first sirna therapeutic candidate to target cancer in a human clinical study and also the first systemic delivery of an sirna therapeutic candidate 
the trial is utilizing a dose escalation protocol which is nearing the highest dose in the protocol and yielding promising preliminary results 
the trial is not currently enrolling new patients for reasons other than safety or efficacy  but calando expects to begin enrolling patients again in the near term 
calando plans to finish the phase i trial  as capital resources allow  and is seeking a partner for the further development of both the sirna delivery platform and calaa calando s cyclosert tm technology it the other polymeric drug delivery technology  cyclosert  was designed by calando s scientists for the delivery of small molecule drugs 
cyclosert provides many of the same benefits as the rondel system 
calando completed a phase trial with it  comprised of calando s polymer and camptothecin  a potent anti cancer drug  with a positive safety profile and indications of efficacy 
on june   calando entered into agreements to license cyclosert and it to cerulean pharma  inc cerulean  a boston based biotech company 
under the terms of the agreements  calando granted cerulean an exclusive royalty bearing worldwide license to certain patent rights and know how and transferred to cerulean certain intellectual property related to the linear cyclodextrin drug delivery platform and it in exchange for an initial payment of million 
under the agreements  calando retains the rights to use the linear cyclodextrin drug delivery platform to deliver tubulysin  cytolysin the rights to deliver both of which were sublicensed by calando to r d biopharmaceuticals gmbh  second generation epothilones  as well as any kind of nucleic acid  eg  a dna or sirna therapeutics 
as such  calando retains the rights to its rondel tm platform  as well as the calaa and calaa lead drugs 
in connection with the cerulean agreements  calando closed its phase clinical studies for it outsourced clinical trial management  r d  manufacturing and supply calando used contract manufacturers to manufacture each of its product candidates and has on hand sufficient material to complete the calaa phase study 
these materials were manufactured in accordance with a quality control and quality assurance program  including a set of standard operating procedures and specifications  designed to ensure that its products are manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing procedures  or cgmps  and other applicable domestic and foreign regulations 
currently  calando has no laboratory facilities and is reliant on contract r d facilities to support its clinical trial 
along with its internal resources  calando uses consultants to manage and monitor its clinical trial 
calando has no plans to establish a laboratory or manufacturing facility and will continue to rely on third parties to meet these needs 
the development of calaa  it and other pipeline candidates are preliminary  and there is no assurance that they will be successful 
there are numerous technical  regulatory and marketing challenges that must be overcome to successfully commercialize calando s products  including  but not limited to the following advancing pipeline candidates requires extensive preclinical testing and approval by the us food and drug administration fda before clinical testing can commence 
advancing therapeutic candidates through preclinical and clinical testing is expensive  resource intensive and time consuming 
complications may arise that would cause the clinical testing to be interrupted or stopped 
fda approval is required before products can be sold 
even if fda approval is eventually obtained  there is no assurance that it will be accepted by the medical community 
it is not possible at this time to accurately determine the final cost of the development projects  the completion dates  or when or if revenue will commence 

table of contents intellectual property calando controls an intellectual property portfolio of patents covering the linear cyclodextrin polymers and related technology the linear cyclodextrin system 
the portfolio covers both rondel and cyclosert 
in june  calando entered in to a drug development partnership with cerulean pharma  inc the cerulean deal 
as part of the cerulean deal  calando sold and assigned to cerulean pharma certain calando owned patents acquired ip directed to linear cyclodextrin polymers conjugated to drugs 
additionally  calando granted cerulean an exclusive license under its right to the linear cyclodextrin system to develop certain drug products 
however  excluded from the exclusive license to cerulean are rights to use the linear cyclodextrin system to develop drugs in which the therapeutic agent is a nucleic acid eg  sirna  a second generation epothilone  tubulysin or cytolysin 
additionally  cerulean granted to calando an exclusive fully paid up royalty free license under the acquired ip to use the linear cyclodextrin system to develop drugs in which the therapeutic agent is a nucleic acid eg  sirna  a second generation epothilone  tubulysin or cytolysin 
calando also owns an issued patent covering the sirna active ingredient in calaa and has filed a patent application to cover the sirna active ingredient of calaa calando has licensed patents from alnylam relevant to sirna therapeutics for calaa and calaa calando has in licensed from r d pharmaceuticals exclusive rights to second generation synthetic epothilones 
calando has out licensed to r d the use of the linear cyclodextrin system for delivering tubulysin and cytolysin drugs 
in any case  the rnai and nanoparticle drug delivery patent landscape is complex and rapidly evolving 
as such  calando may need to obtain additional patent licenses prior to commercialization of its lead drug candidates 
the drug delivery and oncology markets despite advances in drug discovery  pharmaceutical firms remain challenged by getting the right compound to the right place in the human body  where it can maximize effect 
additionally  over the next decade  multiple blockbuster pharmaceuticals will go off patent  resulting in a significant loss to the pharmaceutical industry as generic versions of these drugs enter the market 
patent expiration coupled with a challenging drug discovery environment  and continued problems with late stage trial failures has left pharmaceutical pipelines thin 
in response  the industry has pursued reformulation of existing or previously failed compounds using new drug delivery technology to expand pipelines and prolong patent life 
the global drug delivery market for all delivery technologies is expected to exceed billion in the market for targeted delivery of small molecule pharmaceuticals using particulate liposomal delivery systems is estimated to grow to billion in according to the american cancer society  cancer is the second leading cause of death in the united states and accounts for approximately one in every four deaths 
the national institutes of health has estimated the direct medical cost of cancer to be in excess of billion per year 
dose limiting toxicity  poor tissue specificity  and large effective distribution are major restrictive factors in effective cancer chemotherapy 
consequently  complete tumor response is not often achieved in patients receiving chemotherapy alone 
this offers a potential for significant opportunity for firms developing technologies to more effectively deliver anti cancer agents to malignant cells 
competition calando is engaged in the rapidly changing business of developing treatments for human disease through the regulation of gene expression and delivery of proprietary novel cancer therapies 
competition in these fields is intense as other companies are developing therapies similar to our nanoparticle drug delivery systems  and targeting patient populations that are similar to the patient populations that are targeted by calando 
a number of companies are pursuing research and development programs relating to the emerging area of cancer therapies using nanoparticle conjugates and rna interference 
a number of these companies have filed patent applications in these areas 
it is difficult to predict whether any of these companies will be successful in obtaining patent protection  whether the patent protection sought will address important aspects of the technology and to what extent these companies will be successful in their rna interference efforts 
new competitors may arise and we may not be aware of all competitors in this space 
a number of calando s competitors are more established and have greater resources than calando does 
furthermore  even if calando is successful in developing commercial products  it is possible that competitors will achieve greater market acceptance 
systemic delivery of sirna and other oligonucleotide therapeutics has proven critical for the success of all nucleic acid therapeutics 
naturally  multiple firms have recognized the problem of systemic sirna delivery as a significant opportunity and other firms are developing products in this space 
companies developing sirna delivery products include but are not limited to alnylam  merck  roche  tekmira  rxi pharmaceuticals  pharmrx and intradigm 
additionally  many academic groups are developing and may seek to commercialize sirna delivery technologies

leveraging arrowhead s expertise in carbon nanotubes  agonn was pursuing a strategy to acquire energy storage technologies based on nanoscale engineering from research institutions and outsourced testing of various prototypes 
as part of arrowhead s strategy to conserve cash in  agonn curtailed its development efforts and its current efforts are minimal 
at september   agonn had no facilities or employees and is managed by arrowhead 
tego biosciences corporation tego s primary asset is an intellectual property portfolio which includes key patents for the modification of fullerenes  a family of symmetrical carbon cage molecules with antioxidant properties 
in order to exploit the therapeutic potential of fullerenes  they must first be chemically modified to render them water soluble 
a patented process  known as the bingel reaction is of particular significance to fullerene chemistry because it enables modification of the fullerene sphere to provide solubility and appropriate physiologic behavior 
tego has a sole license to a patent directed at the bingel reaction itself  as well as a large number of modified soluble fullerenes created through its use 
tego also owns or has exclusive licenses to patents directed to a variety of medical uses of bingel modified fullerenes 
tego is pursuing a strategy of partnering and licensing its intellectual property and has terminated its research and development efforts 
as of september   tego had no employees or facilities and is managed by arrowhead 
in line with this strategy  on july   tego exclusively licensed to the bronx project  inc tbp  a development stage pharmaceutical company  the rights to develop and commercialize carboxylated fullerenes  eg  the fullerene c  in the fields of parkinson s disease  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or lou gehrig s disease  multiple sclerosis  brain trauma and schizophrenia

minority investments nanotope  inc overview nanotope is a company in the field of regenerative medicine developing a suite of products customized to regenerate specific tissues  including neuronal  vascular  bone  myocardial  and cartilage 
its two lead clinical candidates are focused on spinal cord regeneration and treatment of peripheral artery disease pad 
pad causes the loss of vasculature in the extremities and it has been estimated that as many as of people over the age of have some form of pad 
currently there is no treatment for regenerating lost vasculature 
nanotope has demonstrated in multiple animal models that injection of its angiogenic compound leads to revascularization of affected areas 
importantly  neither the spinal cord nor pad treatments use stem cells 
nanotope s products work with surviving cells and tissues to spur regeneration 
the company acquired its initial stake in nanotope from a nanotope shareholder in april and increased its position through a direct investment of million in two tranches of million each in july and in september at september   the company owned of nanotope s outstanding securities 
the company is interested in increasing its stake in nanotope if the opportunity arises  the company has the capital resources and nanotope s technology development continues to move forward

leonardo biosystems  inc overview leonardo is a drug delivery company that employs a novel multi layer drug delivery mechanism aimed at dramatically increasing targeting efficiency 
the company currently owns of leonardo 
leonardo s silicon microparticulate technology 
table of contents involves transporting a therapeutic agent past multiple biological barriers using multiple carriers  each optimized for a specific barrier 
leonardo s proprietary primary vehicles are designed to preferentially accumulate at tumor vasculature 
secondary carriers are then released from the primary carriers that are designed to accumulate around tumor cells and release their therapeutic payloads 
animal testing suggests that leonardo s platform enables significantly increased targeting

academic partnerships since inception  arrowhead has worked with some of the most outstanding academic institutions in the country  including the california institute of technology caltech  stanford university  duke university and the university of florida  in critical areas such as stem cell research  carbon electronics and molecular diagnostics 
this has provided the company with a deep network in the academic community  insight into cutting edge technologies and a world class scientific advisory board 
through these partnerships  arrowhead has gained access to exclusive rights that have formed the basis for the company s subsidiaries and minority investments and has leveraged university resources to further develop and test technology in a highly cost effective way 
the collaborations with academic scientists have included technology licenses and options to license technology  sponsored research  donations to the labs of individual scientists and use of university facilities that are made available to development stage companies 
in prior years  arrowhead devoted significant capital resources to sponsored research 
as the subsidiaries have matured  the company has decreased its reliance on sponsored research for technology development and sponsored research expense has decreased 
as of september   arrowhead had one active sponsored research agreement at duke university through unidym 
depending on capital resources  arrowhead is likely to continue to invest in nanoscience research and development through sponsored research agreements at universities 
item a 
risk factors we are a development stage company and we have limited historical operations 
we urge you to consider our likelihood of success and prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by entities at similar stages of development 
the following is a summary of certain risks we face 
they are not the only risks we face 
additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business and results of operations 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks  and investors could lose all or part of their investment 
in assessing these risks  investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
risks related to our financial condition we do not have sufficient cash reserves to fund our activities at their current pace beyond the next fiscal year 
our plan of operations is to provide substantial amounts of development funding and financial support for our majority owned subsidiaries over an extended period of time 
our board of directors adopted a cash conservation strategy that scaled back our financial support for our majority owned subsidiaries  unidym and calando 
this has influenced unidym s decision to engage partners for its capital intensive bulk cnt manufacturing and concentrate its resources on its cnt inks and cnt based film products 
calando s board of directors has determined to partner future development efforts for its drug delivery platforms and clinical candidates 
management has developed a plan based upon the latest financing see note subsequent events which includes the december financing and several other transactions which are expected to close in the near term 
the plan shows that the company has enough cash to fund all operations through september  should a shortfall occur in expected cash receipts  the plan has contingencies to reduce operations in order to operate through september  without additional financing 

table of contents we may need to obtain additional capital to support our projects  and we may plan to do so by out licensing technology  selling one or more of our subsidiaries  securing funded partnerships  conducting one or more private placements of equity securities of the company or our subsidiaries  selling additional securities in a registered public offering  or through a combination of one or more of such financing alternatives 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any of these endeavors or  if we are successful  that such transactions will be accomplished on favorable terms 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we will be required to implement additional cash saving measures by limiting further activities at unidym  or at the company  which could materially harm our business and our ability to achieve cash flow in the future  including delaying or reducing implementation of certain aspects of our plan of operations 
even if we are successful in obtaining additional capital  because we and each subsidiary are separate entities  it could be difficult or impossible to allocate funds in a way that meets the needs of all entities 
a substantial portion of unidym s intellectual property is licensed from rice university and the rice license includes an insolvency provision 
through its merger with carbon nanotechnologies  inc cni  unidym acquired a license to certain intellectual property from rice university 
under the license  unidym must meet a solvency test in order to retain the rights to the licensed technology 
although unidym is not insolvent at this time  if unidym does not obtain additional capital  it is likely that it would become insolvent and the rice license would be subject to potential termination 
if the rice license terminates  unidym would lose exclusivity in the fields of use covered by the rice license and its business would be materially and irrevocably harmed 
in this case  the likelihood that the company would realize any return on its investment in unidym would be substantially diminished  if not eliminated entirely 
this would likely materially and irrevocably harm the value of the company 
the current financial market conditions may exacerbate certain risks affecting our business 
neither the company nor our subsidiaries generate substantial revenue  and  to date  our operations  research and development activities have been primarily funded through the sale of company securities and securities of our subsidiaries 
current market conditions are likely to impair our ability to raise the capital we need 
if we are unable to secure additional cash resources from the sale of securities or other sources  it could become necessary to further slow  interrupt or close down development efforts at unidym 
in addition  we may have to make additional cuts in expenses at the company  which could impair our ability to manage our business and our subsidiaries 
even if investment capital is available to us  the terms may be onerous in light of the state of the current market 
if investment capital is needed and available to unidym and or calando and the company does not have the funds to make a pro rata investment  our ownership interest could be significantly diluted 
the sale of additional company stock to fund operations could result in significant dilution to stockholders 
the strategy for eventual monetization of our subsidiaries will likely depend on our ability to exit our ownership position in each subsidiary in an orderly manner 
exit opportunities could include an initial public offering ipo for the subsidiary or acquisition of the subsidiary by another company 
due to the current economic climate  companies are adopting conservative acquisition strategies and  even if there is interest  they may not be able to acquire our subsidiaries on terms that are attractive to us  if at all 
these factors could reduce the realizable return on our investment if we are able to sell a subsidiary 
additionally  the market for ipos is severely limited  which limits public exit opportunities for our subsidiaries 
our business may be harmed if we cannot maintain our listing on the nasdaq capital market 
to maintain our listing on the nasdaq capital market we must satisfy certain minimum financial and other continued listing standards  including  among other requirements  i a minimum bid price requirement and ii a million minimum stockholders equity requirement   minimum net income requirement or million minimum market value of listed securities requirement 
as of december   the bid price of our common stock was per share and our market value for listed securities was approximately million 
at september  our stockholders equity was million and our net loss was million for the fiscal year ended september  we previously received a notice of non compliance from nasdaq regarding our stockholders equity 
on august   nasdaq informed the company that our stockholders equity as of june  million complied with nasdaq listing rules 
however  it is possible going forward that nasdaq may decide our stockholders equity is insufficient for continued compliance 
we may face deficiencies in our stockholders equity in the future and  if we cannot resolve such deficiencies  our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq capital market 
as of july   nasdaq reinstated the minimum bid requirement for continued listing 
on september   we received a deficiency letter from the nasdaq stock market indicating that  based on our closing bid price for the last consecutive business days  we did not comply with the minimum bid price as set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule a 
in accordance with nasdaq marketplace rule c a  we have been provided a grace period of calendar days  or until march   to regain compliance by maintaining a minimum closing bid price of per share for consecutive business days 
as of december   our common stock was trading at  which is below the minimum bid price requirement 
as a result  we may need to effect a reverse stock split to raise our stock price over to regain compliance with nasdaq listing rules 
at a special meeting of stockholders on october   a proposal was approved giving authority to our board of directors to effect a reverse stock split of our common stock in the range of to  if deemed necessary 
despite the ability of the board of directors to effect a reverse stock split if necessary  there is no assurance that such a reverse stock split would in fact enable us to meet the minimum bid price requirement and stockholders may suffer a decline in value of their shares as many stocks do not trade at or above the implied post split price 

table of contents in addition  because of cash constraints  we may have to go dark and stop filing reports with the sec 
if we stop filing reports with the sec  that would negatively affect our stockholders ability to sell their shares 
in addition  we would be under breach of certain agreements if we stop filing reports with the sec  which would expose us to potential legal action 
if our common stock is delisted by  or we voluntarily delist from nasdaq  our common stock may be eligible to trade on the otc bulletin board or the pink otc markets 
in such an event  it could become more difficult to dispose of  or obtain accurate quotations for the price of our common stock  and there would likely also be a reduction in profile in the investment community and the news media  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further 
as a consequence  our inability to maintain our listing on nasdaq could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in a loss of confidence by investors  suppliers and employees 
in addition  our stockholders ability to trade or obtain quotations on our shares could be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays 
these factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask price for our common stock 
we have debt on our consolidated balance sheet  which could have consequences if we were unable to repay the principal or interest due 
unidym 
we have debt on our consolidated balance sheet  including a capital lease obligation acquired in connection with unidym s acquisition of nanoconduction  inc as of september   the capital lease obligation requires us to pay a total of  in monthly payments of  each for capital equipment at unidym s sunnyvale  california location and the equipment itself serves as collateral for the debt 
unidym s ability to make payments on its indebtedness will depend on its ability to conserve the cash that it has on hand and to generate cash in the future 
neither unidym nor the company currently generates significant revenue 
because unidym does not currently have a substantial amount of cash on hand  unidym might be required to divert cash from development activities or to generate cash via debt or equity financing to be able to meet the monthly payment requirements under the capital lease obligation 
this  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
also  given the current economic climate  financing options might be limited going forward  which could prevent unidym from obtaining the necessary funds to pay its indebtedness when due 
because the equipment serves as collateral for the debt  if unidym is unable to make the monthly payments when due  the lessor of the equipment  at its discretion  may seize the equipment and unidym would not be able to use the equipment in its development activities 
calando 
calando has a  unsecured convertible promissory note outstanding 
the note bears interest accrued annually and has a two year maturity 
the note is also payable at two times face value in certain events  including  among other things  the license of calando s sirna delivery system 
following maturity  the note becomes payable on demand 
if calando is unable to meet its obligations to the bearer of the note after maturity  we may also not be in a position to lend calando sufficient cash to pay such demand note 
unless other sources of financing become available  this could result in calando s insolvency 
our subsidiaries have entered into technology license agreements with third parties that require us to satisfy obligations to keep them effective  and if these agreements are terminated  our technology and our business would be seriously and adversely affected 
through our subsidiaries  we have entered into exclusive  long term license agreements with rice university  california institute of technology  alnylam pharmaceuticals  inc and other entities to incorporate their proprietary technologies into our proposed products 
these license agreements require us to pay royalties and satisfy other conditions  including conditions related to the commercialization of the licensed technology 
we cannot give any assurance that we will successfully incorporate these technologies into marketable products or  if we do  whether sales will be sufficient to recover the amounts that we are obligated to pay to the licensors 
failure by us to satisfy our obligations under these agreements may result in the modification of the terms of the licenses  such as by rendering them non exclusive  or may give our licensors the right to terminate their respective agreement with us  which would limit our ability to implement our current business plan and harm our business and financial condition 
risks related to our business model and company we are a development stage company and our success is subject to the substantial risks inherent in the establishment of a new business venture 
the implementation of our business strategy is still in the development stage 
we currently own majority interests in two subsidiary companies  ownership interest in the non operating subsidiaries  investments in two early stage biotech companies and  through unidym  one university research project at duke university 
our business and operations should be considered to be in the development stage and subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business venture 
accordingly  our intended business and operations may not prove to be successful in the near future  if at all 
any future success that we might enjoy will depend upon many factors  several of which may be beyond our control  or which cannot be predicted at this time  and which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  business prospects and operations and the value of an investment in the company 

table of contents the costs to fund the operations of unidym is difficult to predict  and our anticipated expenditures in support of unidym may increase or decrease for a variety of reasons 
development  manufacturing and sale of cost effective electronic products incorporating carbon nanotubes may require significant additional investment and take a long time 
it is possible that the development and scale up of unidym s carbon nanotube manufacturing effort and its development and scale up of its transparent conductive film products could be delayed for a number of reasons  including unforeseen difficulties with the technology development and delays in adoption of the technology by customers 
any delay would result in additional unforeseen costs  which would harm our results of operations 
due to these uncertainties  we cannot reasonably estimate the size  nature or timing of the costs to complete the development of unidym s products or net cash inflows from unidym s current activities 
calando may be unable to find additional partners to license its technologies 
as part of our cash conservation strategy that scales back our financial support for calando at this time  calando has closed its laboratory facilities  eliminated its technical employees and has shifted its focus to licensing its technologies to partners 
currently  calando has one licensing partner  but there can be no assurance that calando will be able to find additional partners to license its technologies upon terms favorable to calando 
if calando licenses its technologies  it will lose a considerable amount of control over its intellectual property and may not receive adequate licensing revenues in exchange 
the business model of our subsidiaries has historically been to develop new nanotechnologies and to exploit the intellectual property created through the research and development process to develop commercially successful products 
calando has licensed a portion of its technology to cerulean pharma  inc and intends to pursue further licensing arrangements with other companies 
as calando licenses its technology to other companies  it will lose control over certain of the technologies it licenses and will be unable to significantly direct the commercialization of its technologies 
in addition  calando s licensees may not be successful in the further commercialization of calando s technologies and anticipated revenues from such license agreements may be less than expected or may not be paid at all 
there are substantial inherent risks in attempting to commercialize new technological applications  and  as a result  we may not be able to successfully develop nanotechnology for commercial use 
the company finances research and development of nanotechnology  which is a new and unproven field 
our scientists and engineers are working on developing technology in various stages 
however  such technology s commercial feasibility and acceptance is unknown 
scientific research and development requires significant amounts of capital and takes an extremely long time to reach commercial viability  if at all 
to date  our research and development projects have not produced commercially viable applications  and may never do so 
during the research and development process  we may experience technological barriers that we may be unable to overcome 
for example  our scientists must determine how to design and develop nanotechnology applications for potential products designed by third parties for use in cost effective manufacturing processes 
because of these uncertainties  it is possible that none of our potential applications will be successfully developed 
if we are unable to successfully develop nanotechnology applications for commercial use  we will be unable to generate revenue or build a sustainable or profitable business 
because we have not generated significant revenues to cover our operating expenses  we are dependent on raising additional capital from investors or lenders 
to date  we have only generated a small amount of revenue as a result of our current plan of operations 
given our strategy of financing new and unproven technology research  there is no assurance we would ever generate significant revenues 
our revenue producing opportunities depend on liquidity events within our subsidiaries  such as a sale of the subsidiary  licensing transaction or initial public offering 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to create a liquidity event for any of our subsidiaries and  even if we are able to  we cannot be certain of the timing or the potential proceeds to arrowhead as a stockholder 
accordingly  our revenue prospects are uncertain and we must plan to finance our operations through the sales of equity securities or debt financing 
if we are unable to continue raising operating capital from these sources  we may be forced to curtail or cease our operations 
we will need to achieve commercial acceptance of our applications to generate revenues and achieve profitability 
even if our research and development yields technologically feasible applications  we may not successfully develop commercial products  and even if we do  we may not do so on a timely basis 
if our research efforts are successful on the technology side  it could take at least several years before this technology will be commercially viable 
during this period  superior competitive technologies may be introduced or customer needs may change  which will diminish or extinguish the commercial uses for our applications 
because nanotechnology is an emerging field  the degree to which potential consumers will adopt nanotechnology enabled products is uncertain 
we cannot predict when significant commercial market acceptance for nanotechnology enabled products will develop  if at all  and we cannot reliably estimate the projected size of any such potential market 
if markets fail to accept nanotechnology enabled products  we may not be able to generate revenues from the commercial application of our technologies 
our revenue growth and achievement of profitability will depend substantially on our ability to introduce new technological applications to manufacturers for products accepted by customers 
if we are unable to cost effectively achieve acceptance of our technology among original equipment manufacturers and customers  or if the associated products do not achieve wide market acceptance  our business will be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents we will need to establish additional relationships with strategic and development partners to fully develop and market our products 
we do not possess all of the resources necessary to develop and commercialize products that may result from our technologies on a mass scale 
unless we expand our product development capacity and enhance our internal marketing  we will need to make appropriate arrangements with strategic partners to develop and commercialize current and future products 
if we do not find appropriate partners  or if our existing arrangements or future agreements are not successful  our ability to develop and commercialize products could be adversely affected 
even if we are able to find collaborative partners  the overall success of the development and commercialization of product candidates in those programs will depend largely on the efforts of other parties and is beyond our control 
in addition  in the event we pursue our commercialization strategy through collaboration  there are a variety of attendant technical  business and legal risks  including a development partner would likely gain access to our proprietary information  potentially enabling the partner to develop products without us or design around our intellectual property  we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators may be willing or able to devote to the development or commercialization of our product candidates or to their marketing and distribution  and disputes may arise between us and our collaborators that result in the delay or termination of the research  development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts our management s resources 
the occurrence of any of the above risks could impair our ability to generate revenues and harm our business and financial condition 
we need to retain a controlling interest  by ownership  contract or otherwise  in unidym and calando in order to avoid potentially being deemed an investment company under the investment company act of companies that have more than us stockholders or are publicly traded in the us or are  or hold themselves out as being  engaged primarily in the business of investing  reinvesting or trading in securities are subject to regulation under the investment company act of unless a substantial part of our assets consists of  and a substantial part of our income is derived from  interests in majority owned subsidiaries and companies that we primarily control  whether by contract or otherwise  we may be required to register and become subject to regulation under the investment company act 
because investment company act regulation is  for the most part  inconsistent with our strategy of actively managing and operating our portfolio companies  a requirement to operate our business as a registered investment company would restrict our operations and require additional resources for compliance 
if we are deemed to be  and are required to register as  an investment company  we will be forced to comply with substantive requirements under the investment company act  including limitations on our ability to borrow  limitations on our capital structure  restrictions on acquisitions of interests in associated companies  prohibitions on transactions with our affiliates  restrictions on specific investments  and compliance with reporting  record keeping  voting  proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations 
in order to avoid regulation under the investment company act  we may choose to make additional pro rata investments in unidym and calando to maintain a controlling interest 
nanotechnology enabled products are new and may be viewed as being harmful to human health or the environment 
there is public concern regarding the human health  environmental and ethical implications of nanotechnology that could impede market acceptance of products developed through these means 
nanotechnology enabled products could be composed of materials such as carbon  silicon  silicon carbide  germanium  gallium arsenide  gallium nitride  cadmium selenide or indium phosphide  which may prove to be unsafe or harmful to human health or to the environment because of the size  shape or composition of the nanostructures 
for this reason  these nanostructures may prove to present risks to human health or the environment that are different from and greater than the better understood risks that may be presented by the constituent materials in non nanoscale forms 
because of the potential  but at this point unknown  risks associated with certain nanomaterials  government authorities in the us or individual states  and foreign government authorities could  for social or other purposes  prohibit or regulate the use of some or all nanotechnologies 
the us environmental protection agency has in that regard recently taken steps towards regulation of the manufacture and use of certain nanotechnology enabled materials  including those containing carbon nanotubes or nanosilver 
further  the us national academy of sciences national research council concluded that the us government needs to develop a more robust and coordinated plan for addressing the potential environmental  health  and safety risks of nanomaterials 
the regulation and limitation of the kinds of materials used in or used to develop nanotechnology enabled products  or the regulation of the products themselves  could halt or delay the commercialization of nanotechnology enabled products or substantially increase the cost  which will impair our ability to achieve revenue from the license of nanotechnology applications 

table of contents we may not be able to effectively secure first tier research and development projects when competing against other ventures 
we compete with a substantial number of other companies that fund early stage  scientific research at universities to secure rights to promising technologies 
in addition  many venture capital firms and other institutional investors invest in companies seeking to commercialize various types of emerging technologies 
many of these companies have greater resources than we do 
therefore  we may not be able to secure the opportunity to finance first tier research and commercialization projects 
furthermore  should any commercial undertaking by us prove to be successful  there can be no assurance competitors with greater financial resources will not offer competitive products and or technologies 
we rely on outside sources for various components and processes for our products 
we rely on third parties for various components and processes for our products 
while we try to have at least two sources for each component and process  we may not be able to achieve multiple sourcing because there may be no acceptable second source  other companies may choose not to work with us  or the component or process sought may be so new that a second source does not exist  or does not exist on acceptable terms 
in addition  due to the recent tightening of global credit and the disruption in the financial markets  there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third party contractors  suppliers or collaborators 
if such third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us  our business would be adversely affected 
therefore  it is possible that our business plans will have to be slowed down or stopped completely at times due to our inability to obtain required raw materials  components and outsourced processes at an acceptable cost  if at all  or to get a timely response from vendors 
we must overcome the many obstacles associated with integrating and operating varying business ventures to succeed 
our model to integrate and oversee the strategic direction of various subsidiaries and research and development projects presents many risks  including the difficulty of integrating operations and personnel  and the diversion of our management s attention as a result of evaluating  negotiating and integrating acquisitions or new business ventures 
if we are unable to timely and efficiently design and integrate administrative and operational support for our subsidiaries  we may be unable to manage projects effectively  which could adversely affect our ability to meet our business objectives and the value of an investment in the company could decline 
in addition  consummating acquisitions and taking advantage of strategic relationships could adversely impact our cash position  and dilute stockholder interests  for many reasons  including changes to our income to reflect the amortization of acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  interest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred to fund our growth strategy  and any issuance of securities to fund our operations or growth  which dilutes or lessens the rights of current stockholders 
our success depends on the attraction and retention of senior management and scientists with relevant expertise 
our future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued services of our key employees 
in addition  we rely on several key executives to manage each of our subsidiaries 
we do not maintain key man life insurance for any of our executives 
our ability to execute our strategy also will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientists  sales  marketing and additional managerial personnel 
if we are unable to find  hire and retain qualified individuals  we could have difficulty implementing our business plan in a timely manner  or at all 
given the company s current financial constraints  we may need to terminate additional employees  including senior management and technical employees  or such employees may seek other employment 
with these and past reductions  it is possible that valuable know how will be lost and that development efforts could be negatively affected 
members of our senior management team and board may have a conflict of interest in also serving as officers and or directors of our subsidiaries 
while we expect that our officers and directors who also serve as officers and or directors of our subsidiaries will comply with their fiduciary duties owed to our stockholders  they may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and the minority stockholders of our subsidiaries 
specifically  dr 
anzalone  our ceo and president  is the founder  ceo and a board member of each of nanotope  inc nanotope  a regenerative medicine company that is separately financed in which the company owns a interest  and leonardo biosystems  inc leonardo  a drug delivery company that is separately financed in which the company owns a interest 
dr 
anzalone owns a minority interest in the stock of each of nanotope and leonardo 
to the extent that any of our directors choose to recuse themselves from particular board actions to avoid a conflict of interest  the other members of our board of directors will have a greater influence on such decisions 

table of contents our efforts pertaining to the pharmaceutical industry are subject to additional risks 
our subsidiaries  calando and tego  as well as minority investments nanotope and leonardo  are focused on technology related to new and improved pharmaceutical candidates 
drug development is time consuming  expensive and risky 
even product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development  such as in early animal and human clinical trials  often fail to reach the market for a number of reasons  such as clinical trial results are not acceptable  even though preclinical trial results were promising  inefficacy and or harmful side effects in humans or animals  the necessary regulatory bodies  such as the us food and drug administration  did not approve our potential product for the intended use  and manufacturing and distribution is uneconomical 
clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists  medical personnel  regulatory personnel  statisticians and others  which often delays  limits  or prevents further clinical development or regulatory approvals of potential products 
if the subsidiaries technology is not cost effective or if the associated drug products do not achieve wide market acceptance  the value of a subsidiary would be materially and adversely affected 
any drugs developed by our subsidiaries may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations  third party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives  thereby harming our business 
increasing expenditures for healthcare have been the subject of considerable public attention in the us both private and government entities are seeking ways to reduce or contain healthcare costs 
numerous proposals that would affect changes in the us healthcare system have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures  including reductions in the cost of prescription products and changes in the levels at which consumers and healthcare providers are reimbursed for purchases of pharmaceutical products 
the ability of calando  tego and our minority investments nanotope and leonardo to market products successfully either on their own or in partnership with other companies will depend in part on the extent to which third party payers are willing to reimburse patients for the costs of their products and related treatments 
these third party payers include government authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as health maintenance organizations 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
in addition  the trend toward managed healthcare and government insurance programs could result in lower prices and reduced demand for the products of these companies 
cost containment measures instituted by healthcare providers and any general healthcare reform could affect their ability to sell products and may have a material adverse effect on them  thereby diminishing the value of the company s interest in these subsidiaries or any anticipated milestone or royalty payments 
we cannot predict the effect of future legislation or regulation concerning the healthcare industry and third party coverage and reimbursement on our business 
there may be a difference in the investment valuations that we used when making initial and subsequent investments in our subsidiaries and minority investments and actual market values 
our investments in our subsidiaries and minority interests were the result of negotiation with subsidiary management and equity holders  and the investment valuations were not independently verified 
traditional methods used by independent valuation analysts include a discounted cash flow analysis and a comparable company analysis 
we have not generated a positive cash flow to date and do not expect to generate significant cash flow in the near future 
additionally  we believe that there exist comparable public companies to provide a meaningful valuation comparison 
accordingly  we have not sought independent valuation analysis in connection with our investments and may have invested in our various holdings at higher or lower valuations than an independent source would have recommended 
there may be no correlation between the investment valuations that we used over the years for our investments and the actual market values 
if we should eventually sell all or a part of any of our consolidated business or that of a subsidiary  the ultimate sale price may be for a value substantially lower or higher than previously determined by us  which could materially and adversely impair the value of our common stock 
risks related to our intellectual property if unidym is unable to raise additional cash or pay its debts  unidym may lose rights to critical intellectual property 
unidym is required to meet certain financial covenants pursuant to the rice university license agreement unidym acquired upon its acquisition of cni 
when unidym acquired cni  cni possessed intellectual property rights concerning carbon nanotubes that it had licensed from rice university 
the rice license includes financial covenants tested quarterly for compliance 
if unidym fails to meet the financial covenants  the rice license automatically terminates 
if this should happen  the value of unidym s intellectual property portfolio would be significantly and adversely affected and unidym would likely lose patent protection for its products and licensing opportunities for the majority of its cnt intellectual portfolio 

table of contents our ability to protect our patents and other proprietary rights is uncertain  exposing us to the possible loss of competitive advantage 
our subsidiaries have licensed rights to pending patents and have filed and will continue to file patent applications 
the researchers sponsored by us may also file patent applications that we choose to license 
if a particular patent is not granted  the value of the invention described in the patent would be diminished 
further  even if these patents are granted  they may be difficult to enforce 
even if successful  efforts to enforce our patent rights could be expensive  distracting for management  cause our patents to be invalidated  and frustrate commercialization of products 
additionally  even if patents are issued and are enforceable  others may independently develop similar  superior or parallel technologies to any technology developed by us  or our technology may prove to infringe upon patents or rights owned by others 
thus  the patents held by or licensed to us may not afford us any meaningful competitive advantage 
if we are unable to derive value from our licensed or owned intellectual property  the value of your investment may decline 
our ability to develop and commercialize products will depend on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to develop and commercialize products based on their respective patent portfolios  will depend  in part  on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to enforce those patents and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance that any patents that may issue from patent applications owned or licensed by us or any of our subsidiaries will provide sufficient protection to conduct our respective businesses as presently conducted or as proposed to be conducted  or that we or our subsidiaries will remain free from infringement claims by third parties 
we may be subject to patent infringement claims  which could result in substantial costs and liability and prevent us from commercializing our potential products 
because the nanotechnology intellectual property landscape is rapidly evolving and interdisciplinary  it is difficult to conclusively assess our freedom to operate without infringing on third party rights 
however  we are currently aware of certain patent rights held by third parties that  if found to be valid and enforceable  could be alleged to render one or more of our business lines infringing 
if a claim should be brought and is successful  we may be required to pay substantial damages  be forced to abandon any affected business lines and or seek a license from the patent holder 
in addition  any patent infringement claims brought against us or our subsidiaries  whether or not successful  may cause us to incur significant expenses and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from other business concerns 
these could negatively affect our results of operations and prospects 
there can also be no assurance that patents owned or licensed by us or our subsidiaries will not be challenged by others 
in addition  if our potential products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  these third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers  and we may be required to indemnify our customers for any damages they suffer as a result of these claims 
the claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of customers  regardless of the merits of these claims 
if any of these claims succeed  we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use 
if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  we may be unable to continue selling such products 
the technology licensed by our subsidiaries from various third parties may be subject to government rights and retained rights of the originating research institutions 
we license technology from caltech  rice university  and other universities and companies 
our licensors may have obligations to government agencies or universities 
under their agreements  a government agency or university may obtain certain rights over the technology that we have developed and licensed  including the right to require that a compulsory license be granted to one or more third parties selected by the government agency 
in addition  our collaborators often retain certain rights under their agreements with us  including the right to use the underlying technology for noncommercial academic and research use  to publish general scientific findings from research related to the technology  and to make customary scientific and scholarly disclosures of information relating to the technology 
it is difficult to monitor whether our collaborators limit their use of the technology to these uses  and we could incur substantial expenses to enforce our rights to our licensed technology in the event of misuse 
risks related to regulation of our products our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations 
our operations  including our research and development and our commercialization efforts  such as clinical trials  manufacturing and distribution  are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program  we cannot assure you that the company or our employees are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations or laws 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations or laws  a range of actions could result  including  but not limited to  the termination of clinical trials  the failure to approve a commercialized product  significant fines  sanctions  or litigation  any of which could harm our business and financial condition 

table of contents if export controls affecting our products are expanded  our business will be adversely affected 
the federal government regulates the sale and shipment of numerous technologies by us companies to foreign countries 
our subsidiaries may develop products that might be useful for military and antiterrorism activities 
accordingly  federal government export regulations could restrict sales of these products in other countries 
if the federal government places burdensome export controls on our technology or products  our business would be materially and adversely affected 
if the federal government determines that we have not complied with the applicable export regulations  we may face penalties in the form of fines or other punishment 
risks related to our stock stockholder equity interest may be substantially diluted in any additional financing 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock  on such terms and at such prices as our board of directors may determine 
as of september    shares of common stock and no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding 
as of september    shares and  shares were reserved for issuance upon exercise of options granted under our stock option plan  the plan  and equity incentive plan  the plan  respectively 
as of september   we had warrants outstanding to purchase  shares of common stock and issued warrants to purchase  shares in a recent private offering 
all of the warrants are callable by us under certain market conditions 
in october  the stockholders approved an increase in the number of the authorized shares of common stock from million to million under our certificate of incorporation see footnote subsequent events in the attached financials 
the increase in authorized shares of common stock approved by our stockholders  together with the issuance of additional securities in financing transactions by us or through the exercise of options or warrants will dilute the equity interests of our existing stockholders  perhaps substantially  and might result in dilution in the tangible net book value of a share of our common stock  depending upon the price and other terms on which the additional shares are issued 
our common stock price has fluctuated significantly over the last several years and may continue to do so in the future  without regard to our results of operations and prospects 
because we are a development stage company  there are few objective metrics by which our progress may be measured 
consequently  we expect that the market price of our common stock will likely continue to fluctuate significantly 
we do not expect to generate substantial revenue from the license or sale of our nanotechnology for several years  if at all 
in the absence of product revenue as a measure of our operating performance  we anticipate that investors and market analysts will assess our performance by considering factors such as announcements of developments related to our business  developments in our strategic relationships with scientists within the nanotechnology field  our ability to enter into or extend investigation phase  development phase  commercialization phase and other agreements with new and or existing partners  announcements regarding the status of any or all of our collaborations or products  market perception and or investor sentiment regarding nanotechnology as the next technological wave  announcements regarding developments in the nanotechnology field in general  the issuance of competitive patents or disallowance or loss of our patent rights  and quarterly variations in our operating results 
we will not have control over many of these factors but expect that they may influence our stock price 
as a result  our stock price may be volatile and any extreme fluctuations in the market price of our common stock could result in the loss of all or part of your investment 
the market for purchases and sales of our common stock may be very limited  and the sale of a limited number of shares could cause the price to fall sharply 
although our common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq capital market  our securities are currently relatively thinly traded 
our current solvency concerns could serve to exacerbate the thin trading of our securities 
for example  mandatory sales of our common stock by institutional holders could be triggered if an investment in our common stock no longer satisfies their investment standards and guidelines as a result of the solvency concerns 
accordingly  it may be difficult to sell shares of common stock quickly without significantly depressing the value of the stock 
unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock  sales of our stock could continue to result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock 
moreover  our stock price has generally been declining for the last months 

table of contents if securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports about our business or if they make adverse recommendations regarding an investment in our stock  our stock price and trading volume may decline 
the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our business 
we do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by industry or securities analysts 
investors have many investment opportunities and may limit their investments to companies that receive coverage from analysts 
if no industry or securities analysts commence coverage of the company  the trading price of our stock could be negatively impacted 
in the event we obtain industry or security analyst coverage  if one or more of the analysts downgrade our stock or comment negatively on our prospects  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts cease to cover our industry or us or fails to publish reports about the company regularly  our common stock could lose visibility in the financial markets  which could also cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 
the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by the sale of shares by our management or founding stockholders 
sales of our common stock by our officers  directors and founding stockholders could adversely and unpredictably affect the price of those securities 
additionally  the price of our common stock could be affected even by the potential for sales by these persons 
we cannot predict the effect that any future sales of our common stock  or the potential for those sales  will have on our share price 
furthermore  due to relatively low trading volume of our stock  should one or more large stockholders seek to sell a significant portion of its stock in a short period of time  the price of our stock may decline 
we may be the target of securities class action litigation due to future stock price volatility 
in the past  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have often initiated securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management 
we do not intend to declare cash dividends on our common stock 
we will not distribute cash to our stockholders unless and until we can develop sufficient funds from operations to meet our ongoing needs and implement our business plan 
the time frame for that is inherently unpredictable  and you should not plan on it occurring in the near future  if at all 
our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of blank check preferred stock  which may make an acquisition of the company by another company more difficult 
we have adopted and may in the future adopt certain measures that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a takeover or other change in control of the company that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
specifically  our board of directors  without further action by our stockholders  currently has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights including voting rights  preferences and privileges of these shares blank check preferred 
such preferred stock may have rights  including economic rights  senior to our common stock 
additionally  because we are effectively out of authorized by unissued common stock  we may be forced to issue preferred stock in future capital raising transactions 
as a result  the issuance of the preferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock

arrowhead owns two majority owned subsidiaries  unidym and calando  three wholly owned non operating subsidiaries and has minority investments in two early stage nanotechnology companies  nanotope and leonardo 
arrowhead s business plan includes adding to its portfolio through selective acquisition and formation of new companies  as capital resources allow 
the company s subsidiaries are seeking to commercialize or license the technology covering a variety of nanotechnology products and applications  including anti cancer rnai therapeutics  carbon based electronics and fullerene based anti oxidants 
the company s minority investments are focused on developing advanced nanomaterials for spinal cord injury and wound healing and drug delivery technology 
arrowhead has been active in the operation of its subsidiaries  providing key management functions 
during  the company continued its efforts to streamline the operations of arrowhead and its subsidiaries to increase efficiency and decrease costs while continuing to move the business plans of each entity forward 
with the decision to move to a licensing model for calando and the decision to reduce costs at unidym  the amount of cash needed to fund both operations is expected to be reduced from historical levels 

table of contents cash resources and going concern at september   the company had approximately million in cash to fund operations 
in fiscal  the company raised million in capital and million through the sales of assets  products and license fees  on a consolidated basis  through equity financing at the arrowhead level and sales of equity and convertible loans by its subsidiaries

based on this financing  the company has developed a plan which indicates that the company has sufficient cash to operate through september  majority owned subsidiaries unidym unidym is a leader in carbon nanotube based transparent  conductive films tcfs for the electronics industry 
tcfs are a critical component in devices such as touch panels  displays  and thin film solar cells 
for example  both touch panels and lcds typically employ two tcf layers per device 
unidym s tcfs offer substantial advantages over the incumbent technology  indium based metal oxides  including improved durability  lower processing costs  and lower overall cost structure 
unidym is working in close collaboration with customers  especially in asia where the bulk of display manufacturing is located 
unidym is initially focused on the touch panel market and expects modest revenue from sales of its films in the near term 
in fiscal  unidym reduced costs and liabilities and restructured operations 
during the year  headcount was reduced and unidym s facilities were consolidated in sunnyvale  california 
in line with its strategy to work with manufacturing partners  in may  unidym transferred a portion of its assets for cnt production to ccni  a manufacturer of cnts and carbon black  and is in the process of negotiating a license and supply agreement with ccni for the production of unidym s cnt supply needs 
the consideration for the assets to be transferred and licenses to be granted in the license and supply agreement is still being negotiated  but is expected to consist of upfront payments and royalties 
in november  unidym raised million through the sale of series c preferred stock to tokyo electron ventures tel ventures 
since march  unidym s operations have been funded by arrowhead through a series of stock purchases 
arrowhead also increased its ownership through acquisition of stock from minority holders in unidym  including tel ventures

unidym requires additional capital to fund its operations and obligations through fiscal unidym s cash consumption has been reduced from fiscal levels of million to million per quarter to  in the fourth fiscal quarter of from september  to september   unidym s liabilities have been reduced from to million 
the development  production and sale of unidym s products have required and are expected to continue to require significant investment and to take a long time 
there are a variety of technical  cost  and marketing barriers that must be overcome 
it is not possible at this time to predict the final cost of developing unidym s transparent conductive film or other cnt products  the final cost of scaling up the production process  when or if unidym will generate significant licensing revenue  or when or if unidym will become profitable 

table of contents calando calando is a clinical stage oncology drug delivery company 
calando has developed proprietary technologies to create targeted sirna based therapeutics and small molecule nanoparticle drug conjugates 
calando s innovative cyclosert and rondel nanoparticle systems have been designed to solve the long standing obstacle of safe and effective delivery and targeting for oligonucleotide and small molecule therapeutics 
calando has developed two clinical stage drug candidates for the treatment of cancer 
calaa  a therapeutic candidate based on sirna and the rondel system  is currently undergoing a phase i clinical study 
the trial is utilizing a dose escalation protocol which is nearing the highest dose in the protocol and yielding recent promising results 
calando plans to complete the phase i trial  as capital resources allow  and is seeking a partner for the further development of both the sirna delivery platform and calaa the other clinical candidate is it  a conjugate of calando s delivery molecule and the potent small molecule anti cancer drug  camptothecin 
it has completed a phase i clinical trial with a positive safety profile and indications of efficacy 
on june   calando entered into agreements to license its small molecule delivery platform and it  to cerulean pharma  inc cerulean  a boston  ma based biotech company 
under the terms of the agreements  calando granted cerulean an exclusive royalty bearing worldwide license to certain patent rights and know how and transferred to cerulean certain intellectual property related to the linear cyclodextrin drug delivery platform and it in exchange for an initial payment of million 
under the agreements  calando retains the rights to use the linear cyclodextrin drug delivery platform to deliver tubulysin  cytolysin the rights to deliver both were previously sublicensed by calando to r d biopharmaceuticals gmbh  second generation epothilones  as well as any kind of nucleic acid  eg  a dna or sirna therapeutics 
as such  calando retains the rights to its rondel tm platform  as well as the calaa and calaa lead drugs 
in connection with the cerulean agreements  calando closed its phase clinical studies for it the million payment from cerulean was used to pay down calando s existing obligations 
under the terms of the agreements  cerulean will pay calando up to million in development milestone payments if it progresses through clinical trials and receives marketing approval 
if approved  calando is also entitled to receive up to an additional million in sales milestones  plus royalties on net sales  depending on sales levels  with any development milestone payments credited against such royalties 
for every new drug candidate that cerulean is able to bring to market with the linear cyclodextrin drug delivery platform  calando is entitled to receive up to million in development milestone payments and up to an additional million in sales milestones  plus royalties on annual net sales  depending on sales levels  with any development milestone payments credited against such royalties 
in addition  should cerulean enter into any sublicense agreements for the development and sale of it  calando is entitled to to of cerulean s sublicense income  depending on timing of the underlying sublicensing deal 
historically  calando chose to finance the development of drug candidates and its platform systems from its own resources and minority investments 
significant cash was consumed in fiscal and in the first three quarters of fiscal for calando s clinical program and the development of a second sirna therapeutic 
calando has moved from an internal development strategy to a partnership and licensing model 
in line with this strategy  calando phased down its operations significantly in the first half of fiscal as part of the company s overall cash conservation strategy and closed its laboratory facility on june  two employees were transferred to arrowhead to manage the calaa clinical study and facilitate partnership negotiations 
since july  calando has further reduced expenses except for limited expenses necessary to complete the calaa phase clinical study 
calando s cash consumption has been reduced from fiscal levels of million to million per quarter to less than  in the fourth fiscal quarter of calando s continuing cash needs are being met through a series of bridge loans from arrowhead 
calando will need significant additional capital to fund the completion of its phase trial and to pay its existing obligations 
we believe there is an opportunity to derive value from the further development of the calando platform drug delivery systems  as they have been demonstrated to enhance and enable the delivery of diverse pharmaceutical entities  including peptides and small molecules as well as other rna and dna based oligonucleotides 
at september   arrowhead s interest in calando was and on a fully diluted basis 
the development of calaa  it and other pipeline candidates are preliminary  and there is no assurance that they will be successful 
there are numerous technical  regulatory and marketing challenges that must be overcome to successfully commercialize calando s products  including  but not limited to the following advancing pipeline candidates requires extensive preclinical testing and approval by the us food and drug administration fda before clinical testing can commence 
advancing therapeutic candidates through preclinical and clinical testing is expensive  resource intensive and time consuming 
complications may arise that would cause the clinical testing to be interrupted or stopped 
fda approval is required before products can be sold 
even if fda approval is eventually obtained  there is no assurance that it will be accepted by the medical community 
it is not possible at this time to accurately determine the final cost of the development projects  the completion dates  or when or if revenue will commence 

table of contents wholly owned subsidiaries tego tego has been pursuing a licensing and partnering strategy 
in line with this strategy  on july   tego exclusively licensed to the bronx project  inc tbp  a development stage pharmaceutical company  the rights to develop and commercialize carboxylated fullerenes  eg  the fullerene c  in the fields of parkinson s disease  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or lou gehrig s disease  multiple sclerosis  brain trauma and schizophrenia 
the tbp license provides tego with  in upfront fees  million in potential milestone payments and royalties  as well as of the proceeds of a sale of tbp itself to a third party 
agonn as part of arrowhead s strategy to conserve cash in  agonn curtailed its development efforts 
at september   agonn had no facilities or employees and is managed by arrowhead 
masa energy llc masa s only assets are a minority position in nanotope  inc nanotope and a minority position in leonardo biosystems  inc lbs 
minority investments nanotope  inc nanotope is an early stage nano biotechnology company developing advanced materials for regeneration and wound healing 
arrowhead owns of nanotope and accounts for its investment in nanotope using the equity method of accounting 
in fiscal  arrowhead recorded a loss of  representing its interest in nanotope s loss 
nanotope is positioned to enter into a commercialization corporate partnership in and expects to be able to start a first round of clinical trials in nanotope s model is to partner product candidates prior to clinical trials and  therefore  assume no clinical costs 
nanotope was co founded by dr

arrowhead has a interest in leonardo and accounts for its  investment in leonardo using the cost method of accounting 
leonardo expects to enter into commercial development partnerships in leonardo was co founded by dr 
anzalone  the company s ceo  prior to his employment by arrowhead 
dr 
anzalone  through his ownership in the benet group  owns of the outstanding stock of leonardo and he serves as the ceo of leonardo 
academic partnerships in prior years  arrowhead devoted significant capital resources to sponsored research 
as the subsidiaries have matured  the company has decreased its reliance on sponsored research for technology development and sponsored research expense has decreased 
as of september   unidym had one active sponsored research agreement at duke university 
negotiations with duke to reduce the scope of the sponsored research project are expected to reduce the cost to approximately  per year 
depending on capital resources  arrowhead and or its subsidiaries expect to continue to invest in nanoscience research and development through sponsored research agreements at universities 
factors affecting further r d expenses since early fiscal  the company has dramatically decreased its research and development expenses due to cash constraints 
research and development expenses are expected to fluctuate in the foreseeable future as the company s product development efforts move through various phases of development and as capital resources allow 
each phase of development requires different resources 
also  the pace of development can affect the resources required 
over the past five years  the company has increased and decreased subsidiaries and products in its pipeline  increased and decreased research and development personnel  engineers  business development and marketing personnel  expanded and contracted its pre clinical research  begun and ended clinical trial activities  increased its regulatory compliance capabilities  and purchased capital equipment and laboratory supplies 
the timing and amount of these fluctuations in expenses is difficult to predict due to the uncertainty inherent in the timing and extent of progress in the company s research programs 
as the company s research efforts evolve  it will continue to review the direction of its research based on an assessment of the value of possible commercial applications emerging from these efforts 
in addition to these general factors  specific factors that will determine the eventual cost to complete the current projects at arrowhead s nano biotechnology subsidiaries or their partners and potential partners include the following the number  size and duration of clinical trials required to gain fda approval  
table of contents the costs of producing supplies of the drug candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions  the efficacy and safety profile of the drug candidate  and the costs and timing of  and the ability to secure  regulatory approvals 
it is possible that the completion of studies could be delayed for a variety of reasons  including difficulties in enrolling patients  delays in manufacturing  incomplete or inconsistent data from the pre clinical or clinical trials  difficulties evaluating the trial results and lack of funding 
any delay in completion of a trial would increase the cost of that trial 
due to these uncertainties  the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or timing of cash inflows from calando s current activities 
critical accounting policies and estimates management makes certain judgments and uses certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources

results of operations the company had a consolidated loss of approximately million for the year ended september   compared to a consolidated loss of million for the year ended september  
table of contents the decrease in the fiscal consolidated loss over fiscal is the result of a number of factors 
the number of management and staff employees at arrowhead declined over fiscal and other cost savings measures were instituted  including the closure of arrowhead s new york office and reduction in scientific advisory fees 
it is expected that the trend to consolidate management of the subsidiaries at arrowhead will continue with the goal of reducing cash outlay throughout the company 
unidym also reduced its expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  unidym was pursuing a business plan based on building a vertically integrated company that would manufacture both carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotube films 
with the dramatic changes in economic conditions in late  unidym decided to look to partners for manufacturing capability rather than expand its internal capabilities 
in line with this strategy  unidym closed its texas operations in january this resulted in a reduction in workforce and other expenses related to the operation of the texas plant and a reduction in lease expenses later in the year 
unidym consolidated its northern california operations into one facility in and also decreased the number of management and technical staff in the early part of the year 
significant expense is expected to be incurred in the further development of unidym s products 
however  development costs at unidym have been substantially reduced and the pace of development will depend on the cash resources and partnership opportunities available to unidym 
calando also reduced expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a change in business strategy 
rather than bear the significant expense of running multiple clinical trials  calando decided to seek partners for further development of its technology 
beginning in fiscal and continuing into fiscal  calando reduced its management and technical staff culminating with the closure of its lab facility in pasadena  california in june fiscal after a partnership for one of its drug delivery technologies and its associated clinical candidate was signed 
calando s outside lab and contract services expense decreased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal calando incurred major expenses during fiscal related to the it clinical trial and preparation for a phase clinical trial for calaa with the initiation of the phase i trial for calaa in fiscal  the need to incur outside labs and contract service expenses was reduced 
in fiscal  significant expense was incurred for manufacture of the components for calaa  preparation for an ind for calaa and the continuation of calando s clinical trials 
continued clinical and preclinical development of calando s drug candidates will depend on the cash resources available to calando 
development expenses related to agonn and tego were minimal in fiscal compared to fiscal revenues the company generated revenues of  and  for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the revenue for the year ended september  consists of a license fee of  related to the license of calando s it to cerulean  sale of approximately  in it inventory to cerulean   from grants to fund research for the development of carbon nanotube applications   from license fees applicable to unidym technology   from the sale and delivery of carbon nanotubes to third parties and  of collaboration services revenue 
the revenue for the year ended september  consists of  from grants to fund research for the development of carbon nanotube applications   from license fees from unidym technology  and  from the sale and delivery of carbon nanotubes to third parties 
revenues from sales of carbon nanotubes are expected to decline in as unidym depletes its inventories and transfers its bulk carbon nanotube production to a third party in exchange for payments based on the third party sales 
unidym is anticipating modest revenue from film sales in fiscal operating expenses the analysis below details the operating expenses and discusses the expenditures of the company within the major expense categories 
for purposes of comparison  the amounts for the years ended september  and are shown in the table below 
salary wage expenses fiscal compared to fiscal arrowhead employs management  administrative and technical staff at the arrowhead corporate offices and the subsidiaries 
salary and wage expense consists of salary  benefits  and non cash charges related to equity based compensation in the form of stock options 
salary and benefits are allocated to two major categories general and administrative compensation related expense and research and development compensation related expense depending on the primary activities of each employee 
the following table details salary and related expenses for fiscal and fiscal in thousands year ended september  of expense category year ended september  of expense category g a compensation related stock based compensation r d compensation related total 
table of contents in fiscal  general and administrative g a compensation expense decreased due to a reduction of accrued severance pursuant to an amendment to the severance agreement between the company and the executive chairman  such that  in the event his employment with the company terminates  he would receive a lump sum payment equal to one month s salary rather than months salary 
this change resulted in a reduction of g a compensation related expense in fiscal as well as a reduction in the accrued severance liability on the company s balance sheet from  as of september  to approximately  at september  g a compensation expense would have been approximately million without this adjustment 
also  the company reduced the number of employees across all its entities during fiscal in fiscal  management positions were added at arrowhead including a chief executive officer in december beginning in fiscal and increasingly in  the cost of the new positions at arrowhead was offset by the termination of several senior management positions at the subsidiaries  as well as several members of the administrative staff 
the responsibilities of the terminated employees have been absorbed by arrowhead management  administrative and finance personnel or other employees at unidym 
the company expects to continue to run at a salary rate which will result in lower g a compensation expense in fiscal the decrease in g a salaries also includes the impact of the salary reductions for selected management and staff at arrowhead and unidym 
stock based compensation is a non cash charge related to the issuance and vesting of stock options to new and existing employees 
this expense is recorded pursuant to guidance by the fasb  which requires expensing of stock based compensation for vested options 
stock options are awarded to new full time employees and to existing employees 
during the fiscal year  the number of options outstanding decreased as a result of options being canceled following terminations 
also  in july   options issued to officers  directors and selected employees were cancelled to facilitate a financing by the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal in return  the vesting schedule for certain recent stock option grants for officers  directors and employees was accelerated 
as a result  the expense applicable to those options was accelerated causing an increase to stock based compensation expense of approximately  for fiscal in october  a special meeting of the stockholders was held and the number of authorized shares of common stock was increased to million shares 
the stockholders also authorized the board of directors to make a grant of stock options to purchase  shares of common stock by officers  directors and employees of the company who agreed to forfeit their stock options to facilitate the financing 
the number of options outstanding and the option expense will vary from period to period depending on hiring  terminations and awards to new and existing employees 
research and development r d compensation expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to unidym s reduction in research scientists and process engineers and the closure of unidym s texas facility 
calando has also reduced laboratory personnel in connection with its decision in june to license its technology and close its laboratory facility 
two employees have been retained and moved to arrowhead to complete the calaa clinical study and to facilitate the partnership arrangements for calando s technology 
on a consolidated basis  the company expects that the salaries and wages expense will continue to decrease compared to the prior year as a result of recent reductions in headcount and salaries throughout the organization 
general administrative expenses fiscal compared to fiscal the following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended september  and in thousands year ended september  of expense category year ended september  of expense category professional outside services recruiting facilities related patent expense travel expense business insurance depreciation g a communications and technology office expense others total professional outside services include general legal  accounting and other outside services retained by the company and its subsidiaries 
all periods include normally occurring legal and accounting expenses related to sec compliance and other corporate matters 
however  the majority of this expense was related to financing for the company  which was a significant activity in fiscal and is expected to continue in fiscal 
table of contents recruiting expense was very low in fiscal compared to fiscal as the company was reducing executive staff and consolidating management of the subsidiaries at arrowhead rather than recruiting for these positions 
facilities and related expense were fairly constant during fiscal compared to fiscal but are expected to be substantially reduced in fiscal due to the closing of a number of facilities 
arrowhead s new york office was closed on april  the company was obligated to pay the base rent on the office through the lease term ending on december   but realized savings related to incidental expenses previously incurred by the operation of the new york office from april through november 
calando closed its laboratory operations and returned the space to the landlord on july  unidym s leases in texas were terminated and unidym has consolidated its operations into one facility in sunnyvale  california 
patent expense decreased in fiscal as a result of arrowhead employing a chief patent officer whose salary was accounted for in g a compensation related expense  from april through august to manage the patent portfolio 
this reduced use of outside patent counsel resulted in decreased patent activity by calando and unidym 
certain calando patents that are not being utilized were returned to caltech which also reduced the ongoing patent expense 
the company expects to continue to invest in patent protection as the company extends and maintains protection for its current portfolios and files new patent applications as its product applications are improved 
the cost will vary depending on the needs of the company 
travel expense includes recurring expenses related to travel by company personnel to and from company locations in pasadena  northern california  and new york city 
travel expense is also incurred as the company pursues business initiatives and collaborations throughout the world with other companies and for marketing  investor relations  fund raising and public relations purposes 
with the closing of operations in houston  texas  the reduction of calando s operations and with the company and subsidiaries reducing travel to conserve cash  the company expects travel expense to continue to decrease in fiscal however  travel expense fluctuates from year to year depending on current projects 
insurance expense has decreased due to generally lower rates in insurance markets and a steep reduction in coverage for clinical trials with the termination of the phase clinical study for it this expense is expected to fluctuate but eventually decrease as a result of changes in the market and the status of clinical trials and the reduction in number of facilities at unidym requiring insurance 
the decrease in office expense and communications and technology expense is primarily related to the closing of the texas facility and to the reduction in employees 
research and development expenses fiscal compared to fiscal most of arrowhead s r d expenses for fiscal and fiscal were related to research and development activities by arrowhead s subsidiaries 
the following table details r d expenses for fiscal and in thousands year ended september  of expense category year ended september  of expense category outside labs contract services license  royalty milestones in process r d purchased laboratory supplies services facilities related sponsored research depreciation r d other research expenses total the decrease in outside labs contract services for fiscal was a result of the advanced state of the it phase clinical trial  the decision to close the it phase clinical trials in connection with the agreement with cerulean for further development of it  completion of preparatory work for the calaa phase clinical trial  and the suspension of development efforts for calaa during fiscal  process development and preclinical expenses for calando s drug candidate calaa  together with the clinical trial expenses for calaa phase i and it phase i and ii totaled approximately million 
however  the expenses were significantly reduced by june  when the calando facility was closed 
the fiscal expenses include the outsourced preclinical studies in preparation for the inda filing for phase i of calaa  outsourced manufacture of components for calaa for clinical studies and tego s outsourced preclinical studies million 
also in fiscal  unidym incurred expenses for outside lab and contract services were about million 
the current year outside lab contract services expense also include approximately  attributable to agonn s prototype development efforts 
with the decision to close the laboratory of calando and to license the drug delivery platforms  the cost related to outside labs and contract services is expected to decrease in fiscal calando expects to incur limited expenses to complete the calaa trial and seek an appropriate development partner 

table of contents in fiscal  purchased in process r d expense resulted from the exchange of arrowhead stock for unidym stock 
as a result of these exchanges  arrowhead increased its ownership in unidym to 
the purchased in process research and development expense equals the estimated fair value of the arrowhead stock issued to purchase unidym shares from unidym s minority shareholders 
arrowhead s purchase of the unidym shares is accounted for as an additional investment in subsidiaries by arrowhead 
however  the additional investment by arrowhead does not result in a corresponding increase in unidym s asset or capital accounts 
the additional investment is expensed in consolidation as purchased in process research and development in accordance with guidance by the fasb 
this determination was made in light of the risks inherent in the technical development and the uncertainty of acceptance of unidym s products 
unidym s r d expenses are also declining as a result of streamlining its r d effort and the closure of its production facility in texas 
unidym continues to focus on the production and sale of cnt based inks and is seeking to establish partnerships for both cnt production and coating of film 
outside laboratory contract services expenses will continue to fluctuate depending upon where a particular project is in its development  approval or trial process 
licensing fees  milestones and royalties consist primarily of amounts paid by unidym under the terms of its license agreement with rice university and calando for the license for sirna targets from alnylam 
this expense decreased because arrowhead has completed several sponsored research agreements 
laboratory supplies and services consist primarily of materials  supplies and services consumed in the laboratory 
with the closing of calando s lab and the scale down of unidym operations  this expense is expected to dramatically decrease in fiscal facilities related expenses increased for fiscal over the prior year period primarily due to the addition of facilities in houston  texas and in sunnyvale  california for unidym 
relocation of the menlo park operations to the larger sunnyvale  california location is complete and both leases for facilities in texas have been terminated 
the calando laboratory facility was closed on june  facility related expenses are expected to decrease as a result of the reduction in the number of leased facilities 
sponsored research expense decreased for the year ended september  compared to the prior year  as projects were completed university of florida or terminated caltech 
no new research projects were added during fiscal the only sponsored research agreement currently in place is unidym s agreement with duke university 
the table below sets forth the approximate amount of arrowhead s cash expenses for research and development projects at each subsidiary for the periods described below 
name of subsidiary project project expenses for year ended september  project expenses for year ended september  project expenses from inception of project through september  calando pharmaceuticals  inc calaa it million million million unidym  inc thin film carbon nanotubes million million million tego biosciences corp 
fullerene anti oxidants million million million agonn systems  inc fullerene anti oxidants million million million total of all listed subsidiaries million million million consulting for fiscal  consulting fees and related travel totaled approximately  total consulting fees included  for calando and  for unidym 
consulting fees in fiscal were substantially reduced from those incurred in fiscal for calando  the reduction reflects the decision to reduce cash outflows in light of the company s cash balances 
with the closure of the phase trial for it and its ultimate licensing to a third party for development  consulting for clinical studies is expected to continue to show a dramatic decrease in fiscal the consulting fees incurred by calando consisted of approximately  for clinical and regulatory consulting fees during fiscal compared to  for similar items in the same period in the prior year 
in fiscal  calando expects to complete its phase trial for calaa and due to the advanced stage of the trial  consulting fees for clinical and regulatory activity are expected to decline 
the current year consulting expense is related to administration of the various clinical trials in process while the prior year expenses relate to preclinical research  preparation for the filing of its inda with the fda 
the consulting fees incurred by unidym consisted of  for consulting related to the process to manufacture sheets of thin film nanotubes and performance testing of those sheets 
for the same period in the prior year  there was approximately  of consulting fees incurred in similar projects

the consulting fees incurred by calando included  for clinical and regulatory consulting fees 
the consulting fees incurred by unidym of  for consulting related to the process of manufacturing sheets of thin film nanotubes and performance testing of those sheets 

table of contents the use of consultants with diverse backgrounds enabled the company to accomplish various objectives without having to add full time staff and is expected to continue in fiscal leveraged technology and revenue strategy arrowhead continues to follow its strategy to leverage technology that is being or has been developed at universities 
by doing so  arrowhead benefits from work done at those universities and through majority owned subsidiaries  which can commercialize the most promising technologies developed from sponsored research and other sources 
the subsidiaries are likely to produce prototypes to advance their strategies 
the subsidiaries have three primary strategies to potentially generate product sales revenue license the products and processes to a third party for a royalty or other payment 
by licensing  the company would not be required to allocate resources to build a sales or a production infrastructure and could use those resources to develop additional products 
retain the rights to the products and processes  but contract with a third party for production 
the company would then market the finished products 
this approach would require either the establishment of a sales and distribution network or collaboration with a supplier who has an established sales and distribution network  but would not require investment in production equipment 
build production capability in order to produce and market the end products 
this last approach would likely require the most capital to build the production  sales and distribution infrastructure 
on a case by case basis  the company and each subsidiary will choose the strategy which  in the opinion of management  can be supported by available capital resources and is likely to generate the most favorable return 
while the ultimate goal of the company is to generate revenue through the sale of products and or the licensing of technology  the company does record revenue from grants and from development fees 
revenue from grants and development fees are considered to be reimbursements for efforts performed on behalf of third parties and not part of the company s primary strategy to generate revenue 
unidym generated revenues of  in fiscal with the transfer of carbon nanotube production and sales to ccni  revenues for carbon nanotube production  in fiscal are expected to decline in fiscal license fees for unidym technology added  to unidym s revenue in fiscal and grants added approximately  unidym generated combined revenues from grants and sales of carbon nanotubes totaling approximately  in fiscal unidym revenues for fiscal will likely decrease compared to prior years until the sale of conductive films generates meaningful revenue 
calando s revenue in fiscal was approximately  calando moved to a license model rather that an operating model at the end of the third quarter 
calando licensed its it platform and technology to cerulean generating  in license fees 
the sale of inventory for it to cerulean generated additional revenue of  while the license agreement calls for future revenue based on cerulean achieving certain milestones  the bulk of this potential revenue is not expected to commence in fiscal calando intends to license its calaa platform in fiscal calando also had  in collaborative services revenue in fiscal tego had  in revenue related to a license agreement in fiscal the company does not expect substantial product sales in fiscal therefore  losses can be expected to increase before any substantial revenue is generated 
to partially offset these losses  the company is pursuing other means of funding such as licenses  contracts and collaborations with third parties 
the award of such grants and contracts depends on numerous factors  many of which are not in the company s control and  therefore  it is difficult to predict if this strategy will be successful 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow position since inception in may  the company has incurred significant losses 
cash and cash equivalents decreased by million from million at september  to million at september  the company invests available cash in certificates of deposit  us government obligations and high grade commercial paper 
the company s investment objectives are primarily to preserve capital and liquidity and secondarily to obtain investment income 
arrowhead has historically financed its operation through the sale of securities of arrowhead and its subsidiaries 
in fiscal  the company obtained in cash through equity and debt financing  including million raised by calando through the sale of senior unsecured convertible promissory notes  and million raised by unidym through the sale of newly issued shares of series c preferred stock 
the company obtained an additional million from the sales of assets  products and license fees  including the sale by unidym of its equity interest in ensysce biosciences inc for  we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec covering the public sale by the company of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock 
if the company meets the market capital requirements in the future  it may seek to sell securities from this shelf registration statement to investors 

table of contents on december   the company executed definitive agreements for a private placement offering the offering with a selected group of accredited investors

management has developed a plan based upon the latest financing and other transactions which are expected to close in the near term 
the plan shows that the company has enough cash to fund operations through september  should a shortfall occur in expected cash receipts  the plan has contingencies to reduce expenditures in order to operate through september  the board has approved a strategy for the company to conserve cash and seek sources of new capital 
to execute this strategy  the board will seek to accomplish one or more of the following on favorable terms the out license of technology  sale of a subsidiary  sale of non core assets  scaling down development efforts  funded joint development or partnership arrangements  and sale of securities 
the probability that any of these events will occur is uncertain  especially in light of the lack of liquidity in the current capital and credit markets 
until such time as one or more of these goals is accomplished  the company has scaled back the activities at its subsidiaries 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments unidym incurred various contractual obligations and commercial commitments in connection with the acquisition of nanoconduction

patents and licenses our subsidiaries have entered into various licensing agreements requiring royalty payments of specified product sales 
some of these agreements contain provisions for the payment of guaranteed or minimum royalty amounts 
typically  the licensor can terminate our license if we fail to pay minimum annual royalties 
purchase commitments in connection with conducting phase ia and ib trials  in the normal course of business  calando incurred purchase obligations with vendors and suppliers for materials and supplies or for manufacture of therapeutic agents  as well as other goods and services 
these obligations are generally evidenced by purchase orders that contain the terms and conditions associated with the purchase arrangements 
calando is committed to accept delivery of such material pursuant to the purchase orders subject to various contract provisions which allow us to delay receipt of such orders or cancel orders beyond certain agreed upon lead times 
cancellations may result in cancellation costs payable by us 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have and have not had any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships
