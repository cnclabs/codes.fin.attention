item a 
risk factors an investment in harley davidson  inc involves risks  including those discussed below 
these risk factors should be considered carefully before deciding whether to invest in the company 
the company must effectively execute the company s restructuring plans within expected costs 
in january  the company announced a combination of restructuring actions that are designed to reduce excess capacity  exit non core business operations and lower the company s cost structure 
effectively executing these plans within expected costs and realizing expected benefits will depend upon a number of factors  including the time required to complete planned actions  effective collaboration and agreement with the company s union partners  the absence of material issues associated with workforce reductions  availability of and effective use of third party service providers to assist in implementing the actions  avoidance of unexpected disruptions in production  retention of key employees involved in implementing the restructuring plans and the ability of the company to sell or lease vacated facilities 

table of contents the company sells its products at wholesale and must rely on a network of independent dealers and distributors to manage the retail distribution of its products 
the company depends on the capability of its independent dealers and distributors to develop and implement effective retail sales plans to create demand among retail purchasers for the motorcycles and related products and services that the dealers and distributors purchase from the company 
if the company s independent dealers and distributors are not successful in these endeavors  then the company will be unable to maintain or grow its revenues and meet its financial expectations 
further  independent dealers and distributors may experience difficulty in funding their day to day cash flow needs and paying their obligations because of weakened retail sales and tightening credit 
the company s dealers may experience a further decline in retail sales resulting from general economic conditions  tightening of credit  political events or other factors 
the motorcycle industry has been affected by general economic conditions over which motorcycle manufacturers have little control 
these factors have caused a weaker retail environment leading to weaker demand for discretionary purchases and the decision to purchase a motorcycle has been and may continue to be affected by these factors 
the related tightening of credit has led to more limited availability of funds from financial institutions and other lenders and sources of capital which could adversely affect the ability of retail consumers to obtain loans for the purchase of motorcycles from lenders  including hdfs 
should general economic conditions or motorcycle industry demand continue to decline  our results of operations and financial condition may be further substantially adversely affected 
the motorcycle industry can also be affected by political conditions and other factors over which motorcycle manufacturers have little control 
the company and its independent dealers must balance the economies of level production with a more seasonal retail sales pattern 
the company generally records the sale of a motorcycle when it is shipped to the company s independent dealers and distributors 
in the past few years  increased availability of harley davidson motorcycles has resulted in the timing of retail purchases tracking more closely with regional motorcycle riding seasons 
the seasonality of the company s wholesale shipments affects its ability to continue to maintain relatively level production  inventories and shipments throughout the year 
as a result  the company and its independent dealers and distributors must balance the economies of level production with the inventory and other costs associated with a more seasonal retail sales pattern 
failure to balance the two  or any failure of the company to adequately adjust its methods of distributing motorcycles among its independent dealers and distributors  may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company relies on third party suppliers to obtain raw materials and provide component parts for use in the manufacture of its motorcycles 
the company cannot be certain that it will not experience supply problems such as unfavorable pricing or untimely delivery of raw materials and components 
in certain circumstances  the company relies on a single supplier to provide the entire requirement of a specific part  and a change in this established supply relationship may cause disruption in the company s production schedule 
in addition  the price and availability of raw materials and component parts from suppliers can be adversely affected by factors outside of the company s control such as the supply of a necessary raw material 
further  company suppliers may experience difficulty due to financial market disruption in funding their day to day cash flow needs because of tightening credit  and those suppliers who also serve the automotive industry may be experiencing financial difficulties due to a downturn in that industry  which could adversely affect their ability to supply the company 
these supplier risks may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
recent and any future government actions to stabilize credit markets and financial institutions or other industries may not be effective 
the us government recently enacted legislation and created several programs to help stabilize credit markets and financial institutions and restore liquidity  including the emergency economic stabilization act of  the federal reserve s commercial paper funding facility cpff and money market investor funding facility and 
table of contents the federal deposit insurance corporation s fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program 
additionally  the governments of many countries have announced similar measures for institutions in their respective countries 
further measures may be forthcoming in light of the new administration in the us there is no assurance that these programs individually or collectively will have beneficial effects in the credit markets or on general economic conditions  will address credit or liquidity issues of companies that participate in the programs or will reduce volatility or uncertainty in the financial markets 
the failure of these programs to have their intended effects could have a material adverse effect on the financial markets and economies in general  which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there is also no assurance that the company will be eligible or qualify to participate in any of these programs or that the programs will directly benefit the company in any other way 
to the extent that the company participates in these programs or other programs  there is no assurance that the company will continue to be eligible or qualify to participate or that such programs will remain available for sufficient periods of time or on acceptable terms to benefit the company  and the expiration of such programs could have unintended adverse effects on the company 
further  as a condition to participating in any such program  the company may need to accept terms and limitations that could adversely affect the company in other ways 
the company s financial services operations rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of its operations and may require additional funding to repay amounts that may become due in and beyond 
liquidity is essential to the company s financial services business 
the disruptions in the financial markets have caused many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to loan money to borrowers including financial institutions 
the disruption has affected and could continue to affect the company s choice of financing sources and its ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all 
for example  recent volatile conditions in the unsecured commercial paper and asset backed securitization markets have made capital raising in those markets challenging 
in addition  during  the company s financial services operations funded a greater percentage of their business through debt rather than the asset backed securitization market as compared to the company has identified three preferred options to support the funding requirements of its financial services operations and is pursuing those options 
the company will also seek to extend the credit facilities under which amounts would otherwise become due in however  there is no assurance that the efforts to pursue those options or other alternatives or to extend the facilities will be successful 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  the company might seek to meet some liquidity needs by drawing under its existing credit facilities 
however  under such extreme market conditions  there can be no assurance that funds will be available under such agreements or that available funds will be sufficient 
the company s financial services operations may be negatively affected by the increased difficulty in raising funding in the long term and short term debt capital markets or the equity capital markets 
these negative consequences may in turn adversely affect the company s business and results of operations in various ways  including through higher costs of capital  reduced funds available through its financial services operations to provide loans to independent dealers and their retail customers  and dilution to existing shareholders through the use of alternative sources of capital 
the company s financial services operations are highly dependent on accessing capital markets to fund their operations at competitive interest rates  the company s access to capital and its cost of capital are highly dependent upon its credit ratings  and any negative credit rating actions will adversely affect its earnings and results of operations 
the ability of the company and its financial services operations to access unsecured capital markets is influenced by their short term and long term credit ratings 
if the company s credit ratings are downgraded or its ratings 
table of contents outlook is negatively changed  the company s cost of borrowing will increase  resulting in reduced earnings and interest margins  or the company s access to capital may be disrupted or impaired 
in the event of a downgrade in the company s short term rating  the company s financial services operations would no longer be eligible to participate in the federal reserve s commercial paper funding facility 
the company s financial services operations are exposed to credit risk on its retail and wholesale receivables 
credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a failure by a customer to meet the terms of any contract with the company s financial services operations 
credit losses are influenced by general business and economic conditions  as well as contract terms  customer credit profiles and the new and used motorcycle market 
further negative changes in general business  economic or market factors may have an additional adverse impact on the company s financial services operations credit losses and future earnings 
in addition  credit exposure is significantly sensitive to any decline in new and used motorcycle prices 
the recent market turmoil has resulted in the tightening of credit  a lack of consumer confidence  unemployment and increased market volatility  all of which has led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies 
the company had higher retail receivables outstanding during as compared to  due to a reduction in asset backed securitization activity in  and therefore retained increased credit risk from retail receivables 
the company has a number of competitors of varying sizes that are based both inside and outside the united states some of which have greater financial resources than the company 
many of the company s competitors are more diversified than the company  and they may compete in the automotive market or all segments of the motorcycle market 
also  the company s manufacturer s suggested retail price for its motorcycles is generally higher than its competitors  and if price becomes a more important competitive factor for consumers in the heavyweight motorcycle market  the company may be at a competitive disadvantage 
in addition  the company s financial services operations face competition from various banks  insurance companies and other financial institutions that may have access to additional sources of capital at more competitive rates and terms 
failure to adequately address and respond to these competitive pressures worldwide may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s marketing strategy of associating its motorcycle products with a motorcycling lifestyle may not be successful with future customers 
the company has been successful in marketing its products in large part by promoting the experience of motorcycling 
this lifestyle is now more typically associated with a retail customer base comprised of individuals who are  on average  in their mid forties 
to sustain long term growth  the company must continue to be successful in promoting motorcycling to customers new to the sport of motorcycling including women  younger riders and more ethnically diverse riders 
the company s success depends upon the continued strength of the harley davidson brand 
the company believes that the harley davidson brand has significantly contributed to the success of its business and that maintaining and enhancing the brand is critical to expanding its customer base 
failure to protect the brand from infringers or to grow the value of the harley davidson brand may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s ability to remain competitive is dependent upon its capability to develop and successfully introduce new  innovative and compliant products 
the motorcycle market continues to advance in terms of cutting edge styling and new technology and  at the same time  be subject to increasing regulations related to safety and emissions 
the company must continue to distinguish its products from its competitors products with unique styling and new technologies and to protect its intellectual property from imitators 
in addition  these new products must comply with applicable regulations worldwide 
the company must make product advancements while maintaining the classic look  sound and feel associated with harley davidson products 
the company must also be able to design and manufacture these products and deliver them to the marketplace in an efficient and timely manner 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in these endeavors or that existing and prospective customers will like or want the company s new products 

table of contents the company s motorcycles segment is dependent upon unionized labor 
substantially all of the hourly employees working in the motorcycles segment are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements 
harley davidson motor company is currently a party to five collective bargaining agreements with local affiliates of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers and the united steelworkers of america that expire during february  july and march  these collective bargaining agreements generally cover wages  healthcare benefits and retirement plans  seniority  job classes and work rules 
there is no certainty that the company will be successful in negotiating new agreements with these unions that extend beyond the current expiration dates or that these new agreements will be on terms as favorable to the company as past labor agreements 
failure to renew these agreements when they expire or to establish new collective bargaining agreements on terms acceptable to the company and the unions could result in work stoppages or other labor disruptions which may have a material adverse effect on customer relationships and the company s business and results of operations 
the company s operations are dependent upon attracting and retaining skilled employees  including executive officers 
the company s future success depends on its continuing ability to identify  hire  develop  motivate and retain skilled personnel for all areas of its organization 
the company s current and future total compensation arrangements  which include benefits and cash bonuses  may not be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating the company s existing employees 
if the company does not succeed in attracting personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel  including executive officers  the company may be unable to develop and distribute products and services and effectively execute its plans and strategies 
the company incurs substantial costs with respect to employee pension and healthcare benefits 
the company s cash funding requirements and its estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and post retirement healthcare benefits are based on several factors that are outside the company s control 
these factors include funding requirements of the pension protection act of  the rate used to discount the future estimated liability  the rate of return on plan assets medical costs  retirement age and mortality 
changes in these factors can impact the expense and cash requirements associated with these benefits which could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations  liquidity or shareholders equity 
in addition  costs associated with these defined benefit retirement plans put the company under significant cost pressure as compared to our competitors 
due to significant declines in worldwide financial market conditions during  the funded status of the company s pension and postretirement healthcare plans was adversely affected 
the company is expecting it will have to make additional contributions of approximately million to million to further fund its pension and postretirement healthcare plans during beyond the amount of current benefit payments for supplemental employee retirement plans and agreements and postretirement healthcare plans 
also during  the company expects to continue its practice of funding the supplemental plans and agreements and postretirement healthcare plans in amounts equal to benefits paid during the year 
for future years  the company currently anticipates that additional contributions  beyond the amount of expected benefit payments  will be needed to pre fund the pension and postretirement healthcare plans 
the company manufactures products that create exposure to product liability claims and litigation 
to the extent plaintiffs are successful in showing that personal injury or property damage result from defects in the design or manufacture of the company s products  the company may be subject to claims for damages that are not covered by insurance 
the costs associated with defending product liability claims  including frivolous lawsuits  and payment of damages could be substantial 
the company s reputation may also be adversely affected by such claims  whether or not successful 

table of contents the company must maintain its reputation of being a good corporate citizen and treating customers  employees  suppliers and other stakeholders fairly

zarcone  who are current or former company officers or employees  as defendants 
in general  the erisa complaint includes factual allegations similar to those in the shareholder class action lawsuits and alleges on behalf of participants in certain harley davidson retirement savings plans that the plan fiduciaries breached their erisa fiduciary duties 
on december   the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the erisa complaint in its entirety 
briefing of the motion to dismiss was completed in april the company believes the allegations against all of the defendants in the lawsuits against the company are without merit and it intends to vigorously defend against them 
since all of these matters are in the preliminary stages  the company is unable to predict the scope or outcome or quantify their eventual impact  if any  on the company 
at this time  the company is also unable to estimate associated expenses or possible losses 
the company maintains insurance that may limit its financial exposure for defense costs and liability for an unfavorable outcome  should it not prevail  for claims covered by the insurance coverage 
environmental matters the company is involved with government agencies and groups of potentially responsible parties in various environmental matters  including a matter involving the cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination at its york  pennsylvania facility 
the york facility was formerly used by the us navy and amf prior to the purchase of the york facility by the company from amf in although the company is not certain as to the full extent of the environmental contamination at the york facility  it has been working with the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep since in undertaking environmental investigation and remediation activities  including an ongoing site wide remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs 
in january  the company entered into a settlement agreement the agreement with the navy 
the agreement calls for the navy and the company to contribute amounts into a trust equal to and  respectively  of future costs associated with environmental investigation and remediation activities at the york facility response costs 
the trust administers the payment of the response costs incurred at the york facility as covered by the agreement 
in february  the company was advised by the us environmental protection agency epa that it considers some of the company s remediation activities at the york facility to be subject to the epa s corrective action program under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and offered the company the option of addressing corrective action under a rcra facility lead agreement 
in july  the york facility was designated as the first site in pennsylvania to be addressed under the one cleanup program 
the program provides a more streamlined and efficient oversight of voluntary remediation by both padep and epa and will be carried out consistent with the agreement with the navy 
as a result  the rcra facility lead agreement has been superseded 
although the ri fs is still underway and substantial uncertainty exists concerning the nature and scope of the additional environmental investigation and remediation that will ultimately be required at the york facility  the company estimates that its share of the future response costs at the york facility will be approximately million 
the company has established reserves for this amount  which are included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the estimate of the company s future response costs that will be incurred at the york facility is based on reports of independent environmental consultants retained by the company  the actual costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete the necessary investigation and remediation activities 
response costs related to the remediation of soil are expected to be incurred over a period of several years ending in response costs related to ground water remediation may continue for some time beyond

interest expense was higher due to increased borrowings to support growth in outstanding retail receivables  partially offset by lower borrowing rates 
the increase in retail receivables outstanding was driven by a reduction in term asset backed securitization activity during due to capital market volatility 
the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to a million increase in the provision for credit losses 
other income decreased during as compared to primarily due to a million charge to earnings from the lower of cost or market value of its finance receivables held for sale 
hdfs uses discounted cash flow methodologies to estimate the fair value of finance receivables held for sale that incorporate appropriate assumptions for discount rate  funding costs and credit enhancement  as well as estimates concerning credit losses and prepayments that  in management s judgment  reflect assumptions marketplace participants would use 
any amount by which cost exceeds fair value is accounted for as a valuation adjustment with an offset to other income 
the decline in fair value below cost was due to higher projected credit losses  increased funding costs and an increased discount rate in the fourth quarter of from to 
income from securitizations during was lower as compared to due to a million write down of certain retained interests during  a loss on the first quarter securitization transaction and the absence of a securitization transaction in the last three quarters of this compares to a million write down and three securitization transactions completed in during  hdfs sold million in retail motorcycle loans in a securitization transaction and recognized a loss of million  or as a percentage of loans sold 
this compares to a gain as a percentage of loans sold of  or million  on billion of loans securitized in the loss in was driven by increased securitization funding costs due to capital market volatility and higher projected credit losses 
in the securitization transaction  hdfs retained million of the subordinated securities issued by the securitization trust 
the subordinated securities that were retained have been included in the investment in retained securitization interests a component of finance receivables held for investment in the consolidated balance sheets 
the cash proceeds from the securitization transaction are net of the cost of the retained subordinated securities 
income from securitizations was also negatively impacted in by a million write down of certain retained securitization interests 
the write downs  which occurred in june and december of and are considered permanent impairments  resulted from a decline in the fair value of certain retained securitization interests due to higher actual and anticipated credit losses on those securitization portfolios and an increase in the discount rate from to in the fourth quarter of this compares to an impairment charge of million incurred in 
table of contents hdfs reviews its assumptions for determining the fair value of the investment in retained securitization interests each quarter 
key assumptions include expected losses  prepayment speed and discount rate 
hdfs determines these assumptions by reviewing historical trends and current economic conditions 
given the challenging us economy  credit losses on hdfs retail installment loans have increased  and as a result  the fair value of retained securitization interests has declined and in some cases this decline is permanent 
depending on the behavior of future loss rates  prepayment speeds and the discount rate  hdfs could experience further write downs of its retained interests  which had a fair value of million as of december  a write down in the retained securitization interest generally represents a non cash charge in the period in which it is recorded  but ultimately represents a reduction in the residual cash flow that hdfs expects to receive from its investment in retained securitization interests 
annualized losses on hdfs managed retail motorcycle loans were in compared to for the day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at december  increased to from at december  managed retail loans include loans held by hdfs as well as those sold through securitization transactions 
the increase in losses was primarily due to a higher incidence of loss resulting from an increase in delinquent accounts

sfas r is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact the new disclosure requirements will have on its consolidated financial statements and notes 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the company s financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
finance receivable securitizations the company has sold retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions utilizing qualifying special purpose entities qspes as defined by sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
upon sale of retail loans in a securitization transaction  hdfs receives cash and retains an interest in excess cash flows  subordinated securities  and cash reserve account deposits  all of which are collectively referred to as retained interests in the securitized receivables 
retained interests are carried at fair value and are periodically reviewed for impairment 
market value quotes of fair value are generally not available for retained interests 
therefore  fair value is measured using discounted cash flow methodologies that incorporate management s best estimate of key assumptions that  in management s judgment  reflect the assumptions marketplace participants would use 
the impact of changes to key assumptions is shown in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
hdfs retains servicing rights under retail loans that it has sold to the securitization trust and receives a servicing fee 
the servicing fee paid to hdfs is considered adequate compensation for the services provided and is included in financial services income as earned 
gains or losses on current year securitizations from the sale of retail loans are recorded as a component of financial services income and are based in part on certain assumptions including expected credit losses  prepayment speed  and discount rates 
gains or losses on sales of retail loans also depend on the original carrying amount of the retail loans  which is allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
valuation of loans held for sale finance receivables held for sale in the aggregate are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value 
hdfs uses discounted cash flow methodologies to estimate the fair value of finance receivables held for sale that incorporate appropriate assumptions for discount rate  funding costs and credit enhancement  as well as estimates concerning credit losses and prepayments that  in management s judgment  reflect assumptions marketplace participants would use 
any amount by which cost exceeds fair value is accounted for as a valuation adjustment with an offset to other income 
allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables held for investment the allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover the losses of principal in the existing finance receivables held for investment portfolio 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is generally based on hdfs past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  current economic conditions  specific borrower s ability to repay and the estimated value of any underlying collateral 
product warranty estimated warranty costs are reserved for each motorcycle at the time of sale 
the warranty reserve is an estimated cost per unit sold based upon historical company claim data used in combination with other known factors that may affect future warranty claims 
the company updates its warranty estimates quarterly to ensure that the warranty reserves are based on the most current information available 
the company believes that past claim experience is indicative of future claims  however  the factors affecting actual claims can be volatile 
as a result  actual claims experience may differ from estimated which could lead to material changes in the company s warranty provision and related reserves 
the company s warranty liability is discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
pensions and other postretirement benefits the company has several defined benefit pension plans and several postretirement healthcare benefit plans  which cover substantially all employees of the motorcycles segment 
the company also has unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan agreements serpa with certain employees which were instituted to replace benefits lost under the tax revenue reconciliation act of retirement plan pension  serpa and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs are calculated through actuarial valuations 
the valuation of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs relies on key assumptions including discount rates  long term expected return on plan assets  future compensation and healthcare cost trend rates 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company adopted the measurement date provisions of sfas no 
as of january  accordingly  the company s actuarial measurement date the date when the company evaluates and updates all of its assumptions changed from september to december 
table of contents the company determines its discount rate assumptions by referencing high quality long term bond rates that are matched to the duration of its own benefit obligations 
based on this analysis  the discount rate for retirement plan obligations was decreased from as of september  to as of december  the company determines its healthcare trend assumption for the postretirement healthcare obligation by considering factors such as estimated healthcare inflation  the utilization of healthcare benefits and changes in the health of plan participants 
based on the company s assessment of this data as of december   the company lowered its healthcare cost trend rate to from as of september  the company expects the healthcare cost trend rate to reach its ultimate rate of beginning in these assumption changes were reflected immediately in the benefit obligation and will be amortized into net periodic benefit costs over future periods 
the following information is provided to illustrate the sensitivity of pension and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs to changes in these major assumptions in thousands amounts based on current assumptions impact of a decrease in the discount rate impact of a increase in the healthcare cost trend rate net periodic benefit costs pension and serpa   n a postretirement healthcare benefit obligations pension and serpa   n a postretirement healthcare this information should not be viewed as predictive of future amounts 
the calculation of retirement plan obligations and costs is based on many factors in addition to those discussed here 
this information should be considered in combination with the information provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
stock compensation costs the total cost of the company s share based awards is equal to the grant date fair value per award multiplied by the number of awards granted adjusted for forfeitures 
this cost is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the service periods of the awards 
forfeitures are initially estimated based on historical company information and subsequently updated over the life of the awards to ultimately reflect actual forfeitures 
as a result  changes in forfeiture activity can influence the amount of stock compensation cost recognized from period to period 
the company generally determines the number of share based awards granted by first determining the total cost of the award  which is a function of employee salary  level and performance 
on the date of grant  the number of awards granted is then computed by dividing the total cost of the award by the grant date fair value of the award unit 
the company estimates the fair value of option awards as of the grant date using a lattice based option valuation model which utilizes ranges of assumptions over the expected term of the options  including stock price volatility  dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
the valuation model uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior and employee terminations 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 

table of contents the company uses implied volatility to determine the expected volatility of its stock 
implied volatility take into account both historical and future expectations of volatility 
the implied volatility is derived from options that are actively traded and the market prices of both the traded options and underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date reasonably close to the grant date of the employee share options 
in addition  the traded options have exercise prices that are both a near the money and b close to the exercise price of the employee share options 
finally  the remaining maturities of the traded options on which the estimate is based are at least one year 
dividend yield was based on the company s expected dividend payments and the risk free rate was based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
changes in the valuation assumptions could result in a significant change to the cost of an individual option 
however  the total cost of an award is also a function of the number of awards granted  and as result  the company has the ability to control the cost of its equity awards by adjusting the number of awards granted 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of the company s business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
an unrecognized tax benefit represents the difference between the recognition of benefits related to exposure items for income tax reporting purposes and financial reporting purposes 
the unrecognized tax benefit is included within other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company has a reserve for interest and penalties on exposure items  if applicable  which is recorded as a component of the overall income tax provision 
the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain  management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provision includes amounts sufficient to pay any assessments 
nonetheless  the amounts ultimately paid  if any  upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 
contractual obligations a summary of the company s expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of december  is as follows in thousands thereafter total principal payments on debt interest payments on debt operating lease payments as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  as of december   the company classified million related to its unsecured commercial paper and its global credit facilities as defined in liquidity and capital resources as long term debt as of december  this amount is classified as long term because it is supported by the global credit facilities and is expected to remain outstanding for an uninterrupted period extending beyond one year  accordingly  the company has assumed that this amount will be repaid in interest obligations include the impact of interest rate hedges outstanding as of december  interest for floating rate instruments  as calculated above  assumes december  rates remain constant 

table of contents as of december   the company had no material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property  plant and equipment which generally have terms of less than days 
the company has long term obligations related to its pension and postretirement plans at december  due to the current funded status of the pension and postretirement plans  the company is anticipating future contributions  beyond the amounts of current benefit payments  will be necessary for the company s expected future contributions to these plans are provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has unrecognized tax benefits of million and accrued interest and penalties of million as of december  however  the company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate for the period of cash settlement for either the million of liability of unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties of million 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of its term asset backed securitization program  hdfs transfers retail motorcycle loans to a special purpose bankruptcy remote wholly owned subsidiary 
the subsidiary sells the retail loans to a securitization trust in exchange for the proceeds from term asset backed securities issued by the securitization trust 
the term asset backed securities  usually notes with various maturities and interest rates  are secured by future collections of the purchased retail installment loans 
activities of the securitization trust are limited to acquiring retail loans  issuing term asset backed securities and making payments on securities to investors 
due to the nature of the assets held by the securitization trust and the limited nature of its activities  the securitization trusts are considered qualifying special purpose entities qspes as defined by sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 assets and liabilities of the qspes are not consolidated in the financial statements of the company 
hdfs does not guarantee payments on the securities issued by the securitization trusts or the projected cash flows from the related loans purchased from hdfs 
the company s retained securitization interests  excluding servicing rights  are subordinate to the interests of securitization trust investors 
such investors have priority interests in the cash collections on the retail loans sold to the securitization trust after payment of servicing fees and in the cash reserve account deposits 
these priority interests ultimately could impact the value of the company s investment in retained securitization interests 
investors also do not have recourse to assets of hdfs for failure of the obligors on the retail loans to pay when due 
total investment in retained securitization interests at december  was million 
the securitization trusts have a limited life and generally terminate upon final distribution of amounts owed to the investors in the term asset backed securities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of hdfs term asset backed securitization program 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company utilized an asset backed commercial paper conduit facility that did not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment under sfas no 
commitments and contingencies the company is subject to lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  product and other matters 
in determining required reserves related to these items  the company carefully analyzes cases and considers the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes  as well as the potential range of possible loss 
the required reserves are monitored on an ongoing basis and are updated based on new developments or new information in each matter

on december   the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the erisa complaint in its entirety 
briefing of the motion to dismiss was completed in april the company believes the allegations against all of the defendants in the lawsuits against the company are without merit and it intends to vigorously defend against them 
since all of these matters are in the preliminary stages  the company is unable to predict the scope or outcome or quantify their eventual impact  if any  on the company 
at this time  the company is also unable to estimate associated expenses or possible losses 
the company maintains insurance that may limit its financial exposure for defense costs and liability for an unfavorable outcome  should it not prevail  for claims covered by the insurance coverage 
environmental matters the company is involved with government agencies and groups of potentially responsible parties in various environmental matters  including a matter involving the cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination at its york  pennsylvania facility 
the york facility was formerly used by the us navy and amf prior to the purchase of the york facility by the company from amf in although the company is not certain as to the full extent of the environmental contamination at the york facility  it has been working with the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep since in undertaking environmental investigation and remediation activities  including an ongoing site wide remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs 
in january  the company entered into a settlement agreement the agreement with the navy 
the agreement calls for the navy and the company to contribute amounts into a trust equal to and  respectively  of future costs associated with environmental investigation and remediation activities at the york facility response costs 
the trust administers the payment of the response costs incurred at the york facility as covered by the agreement 

table of contents in february  the company was advised by the us environmental protection agency epa that it considers some of the company s remediation activities at the york facility to be subject to the epa s corrective action program under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and offered the company the option of addressing corrective action under a rcra facility lead agreement 
in july  the york facility was designated as the first site in pennsylvania to be addressed under the one cleanup program 
the program provides a more streamlined and efficient oversight of voluntary remediation by both padep and epa and will be carried out consistent with the agreement with the navy 
as a result  the rcra facility lead agreement has been superseded 
although the ri fs is still underway and substantial uncertainty exists concerning the nature and scope of the additional environmental investigation and remediation that will ultimately be required at the york facility  the company estimates that its share of the future response costs at the york facility will be approximately million 
the company has established reserves for this amount  which are included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the estimate of the company s future response costs that will be incurred at the york facility is based on reports of independent environmental consultants retained by the company  the actual costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete the necessary investigation and remediation activities 
response costs related to the remediation of soil are expected to be incurred over a period of several years ending in response costs related to ground water remediation may continue for some time beyond under the terms of the sale of the commercial vehicles division in  the company agreed to indemnify utilimaster corporation  until december  for certain claims related to environmental contamination present at the date of sale  up to million

liquidity and capital resources as of december  over the long term  the company expects that its business model will continue to generate cash that will allow it to invest in the business  fund future growth opportunities and return value to shareholders 
at the same time  the company recognizes that the recent disruption in the global capital markets has impacted its ability to access funding sources historically utilized to support the operation of its financial services business 
during  the company funded its financial services operations with unsecured debt  unsecured commercial paper  an asset backed commercial paper conduit facility  a committed unsecured bank credit facility and a term asset backed securitization 
the company has estimated that hdfs funding requirements in will be approximately billion in addition to amounts that may become due in july if the company is unable to extend its day credit facility that is part of its global credit facilities as defined below or on march  under the million asset backed commercial paper conduit facility that was entered into in december the company intends to satisfy hdfs funding requirements through a combination of preferred actions 
the first is for hdfs or the company to attempt to access the unsecured debt capital markets  the company s issuance of million of senior unsecured five year notes completed in february is an example of this 
the company also intends to seek to renew its day credit facility that expires in july and to increase and extend the existing million asset backed commercial paper conduit facility 
expanding and extending the asset backed commercial paper conduit facility would supplement the existing unsecured commercial paper program 
finally  the company is working to gain access to the asset backed securitization market through the us federal reserve s talf program 
the company is in the process of researching the program and determining how it may benefit from it 
retail motorcycle loans have been included as eligible assets in the program  however exact details of the talf program are not yet finalized 
no assurance can be given that the company s efforts to pursue these options will 
table of contents be successful  and if such efforts are not successful  the company will need to consider other alternatives

at december   the notional us dollar value of outstanding euro and australian dollar foreign currency contracts was million 
the company estimates that a uniform weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies underlying these contracts would result in a decrease in the fair value of the contracts of approximately million as of december  further disclosure relating to the fair value of derivative financial instruments is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the company financed its acquisition of mv agusta and its initial working capital requirements through million of euro denominated debt
