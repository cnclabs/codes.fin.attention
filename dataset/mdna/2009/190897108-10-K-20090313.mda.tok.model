item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation executive summary the company is a financial holding company that offers a broad array of financial service products to its target market of professionals  small and medium sized businesses  and high net worth individuals 
our operating segments include commercial banking  investment banking  investment advisory and trust and insurance 
earnings are derived primarily from our net interest income  which is interest income less interest expense  and our noninterest income earned from fee based business lines and banking service fees  offset by noninterest expense 
as the majority of our assets are interest earning and our liabilities are interest bearing  changes in interest rates impact our net interest margin  the largest component of our operating revenue which is defined as net interest income plus noninterest income 
we manage our 
table of contents interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on our operating results 
we also have focused on reducing our dependency on our net interest margin by increasing our noninterest income 
our company has focused on developing an organization with personnel  management systems and products that will allow us to compete effectively and position us for growth 
the cost of this process relative to our size has been high 
in addition  we have operated with excess capacity during the start up phases of various projects due to our commitment to technology and expansion of our fee based businesses 
as a result  relatively high levels of noninterest expense have adversely affected our earnings over the past several years 
salaries and employee benefits comprised most of this overhead category 
however  we believe that our compensation levels have allowed us to recruit and retain a highly qualified management team capable of implementing our business strategies 
we believe our compensation policies  which include the granting of stock based compensation to many employees and the offering of an employee stock purchase plan  have highly motivated our employees and enhanced our ability to maintain customer loyalty and generate earnings 
for additional discussion on stock based compensation  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
industry overview 
the us commercial banking industry has been significantly impacted in by decreased values in real estate related assets  a downturn in the financial markets and a significant tightening in the credit market 
the weakened us housing market has caused the industry to realize significant losses on write downs of investment securities securitized by real estate and higher credit costs for write downs of loans issued for investment 
during  banks failed and went into receivership with the fdic compared to bank failures in the previous five years 
through february  banks have already gone into receivership 
in september  the federal housing finance authority placed fannie mae and freddie mac  who collectively guarantee more than half of the outstanding mortgages in the us  into conservatorship 
the fdic reported that nearly one out of three fdic insured institutions reported a net loss in the fourth quarter of and that the industry as a whole reported its first net loss since the senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices conducted by the frb found that of domestic banks responding to the survey had tightened their lending standards on medium to large commercial and industrial c i loans during the fourth quarter of compared to in the fourth quarter of the survey also found that of domestic respondents had increased the spread on loan rates over their cost of funds for medium to large loans in the fourth quarter of compared to in the same period of during this period  loan loss provisions at fdic insured institutions reached a year high and absorbed one third of the industry s operating revenue  while quarterly earnings for the industry fell below billion for the first time since the overall market conditions led the federal open markets committee fomc to reduce the target federal funds rate by basis points in the last four months of  the first decrease since the fomc continued this strategy throughout  when the target federal funds rate was decreased an additional basis points until the target reached its floor of to basis points in december 
while the company does not originate or purchase subprime loans  nearly all financial service organizations have been impacted by the current environment 
company overview 
from december   the first complete fiscal year under the current management team  to december   our organization has grown from a bank holding company with two bank locations and total assets of million to a diversified financial services holding company with bank locations  six fee based businesses and total assets of billion 
certain key metrics of our operating segments at december  and are as follows 
table of contents investment corporate commercial investment advisory support and banking banking trust insurance other consolidated in thousands  except per share data net income loss diluted earnings loss per common share total assets net income loss diluted earnings loss per common share total assets noted below are some of the significant financial performance measures and operational results for our commercial banking franchise recognized provision for loan losses of million in  compared to million in net charge offs for totaled million  compared to million for nonperforming assets also increased to million at the end of  from million at the end of the increase in provision for loan loss expense was the primary driver in the decrease in net income for both the commercial banking segment and the company 
a migration of loans to a more adversely graded credit category in  including charge off  caused the increase in the provision for loan losses 
investment banking lost per diluted share in  down from a contribution in investment banking revenues are transactional in nature and  as a result  the segment s earnings can be more volatile 
while not a significant source of the company s earnings  the segment has been a positive contributor over the last several years 
investment advisory and trust lost per diluted share in  down from a neutral contribution in on december   the company acquired wagner  an investment advisor providing investment management services for high net worth individuals and families  foundations and non profit organizations 
top line revenue for the segment was positively impacted by the acquisition of wagner in offsetting the increase in revenue from the wagner acquisition was a decrease in revenue due to market attrition of assets under management 
with all major market indices falling in  this negatively impacted the segment since revenue is generated based on a percentage of assets under management 
insurance contributed per diluted share in  an increase from a loss per diluted share in on january   the company completed the acquisition of bda  a provider of commercial and personal p c insurance brokerage and risk management consulting services to individuals and businesses in the az market 
the acquisition of bda at the beginning of positively impacted both top line revenue and net income for the segment 
the wealth transfer business is transactional by nature and fluctuates based on the number of life insurance policies closed during a year 
during  the segment nearly doubled the revenue on wealth transfer cases from the amount recognized in the wealth transfer business was negatively impacted in  when a higher than normal number of cases were rejected in underwriting due to unforeseen medical issues 
to a lesser extent  the segment was also impacted by the overall reduction in insurance premiums being realized throughout the commercial insurance industry 
corporate support and other had a decrease in its net loss and loss per share  primarily due to a decrease in interest rates that reduced our interest expense on our variable rate junior subordinated debentures 
this was partially offset by additional interest expense on the new issuance of subordinated notes payable  discussed below 

table of contents the company recognized losses of million in on valuation adjustments of other real estate owned and other than temporary impairments on investments 
in the third and fourth quarter  the company successfully raised million through a privately placed issuance of subordinated notes payable 
the subordinated notes payable qualify as tier capital and helped strengthen the company s capital position 
further strengthening the company s capital position  on december   the company became the first colorado based financial institution to receive a capital investment from the treasury under the cpp 
the company received million from the issuance of series b preferred stock that pays a cumulative dividend of for the first five years and thereafter 
the company s total risk based capital ratio increased to at the end of from at the end of this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form k beginning on page f for a discussion of the segments included in our principal activities and for certain financial information for each segment  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
bank 
the commercial bank segment  the cornerstone of our franchise  had continued success in growing the loan portfolio and noninterest bearing demand deposits 
loans grew by and noninterest bearing demand deposits grew by 
however  earnings were down as the bank was not immune to the slowdown in the overall economy and reinforced the allowance for loan losses with a significant increase in the provision for loan losses 
fee based business lines 
the company s fee based business lines investment banking  insurance  and investment advisory and trust operated at a slight loss for on a combined basis 
however  before parent company management fees  central service allocations and amortization  the fee based companies generated positive cash flow 
our ratio of noninterest income to total operating revenues was for compared to in we believe that through the combination of our commercial banking franchise and our fee based businesses  we are uniquely situated to service our commercial clients throughout their business lifecycle 
we are able to help our customers grow by providing banking services from our bank franchise  capital planning from gmb  and employee and executive benefits packages from fdl 
we can assist in planning for the future with wealth transfer and business succession planning from fdl 
we are able to protect assets with p c insurance from cobiz insurance 
we can facilitate exit and retirement strategies with merger and acquisition services from gmb  and investment management services with acmg and wagner 
we are also able to preserve our customers wealth with trust and fiduciary services from cobiz trust  investment management services from acmg and wagner  and wealth transfer services from fdl 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
in making those critical accounting estimates  we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate 
different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the assumptions that could occur  could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations 

table of contents allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires subjective estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectibilty of loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
we maintain a loan review program independent of the lending function that is designed to reduce and control risk in the lending function 
it includes the monitoring of lending activities with respect to underwriting and processing new loans  preventing insider abuse  and timely follow up and corrective action for loans showing signs of deterioration in quality 
we also have a systematic process to evaluate individual loans and pools of loans within our loan portfolio 
we maintain a loan grading system whereby each loan is assigned a grade between and  with representing the highest quality credit  representing a non accrual loan where collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable  and representing a loss that has been or will be charged off 
grades are assigned based upon the degree of risk associated with repayment of a loan in the normal course of business pursuant to the original terms 
loans above a certain dollar amount that are adversely graded are reported to the loan committee and the chief credit officer along with current financial information  a collateral analysis and an action plan 
individual loans that are deemed to be impaired are evaluated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  we analyze the various components of the loan portfolio  including all significant credits  on an individual basis 
when analyzing the adequacy  we segment the loan portfolio into components with similar characteristics  such as risk classification  past due status  type of loan  industry or collateral 
possible factors that may impact the allowance for loan losses include  but are not limited to changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards as well as collection  charge off and recovery practices  changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments  including the condition of various market segments  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans  and trends in the volume of non accrual loans  troubled debt restructurings  and other loan modifications  the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations  and the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio 
refer to the provision and allowance for loan and credit losses section under results of operations below for further discussion on management s methodology 
recoverability of goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that we evaluate on an annual basis or whenever events occur which may indicate possible impairment whether any portion of our recorded goodwill is impaired 
the recoverability of goodwill is a critical accounting policy that requires subjective estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of 
table of contents the reporting unit is not considered impaired and it is not necessary to continue to step two of the impairment process 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  step two is performed  where the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill 
implied goodwill is computed as a residual value after allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using market multiples of comparable entities  including recent transactions  or a combination of market multiples and a discounted cash flow methodology 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires a high degree of subjective management assumption 
discounted cash flow valuation models utilize variables such as revenue growth rates  expense trends  discount rates and terminal values 
based upon an evaluation of key data and market factors  management selects from a range the specific variables to be incorporated into the valuation model 
we conducted our annual evaluation of our reporting units at december  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  at december  the estimated fair value of all reporting units exceeded their carrying values and goodwill impairment was not deemed to exist 
the fair value calculations were also tested for sensitivity to reflect reasonable variations  including adjusting the discount rate and keeping all other variables constant and reducing projected revenue growth and projected cost savings 
using this sensitivity approach  there was no impairment identified in any reporting unit 
however  during  the financial services industry  including the company  realized a significant decrease in market value 
a continuation of this trend may indicate that the individual reporting units of an entity may also be impaired 
if the company s market value continues to decrease and the company is unable to reconcile the combined fair value of its reporting units to its market value  the company may need to move to step two of the impairment process 
step two of the evaluation could result in the determination that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value and that goodwill relating to the reporting units has been impaired 
in january and february of  the company s market capitalization decreased approximately from its value at the end of due to the decrease  it is likely that the company will need to further evaluate its goodwill impairment in the first quarter of if we were to conclude that goodwill has been impaired  that conclusion could result in a non cash goodwill impairment charge  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
share based payments on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective method 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  cancelled or repurchased after that date and the portion of prior awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we applied the intrinsic value method for our stock based compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb accounting for stock issued to employees  which was allowed by sfas as an alternative to the fair value method recommended by sfas sfas r requires that the cash retained as a result of the tax deductibility of employee share based awards be presented as a component of cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
in prior periods  this amount was reported as a component of cash flows from operating activities 
under sfas r  we use the black scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the black scholes fair value model includes various assumptions  including the expected volatility  expected life and expected dividend rate of the options 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the amount of options issued that are expected to be forfeited 
these assumptions reflect our best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  stock based compensation expense  as calculated and recorded under 
table of contents sfas r  could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if we use different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods 
fair value the company has adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  as it applies to financial assets and liabilities effective january  sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
pursuant to sfas  the company measures investments  derivative instruments and impaired loans 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels and of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level of the hierarchy 
fair value may be used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities such as available for sale securities and derivatives in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting 
similarly  fair value may be used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets or liabilities such as impaired loans 
depending on the nature of the asset or liability  the company uses various valuation techniques and assumptions in accordance with sfas to determine the instrument s fair value 
at december   or million of total assets  consisting of million in available for sale securities and million in derivative instruments  represented assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
at december   or million of total liabilities represented derivative instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consisting of impaired loans represented or million of total assets 
certain private label mbs valued using broker dealer quotes based on proprietary broker models  which are considered by the company an unobservable input level  totaled million or of total assets at december  the company recognized no gains or losses in relation to the private label mbs for the year ended december  for additional information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider to be significant accounting policies  however  these policies  which are disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
recent accounting pronouncements on january   the company adopted emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for purchases of life insurance determining the amount that could be realized in accordance with fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for purchases of life insurance eitf

on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at specified election dates 
for financial instruments elected to be accounted for at fair value  an entity will report the unrealized gains and losses in earnings 
the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value is to be recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
the company has not elected the fair value option for any financial instruments since the adoption on january  and there was no impact on the consolidated financial statements relating to the adoption of sfas on january   the company adopted eitf  accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements eitf 
the ratified final consensus on this issue requires companies to recognize an obligation for the future post retirement benefits provided to employees in the form of death benefits to be paid to their beneficiaries through endorsement split dollar policies carried in bank owned life insurance boli  the effects of which are to be recognized through either a a change in accounting principle through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption  or b a change in accounting principle through retrospective application to all prior periods 
upon adoption  the company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of approximately  that was charged to retained earnings when it established the obligation for future post retirement benefits relating to the company s applicable endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
this statement amends arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary

we also originate residential mortgage loans on a limited basis as an accommodation to our preferred customers 
the primary risks of real estate mortgage loans include the borrower s inability to pay  material decreases in the value of the real estate that is being held as collateral and significant increases in interest rates  which may make the real estate mortgage loan unprofitable 
we do not actively seek residential mortgage loans for our own portfolio  but rather refer such loans to other financial institutions

a delinquent loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when it becomes days past due 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all accrued and unpaid interest on the loan is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when the issues relating to a nonaccrual loan are finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual write down or charge off of the principal balance of the loan  which may necessitate additional charges to earnings 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to the borrower  or the reduction of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur 
interest income that would have been recorded had nonaccrual loans performed in accordance with their original contract terms during was million 
interest income that would have been recorded had nonaccrual loans performed in accordance with their original contract terms and interest income recognized on nonaccrual loans during and was not material 
oreo represents real property taken by the bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower 
repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers 
repossessed assets and oreo are carried at the lesser of cost or fair market value  less selling costs 
nonperforming assets increased by million in total nonperforming assets increased by million in colorado and million in arizona 
included in nonperforming assets at december  was million in oreo 
oreo was comprised of seven properties of which six were located in arizona and one in colorado 
in addition to the nonperforming assets described above  at december   we had loan relationships considered by management to be potential problem loans  with outstanding principal totaling approximately million 
a potential problem loan is one as to which management has concerns about the borrower s future performance under the terms of the loan contract 
for our protection  management monitors these loans closely 
these loans are current as to the principal and interest and  accordingly  are not included in the nonperforming asset categories 
however  further deterioration may result in the loan being classified as nonperforming 
the level of potential problem loans is factored into the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents analysis of allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s recognition of the risks of extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio 
the allowance is maintained to provide for probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans and for losses inherent in the loan portfolio that have been incurred at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is based on various factors affecting the loan portfolio  including a review of problem loans  business conditions  historical loss experience  evaluation of the quality of the underlying collateral  and holding and disposal costs 
the allowance is increased by additional charges to operating income and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s recognition of a separate reserve for off balance sheet loan commitments and letters of credit 
while the allowance for loan losses is recorded as a contra asset to the loan portfolio on the consolidated balance sheets  the allowance for credit losses is recorded in accrued interest and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
although the allowances are presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets  any losses incurred from credit losses would be reported as a charge off in the allowance for loan losses  since any loss would be recorded after the off balance sheet commitment had been funded 
due to the relationship of these allowances  as extensions of credit underwritten through a comprehensive risk analysis  information on both the allowance for loan and credit losses positions is presented in the following table

loans charged off  net of amounts recovered from such loans  reduce the allowance for loan losses 
the amount of the allowance is a function of the levels of loans outstanding  the level of nonperforming loans  historical loan loss experience  the amount of loan losses actually charged against the reserve during a given period and current economic conditions 
federal regulatory agencies  as part of their examination process  review our loans and allowance for loan and credit losses 
we believe that our allowance for loan and credit losses is adequate to cover anticipated loan and credit losses 
however  management may determine a need to increase the allowances for loan and credit losses  or regulators  when reviewing the bank s loan and commitment portfolio in the future  may request the bank increase such allowances 
either of these events could adversely affect our earnings 
further  there can be no assurance that our actual loan and credit losses will not exceed the allowances for loan and credit losses 

table of contents the allowance for loan losses consists of three elements i specific reserves determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas  based on probable losses on specific loans  ii general reserves determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  based on historical loan loss experience adjusted for other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company  and iii unallocated reserves 
specific reserves 
the company continuously evaluates its reserve for loan losses to maintain an adequate level to absorb loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
reserves on loans identified as impaired are based on discounted expected cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate  the observable market value of the loan or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
the fair value of the collateral is determined in accordance with sfas loans are considered to be impaired in accordance with the provisions of sfas  when it is probable that all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms will not be collected 
factors contributing to the determination of specific reserves include the financial condition of the borrower  changes in the value of pledged collateral and general economic conditions 
general reserves 
general reserves are considered part of the allocated portion of the allowance 
we use a comprehensive loan grading process for our loan portfolios 
based on this process  we assign a loss factor to each pool of graded loans 
we use a combination of our long term average loss experience and external loss data in determining the appropriate loss factor 
this estimate represents the potential unconfirmed losses within the portfolio 
the historical estimation for each loan pool is then adjusted to account for factors  which may cause future losses to deviate from historical levels 
factors considered by management that are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with our current portfolio to differ from historical loss experience include changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments  changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due loans  and trends in the volume of non accrual loans  troubled debt restructurings  and other loan modifications  changes in the quality of the bank s loan review system and the degree of oversight by the bank s board of directors  the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations  the impact of competition on loan structuring and pricing  and the effect of external factors  such as legal and regulatory requirements  on the level of estimated credit losses in the bank s current portfolio 
the company has an internal loan review department that is independent of the lending function to challenge and corroborate the loan grading system  and provide additional analysis in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the allocated reserve for graded loans  a portion of the allowance is determined by segmenting the portfolio into product groupings with similar risk characteristics 
this supplemental portion of the allowance includes our judgmental consideration of any additional amounts necessary for subjective factors such as economic uncertainties and excess concentration risks 
concentration risk limits have been established for  among other things  certain industry concentrations  large balance and highly leveraged credit relationships that exceed specified risk grades  and loans originated with policy exceptions 
management evaluates the degree of risk that each one of these components has on the quality of the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis 
while management utilizes its best judgment and information available  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors 
table of contents beyond the company s control  including the performance of our loan portfolio  the economy  changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications 
unallocated reserves 
the unallocated reserve  which is judgmentally determined  is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss when evaluating reserves for individual loans or pools of loans 
the methodology used in the periodic review of reserve adequacy  which is performed at least quarterly  is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in actual and expected credit losses 
these changes are reflected in both the general and unallocated reserves 
the historical loss ratios and estimated risk factors related to segmenting our loan portfolio  which are key considerations in this analysis  are updated quarterly and are weighted more heavily for recent economic conditions 
the review of reserve adequacy is performed by executive management and presented to the audit committee quarterly for its review and consideration 
the table below provides an allocation of the year end allowance for loan and credit losses by loan and commitment type  however  allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories at december  in thousands amount of allowance loans in category as a of total gross loans amount of allowance loans in category as a of total gross loans amount of allowance loans in category as a of total gross loans amount of allowance loans in category as a of total gross loans amount of allowance loans in category as a of total gross loans commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer other unallocated off balance sheet commitments total we believe that any allocation of the allowance into categories creates an appearance of precision that does not exist 
the allocation table should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts  by loan classification  to be charged to the allowance 
we believe that the table is a useful device for assessing the adequacy of the allowance as a whole 
the allowance is utilized as a single unallocated allowance available for all loans 
in  the company adopted a more refined segmentation system that resulted in a majority of the prior unallocated reserve being reallocated into the allowance for commercial loans 
part of the refinement in our segmentation involved assigning increased reserve factors to higher risk lending activities  such as leverage financings  certain loans lacking personal guarantees  land acquisition and development loans  or speculative real estate loans 
overall during  economic conditions continued to deteriorate 
while the colorado economy outperformed the majority of other metropolitan areas nationally over the last year  it began to show increasing signs of weakness during the fourth quarter of these broader economic trends impacted the company s colorado loan portfolio  which saw an increase in adversely graded credits in the arizona market continued to work through the issues related to a severely depressed residential housing market during the provision for loan and credit losses increased by million and million to million and million for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
as a result  the company provided million and million more in provision for loan and credit losses than it charged off during and  respectively 
the company s allowance for loan and credit losses to total loans increased to and at december  and december   respectively 
the allowance for loan and credit losses to nonperforming loans decreased from at december   to at december  we believe that our allowance for loan and credit losses is adequate to cover anticipated loan and credit losses 
however  due to changes in the factors considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan and credit losses  management may determine a need to increase the 
table of contents allowance for loan and credit losses 
such determination could have an adverse effect in the level of future loan and credit loss provisions and the company s earnings 
investments our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of securities rated aaa or better by various nationally recognized rating agencies  with the majority of the portfolio either maturing or repricing within a one to five year period 
our practice is to purchase primarily us treasury and us government agency backed securities 
our investment strategies are reviewed in bi monthly meetings of the asset liability management committee 
our mortgage backed securities are typically classified as available for sale 
our goals with respect to our securities portfolio are to maximize safety and soundness  provide adequate liquidity  maximize rate of return within the constraints of applicable liquidity requirements  and complement asset liability management strategies

the purchases included mortgage backed securities  trust preferred securities and corporate bond securities 
the increase from security purchases was offset by million in maturities and principal pay downs  there were no sales of available for sale securities in in  the company identified and subsequently sold approximately million in securities that were not in line with the current asset liability model 
during  the net unrealized loss on available for sale securities increased by million 
the increase in our unrealized loss resulted from market changes in interest rates and overall market illiquidity 
during  net unrealized loss on the available for sale securities decreased by million 
partially contributing to the decrease was million related to the realization of losses on securities sold and called during at december   the company s securities in a temporary unrealized loss position consisted primarily of mortgage backed and trust preferred securities 
the mortgage backed securities consist primarily of securities issued by government sponsored entities 
the fair value of these securities is expected to recover as the securities approach their stated maturity or repricing date 
the trust preferred securities are all single entity issues that have been impacted by the overall decrease in the financial services market 
for the year ended december   the company recorded an other than temporary impairment otti of million on two securities 
the otti included a million write down resulting from an increase in the credit risk associated with a single entity issued trust preferred security and a write down of million on a fnma perpetual preferred security 
the otti is included as a component of loss on 
table of contents securities  other assets and other real estate owned in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
the company did not recognize an otti in during  other investments increased by million mainly due to federal home loan bank fhlb stock purchases of million and fhlb stock dividends of million

the acquisitions took place on december  and january   respectively 
the increase in intangible assets of million in is due to the acquisition of intangibles from the bda and wagner acquisitions  offset by million in amortization 
the decrease of million in intangibles in was due to amortization 
bank owned life insurance boli increased by million to million at december  as a result of growth in the cash surrender value of the policies 
boli increased million to million at 
table of contents december  the increase was attributed to new boli policies of million and million from the growth in the cash surrender value of the policies 
deferred income taxes increased by million to million at december  the increase was primarily due to the million tax effect of the provision for loan and credit losses 
other assets increased million to million at december  contributing to the increase was the addition of million of oreo  a million increase in the fair value of derivatives  and a million receivable for estimated tax payments made in excess of the tax liability 
the million increase in over was comprised primarily of a million increase in the value of equity method investments 
deposits our primary source of funds has historically been customer deposits 
we offer a variety of accounts for depositors  which are designed to attract both short and long term deposits 
these accounts include certificates of deposit  savings accounts  money market accounts  checking and now accounts  and individual retirement accounts 
during the third quarter of  the company introduced a non collateralized eurodollar sweep product as an alternative to the collateralized customer repurchase product 
eurodollar sweep balances at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
at december   noninterest bearing deposits increased million to million or from we believe we receive a large amount of noninterest bearing deposits because we provide customers with the option of paying for treasury management services in cash or by maintaining additional noninterest bearing account balances 
additionally  the company is currently participating in the tlgp created by the fdic  which provides full coverage for noninterest bearing deposit accounts regardless of the dollar amount 
interest bearing accounts earn interest at rates based on competitive market factors and our desire to increase or decrease certain types of maturities or deposits 
the company had million and million in brokered deposits at december  and  respectively excluding reciprocal certificate of deposit account registry service cdars accounts  which we view as customer related deposits 
brokered deposits are considered a wholesale financing source and are used as an alternative to other short term borrowings

table of contents maturities of certificates of deposit of  and more are as follows in thousands at december  remaining maturity less than three months three months up to six months six months up to one year one year and over total deposits decreased by million to billion at december  the decrease in deposits is mainly due to an decrease of million in brokered deposits and million in now and money market deposits offset by an increase of million in reciprocal cdars 
although the eesa temporarily raised the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage until december   the past year was challenging in terms of deposit generation 
as a business bank  the vast majority of our depositors typically maintain balances in excess of the fdic insurance limits 
as a result  the bank has migrated a significant portion of its core deposits from money market and now accounts into certificates of deposits offered through the cdars program 
deposits increased by million to billion at december  during  the company saw a migration from lower cost deposits into higher cost categories

reported earnings per common share for the year ended december   on a fully diluted basis was  a significant decline from  primarily the result of the provision for loan losses 
net income and earnings per common share declined slightly during compared to  a decrease largely attributed to a  share increase in the weighted average shares outstanding during the increase in shares during was caused by a secondary offering whereby the company sold  shares of common stock 
net interest income 
the largest component of our net income is our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investment securities  and 
table of contents interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
throughout the federal government unveiled many new tools and approaches to deal with the credit and liquidity problems associated with the failure or near failure of several large financial services companies 
however  the fomc has long used and continues to use the target federal funds rate to influence interest rates and the economy 
the target federal funds rate  the interest rate used by banks lending to each other  significantly affects the company s interest rate environment and earnings 
changes in the federal funds rate have a direct correlation to changes in the prime rate  the underlying index for most of the variable rate loans issued by the company 
the target federal funds rate was at the beginning of  the result of eight consecutive rate increases totaling basis points during the fomc raised rates another basis points during the first half of  ending the year at

average interest earning assets grew by million or an increase of during compared to  largely related to growth of million in the average loan portfolio 
however  due to falling rates throughout the yield on the interest earning asset base fell sharply  overshadowing the asset growth 
the impact to the net interest margin of changes in interest earning assets was a decrease of basis points 
loan growth was funded by average interest bearing deposit growth of million and increases in other borrowings of million 
the impact of changes in interest bearing deposits on the net interest margin was an increase of basis points and changes in interest bearing borrowings increased the net interest margin was an additional basis points 
the increasing margin on interest bearing liabilities was largely due to falling interest rates offset by volume increases 
the company s utilization of the federal reserve s taf program positively impacted the net interest margin in this is a temporary program and there is no assurance that it will be available in the long term 
if this program becomes unavailable  our net interest margin may be adversely impacted by shifting to other wholesale sources 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or over the prior year 
the net interest margin increased by basis points from the prior year to 
average interest earning assets increased by million or from the prior year 
the increase was largely related to average loan growth of million  offset by a decrease in the average investment portfolio of million 
the yield on interest earning assets increased by basis points  primarily contributed by loan volume growth basis points  offset by a volume decrease basis points in the investments portfolio 
introduction of the eurodollar deposit product in allowed the company to reduce its investment portfolio as securities matured or were called 
contributions to net interest margin relating to rate changes in the investment portfolio nearly offset the effects of the reduced volume 
average interest earning liabilities also increased during by

the increase was largely related to deposit growth of million  offset by a decrease in short term borrowing and securities sold under agreement to repurchase of million 
the impact of these changes in interest earning liabilities on net interest margin was a decrease of basis points  a change primarily relating to a basis point increase in the cost of deposits offset by a decrease of basis points relating to other borrowings and securities sold under agreement to repurchase 
in order to reduce our asset sensitivity  the company executes an asset liability strategy using interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate loans indexed to prime 
during the company entered into two new swap agreements with a total notional value of million  amortizing over a period of three years 
during  the company entered into five interest rate swaps with a total notional value of million  amortizing over three years 
the company receives a fixed rate and pays a variable rate based on the notional amounts 
the company had million and million in notional values outstanding at december  and  respectively 
the weighted average interest rate paid was versus a weighted average interest rate received of at december  the weighted average interest rate paid was versus a weighted average rate received of at december   during and  the company recognized a basis point increase and a basis point decrease in its net interest margin  respectively  due to the interest rate swaps 
provision and allowance for loan and credit losses 
the provision for loan and credit losses increased by million to million for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses increased by million to million for the year ended december  the increase in was made in recognition of the continued decline in property values  particularly in the arizona market  and the impact to the portfolio of generally negative trends in the local economies the company operates in 
the overall quality of the loan portfolio deteriorated in as nonperforming loans to total loans increased from to 
nonperforming loans totaled million at december  compared to million at december  net charge offs during were million compared to million in the prior year 
charge offs of million came from the arizona portfolio primarily due to five customer relationships 
nonperforming assets have consistently been below industry and peer averages as defined by the ffiec  and management believes the allowance is at a sufficient level to absorb potential losses in the portfolio 
at december   the allowance for loan and credit losses amounted to million  or of nonperforming loans compared to million and of nonperforming loans at december   noninterest income 
the following table presents noninterest income for the years ended december   and for the year ended december  in thousands noninterest income service charges other loan fees investment advisory and trust income insurance income investment banking income other income total noninterest income service charges 
deposit service charges primarily consist of fees earned from our treasury management services 
customers are given the option to pay for these services in cash or by offsetting the fees for these services against an earnings credit that is given for maintaining noninterest bearing deposits 
fees earned from treasury management services will fluctuate based on the number of customers using the services and from changes in us treasury rates which are used as a benchmark for the earnings credit rate 
other miscellaneous deposit charges are transactional by nature and may not 
table of contents be consistent period over period 
the increase in is attributed to a decrease in the earnings credit rate that has fallen due to a decrease in the us treasury rate 
as the earnings credit rate decreases  the amount of cash fees paid for service charges increases 
the increase in over was due to higher customer utilization of our treasury management services 
investment advisory and trust income 
investment advisory and trust income for increased by million or over the prior year 
investment advisory and trust income for increased million  or  to million 
at december   the company acquired wagner whose results are included in but not any earlier period 
the acquisition of wagner represented million of the total increase  which was offset by a decrease in revenue from the company s existing investment management portfolio 
revenues from this source are generally a function of the value of assets under management 
market changes will have a positive or negative impact on the earnings of the companies operating in this business line 
revenues from the segment were adversely impacted by market events in  when the s p was down and the dow jones industrial average was down 
discretionary assets under management at december  were million  a decrease from total assets under management  custodial assets and assets under advisement at december  were billion 
to the extent that the debt and equity markets continue to fall  revenue maintenance and generation in this segment will be challenging 
insurance income 
insurance income is derived from three main areas  wealth transfer  benefits consulting and p c 
the majority of fees earned on wealth transfer transactions are earned at the inception of the product offering in the form of commissions 
as the fees on these products are transactional by nature  fee income can fluctuate from period to period based on the number of transactions that have been closed 
revenue from benefits consulting and p c are more recurring revenue sources 
insurance income for increased million from to million for the year ended december  the change largely relates to the acquisition of cobiz insurance arizona which contributed million in its first year of operating as a cobiz financial company 
insurance income derived from wealth transfer cases increased million in over as noted below  in there were a number of cases that were adversely impacted in the medical underwriting stages 
insurance income for decreased by million  or  from million in the decrease in the period is largely attributable to a decline in revenues from the wealth management unit which saw a number of large cases fail to close during the year due to medical underwriting issues 
income from the segment was also negatively impacted by continued softening of p c premiums directly affecting commissions earned by cobiz insurance 
investment banking income 
investment banking income includes retainer fees which are recognized over the expected term of the engagement and success fees which are recognized when the transaction is completed and collectibility of fees is reasonably assured 
investment banking income is transactional by nature and will fluctuate based on the number of clients engaged and transactions successfully closed 
the company believes it has a significant pipeline of potential transactions though marketing and closing transactions could be challenging for the foreseeable future until credit loosens and merger and acquisition activity gains momentum 
revenues for the investment banking unit fell by million to million for the year ended december  credit tightening throughout had an impact on the segment s results as its clients acquisition and sales transactions are highly dependent on financing arrangements 
scarce financing coupled with declining valuations caused a number of engagements to be put on hold until conditions improve 
investment banking income for grew slightly from  up million or 

table of contents other income 
other income is comprised of changes in the cash surrender value of boli  earnings on equity method investments  merchant charges  bankcard fees  wire transfer fees  foreign exchange fees and safe deposit income 
other income for grew by million for the year ended december   or over other income for showed modest growth of million  or  from the growth stems from a million increase in earnings in income from equity method investments  a million increase in income from the increase in cash surrender value in boli and a million increase in transaction fees earned on the sale of customer interest rate swaps 
equity method investments are comprised of interests in mezzanine partnerships 
earnings on our equity method investments are primarily impacted by the mezzanine funds sale of portfolio companies they own an interest in  which are not regular  recurring events 
other sources of income were relatively stable compared to the increase in other income for was largely due to earnings on equity method investments  which contributed approximately million to income  an increase of million compared to noninterest expense

table of contents and averaged or million 
the company also had a million increase in incentive compensation during these increases were offset by a million decrease in compensation paid to commissionable employees  a million decrease in health medical costs and a net decrease of million in other salary and benefit expenses 
the decrease in compensation paid to commissionable employees is consistent with the decrease in revenue in our insurance segment 
the decrease in health medical costs during was due to a low level of claims experience that passes through to the company since we are partially self insured 
stock based compensation 
the company adopted sfas r on january   which requires recognition of compensation costs associated with the grant date fair value of awards issued after the adoption date and for the portion of awards for which the requisite service period had not previously been rendered 
costs increased million during the year as a result of new awards 
the increase in expense of million in over was also due to additional stock option grants awarded during the year 
the weighted average fair value of awards issued in was per share and the weighted average fair value of the awards was per share 
the company uses stock based compensation to retain existing employees  recruit new employees and is considered an important part of overall compensation 
the company expects to continue using stock based compensation in the future 
occupancy costs 
occupancy costs for the year ended december  increased by million versus increases of million and million in and the acquisitions of cobiz insurance arizona and wagner contributed approximately million to the occupancy cost increase 
two de novo locations that were not fully operational in also increased expense by million 
maintenance costs  primarily related to computer systems  increased million and depreciation on computer hardware and software deployed in increased million 
the company also expanded its leased premises at the company headquarters at th st  denver  co  which increased occupancy costs by million 
the increase in related to an increase in rent expense on newly leased facilities and leases that adjust annually and maintenance contracts  offset by decreases in depreciation on software and hardware that had reached the end of their depreciable lives 
loss on securities  other assets and oreo 
loss on securities  other assets and oreo increased million during the year ended december  to million 
losses in the current year include million related to the sale and valuation adjustment of oreo  otti charges on a single issuer trust preferred security of million and a write down of the remaining value of a fnma perpetual preferred security of million 
the million loss in was due to a million loss on the sale of repossessed assets and million related to the loss on sale and call of investment securities 
the million loss in was related to a rebalancing of our investment portfolio where we sold certain securities and purchased other shorter term securities and reduced our wholesale funding 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses for the year ended december  increased by million or over the prior year 
other operating expenses for increased million  or  to million compared to other operating expense is comprised of marketing  office supplies  professional services  correspondent banking charges  regulatory assessments and operational losses 
the increase was primarily due to workout expenses on problem loans and repossessed property of million and increases in service contracts and courier expense of million 
regulatory fees and deposit insurance costs are expected to rise significantly in due to the additional coverage limits obtained through the fdic 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase in professional services of million  marketing and branding initiatives of million and regulatory assessments of million 
professional services increased primarily due to third party referral fees paid on investment banking transactions  expenses for investment advisory back office support  and accounting and legal costs 
marketing increased as a result of initiatives to increase our loan and deposit bases and grow our fee based business lines 
costs for the branding initiative related to the unification of the cobiz name across all of the company s subsidiaries 

table of contents the increase in regulatory assessments was primarily caused by the fdic s increase in assessment rates 
federal income taxes 
the net income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million 
the provision for income taxes totaled million during  compared to million in the effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the tax benefit in is due to the effect of tax exempt income that reduced our taxable income to a net tax loss 
the effect of permanent tax differences  such as tax exempt income  was amplified in due to the decrease in reported pre tax income 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to the company s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet financial obligations to its customers and shareholders in order to fund loans  to respond to deposit outflows and to cover operating expenses 
maintaining a level of liquid funds through asset liability management seeks to ensure that these needs are met at a reasonable cost 
liquidity is essential to compensate for fluctuations in the balance sheet and provide funds for growth and normal operating expenditures 
sources of funds include customer deposits  scheduled amortization of loans  loan prepayments  scheduled maturities of investments and cash flows from mortgage backed securities 
liquidity needs may also be met by deposit growth  converting assets into cash  raising funds in the brokered certificate of deposit market or borrowing using lines of credit with correspondent banks  the fhlb  the frb or the treasury 
longer term liquidity needs may be met by selling securities available for sale or raising additional capital 
liquidity management is the process by which the company manages the continuing flow of funds necessary to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost 
our liquidity management objective is to ensure our ability to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and to allow us to sustain our operations 
these funding commitments include withdrawals by depositors  credit commitments to borrowers  shareholder dividends  expenses of its operations and capital expenditures 
liquidity is monitored and closely managed by the company s asset and liability committee alco  a group of senior officers from the lending  deposit gathering  finance and treasury areas 
alco s primary responsibilities are to ensure the necessary level of funds are available for normal operations as well as maintain a contingency funding policy to ensure that liquidity stress events are quickly identified and management plans are in place to respond 
this is accomplished through the use of policies which establish limits and require measurements to monitor liquidity trends  including management reporting that identifies the amounts and costs of all available funding sources 
the company s current liquidity position is expected to be more than adequate to fund expected asset growth 
historically  our primary source of funds has been customer deposits 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and unscheduled loan prepayments which are influenced by fluctuations in the general level of interest rates  returns available on other investments  competition  economic conditions  and other factors are less predictable 
available funding through correspondent lines at december   totaled million  which represents of the company s earning assets 
total available funding of million is comprised of million in available federal funds purchased lines and million in fhlb borrowing capacity 
in addition  the company had million in securities available to be pledged for collateral for additional fhlb borrowings and taf borrowings at december  liquidity from asset categories is provided through cash and interest bearing deposits with other banks  which totaled million at december   compared to million at december  additional asset liquidity sources include principal and interest payments from securities in the company s investment portfolio and cash flows from its amortizing loan portfolio 
liability liquidity sources include attracting deposits at competitive rates 
core deposits represented and  respectively  of our total deposits balance of billion and billion at december  
table of contents and december   respectively 
despite government efforts to bolster consumer confidence in the banking system and the marketplace through the implementation of programs such as the eesa  which temporarily raised the limit on federal deposit insurance and the tlgp  which provides full coverage for noninterest bearing transaction deposit accounts  last year proved to be challenging in terms of deposit generation 
growth in average core deposits was not sufficient to fund loan growth of million or during thus  the company has turned to the use of alternative funding sources 
the company uses various forms of short term borrowings for cash management and liquidity purposes 
these forms of borrowings include federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  borrowings from the fhlb and revolving lines of credit 
at december   the bank has approved unsecured federal funds purchase lines with correspondent banks with an aggregate credit line of million 
the company regularly uses its federal funds purchase lines to manage its daily cash position 
however  availability to access funds through those lines is dependent upon the cash position of the correspondent banks and there may be times when certain lines are not available 
in addition  certain lines require a one day rest period after a specified number of consecutive days of accessing the lines 
with the overall tightening in the credit markets  certain correspondent lines have been reduced or may not be available due to liquidity issues specific to our correspondents 
during  the company s aggregate correspondent credit lines decreased by million 
as a result  the company has shifted additional loans and investments as collateral to the fhlb to increase the company s borrowing capacity 
the bank also has a line of credit from the fhlb that is limited by the amount of eligible collateral available to secure it 
borrowings under the fhlb line are required to be secured by unpledged securities and qualifying loans 
borrowings may also be used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending activities and to match the maturity or repricing intervals of assets 
the company participated in the us treasury s term investment option tio program for treasury tax and loan participants 
the tio program allowed us to obtain additional short term funds at a rate determined through an auction process that is limited by the amount of eligible collateral available to secure it 
however  the treasury department suspended the tio program for the foreseeable future 
the company also was approved to participate in the federal reserve s term auction facility taf to provide additional liquidity 
under the taf  the federal reserve auctions term funds to depository institutions 
advances are for a fixed amount  with the rate determined by an auction process  and must be fully collateralized 
at december   the company had million outstanding under the taf at a weighted average interest rate of with a term of less than days 
the company had approximately million available in loans to pledge as collateral for additional funding under the taf 
the company intends to continue pursuing funding via the taf 
at the holding company level  our primary sources of funds are dividends paid from the bank and fee based subsidiaries  management fees assessed to the bank and the fee based business lines  proceeds from the issuance of common stock  and other capital markets activity 
the main use of this liquidity is the quarterly payment of dividends on our common stock  quarterly interest payments on the subordinated debentures and notes payable  payments for mergers and acquisitions activity including potential earn out payments  and payments for the salaries and benefits for the employees of the holding company 
the approval of the colorado state banking board is required prior to the declaration of any dividend by the bank if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with the retained net profits for the preceding two years 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of provides that the bank cannot pay a dividend if it will cause the bank to be undercapitalized 
the company s ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends upon the availability of dividends from the bank  earnings from its fee based businesses  and upon the company s compliance with the capital adequacy guidelines of the frb 
see item business supervision and regulation and note to the consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the compliance of the bank and cobiz with applicable capital adequacy guidelines 
the company also has a million revolving line of credit agreement that matures on july  that is subject to certain financial covenants 
at december   the company was in default on two covenants  the minimum return on asset ratio and the maximum non performing asset to total loans ratio 
pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  these events of default provide the lender the right to 
table of contents declare all amounts under the agreement as immediately due and payable 
in addition  the lender s obligation to advance amounts available pursuant to the agreement is terminated 
at december   the revolving line of credit s outstanding balance was although  the company has not been notified by the lender that the revolving line of credit agreement has been terminated due to the events of default  the company is not relying on the line of credit for its liquidity management purposes 
our primary source of shareholders equity is the retention of our net after tax earnings and proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
at december  shareholders equity totaled million  a million increase from december  the increase was primarily due to the issuance and sale of  shares of preferred stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock to the us treasury department as part of the capital purchase program for million 
also contributing to the increase in equity was million in net income  million of stock options  excess tax benefits on option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activity  and an increase of million in accumulated other comprehensive income due mainly to net unrealized gains in the derivatives portfolio 
the increases in equity were offset by dividend payments of million in the company successfully completed a private placement of million of subordinated unsecured promissory notes during the third and fourth quarters of proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate purposes 
the notes qualify as tier capital for regulatory capital purposes 
management believes the company continues to have good internal capital generation to support its operations 
we currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents  expected cash flows from operations together with alternative sources of funding ie taf are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  loan originations  capital expenditures and other obligations for at least the next months 
we continually monitor existing and alternative financing sources to support our capital and liquidity needs  including but not limited to  debt issuance  common stock issuance and deposit funding sources 
based on our current financial condition and our results of operations  we believe that the company will be able to sustain its ability to raise adequate capital through one of these financing sources 
on november   the company filed a universal shelf registration that allows the company to issue any combination of debt securities  preferred stock  depositary shares  common stock and securities warrants from time to time in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of million 
a new universal shelf registration was filed on january  to allow for the sale of common stock by affiliates of the company and the original universal shelf registration was withdrawn 
on january   pursuant to the universal shelf registration  we sold  shares of common stock at a public offering price of 
in conjunction with the offering  our ceo  one member of our board of directors and the estate of one former member of our board of directors selling shareholders sold  shares of common stock 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling shareholders 
on july   the company s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to of its outstanding stock 
share repurchases under this program were to made through open market purchases  block trades or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time and in compliance with rule b under the exchange act 
the program concluded on november   when all authorized shares had been repurchased 
the shares were repurchased at a weighted average price of and a total cost of million 
we are subject to minimum risk based capital limitations as set forth by federal banking regulations at both the consolidated company level and the bank level 
under the risk based capital guidelines  different categories of assets  including certain off balance sheet items  such as loan commitments in excess of one year and letters of credit  are assigned different risk weights  based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset 
these risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a risk weighted asset base 
for purposes of the risk based capital guidelines  total capital is defined as the sum of tier and tier capital elements  with tier capital being limited to of tier capital 
tier capital includes  with certain restrictions  common shareholders equity  perpetual 
table of contents preferred stock and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries 
tier capital includes  with certain limitations  perpetual preferred stock not included in tier capital  certain maturing capital instruments  and the allowance for loan and credit losses 
at december   the bank was well capitalized with a tier capital ratio of  and total capital ratio of 
the minimum ratios to be considered well capitalized under the risk based capital standards are and  respectively 
at the holding company level  the company s tier capital ratio at december   was  and its total capital ratio 
total risk based capital for the consolidated company increased by million during the majority of the increase is attributed to the million investment received from the treasury department as part of the cpp and to a million private offering of subordinated notes payable raised in the third and fourth quarters that qualifies as tier capital 
in order to comply with the regulatory capital constraints  the company and its board of directors constantly monitor the capital level and its anticipated needs based on the company s growth 
the company has identified sources of additional capital that could be used if needed  and monitors the costs and benefits of these sources  which include both the public and private markets 
the company has issued a total of million of trust preferred securities through statutory trusts that are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
although the accounts of the trusts are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements  all of the million in trust preferred securities issued by the trusts are included in tier capital for regulatory capital purposes as allowed by the frb 
on february   the frb finalized a rule that would continue to allow the inclusion of trust preferred securities issued by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts in tier capital  but with stricter quantitative and qualitative standards 
under the rule  after a transition period ending on march   the aggregate amount of trust preferred securities and certain other capital elements would be limited to of tier capital elements  net of goodwill that has been reduced by any associated deferred tax liability 
the amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit could be included in tier capital  subject to restrictions 
based on the final rule  the company s allowable trust preferred securities in tier capital would decrease if it had been in effect at december  the additional amount excluded from tier capital would be included in tier capital and the company would still be adequately capitalized 
the company s condensed consolidated financial statements do not reflect various off balance sheet commitments that are made in the normal course of business  which may involve some liquidity risk 
off balance sheet arrangements are discussed in the contractual obligations and commitments section following 
the company has commitments to extend credit under lines of credit and stand by letters of credit 
the company has also committed to investing in certain partnerships 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on these commitments 
contractual obligations and commitments summarized below are the company s contractual obligations excluding deposit liabilities to make future payments at december

interest reported above was calculated at the actual borrowing rates at december  interest rates paid on junior subordinated debentures are variable rates and actual interest payments will differ based on actual libor and actual amounts outstanding for the applicable periods

cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series b issued to the us treasury december includes dividends payable at on  the preferred shares are shown in the table as being due in the after three but within five years category 
this assumes the  in preferred stock will be redeemed in the year prior to the step up to for the dividend rate 
the company has employed a strategy to expand its offering of fee based products through the acquisition of entities that complement its business model 
we will often structure the purchase price of an acquired entity to include an earn out  which is a contingent payment based on achieving future performance levels 
given the uncertainty of today s economic climate and the performance challenges it creates for companies  we feel the use of earn outs in acquisitions is an effective method to bridge the expectation gap between a buyer s caution and a seller s optimism 
earn outs help to protect buyers from paying a full valuation up front without the assurance of the acquisition s performance  while allowing sellers to participate in the full value of the company provided the anticipated performance does occur 
since the earn out payments are determined based on the acquired company s performance during the earn out period  the total payments to be made are not known at the time of the acquisition 
the company has committed to make additional earn out payments to the former owners of wagner based on earnings and performance 
at december   the company did not accrue for any earn out payments for the fiscal year the company  at the time of the purchase of the assets of bda  placed into escrow  as deferred purchase price that could be earned by achieving certain agreed upon performance measures over the two year period following the acquisition 
at december   it was determined the unit had met the first of two performance measures and in january  of the deferred purchase price was released to the former owners 
the contractual amount of the company s financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  expiring by period at december   is presented below 
table of contents in thousands within one year after one but within three years after three but within five years after five years total unfunded loan commitments standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit unfunded commitments for unconsolidated investments company guarantees total commitments the company is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the liquidity  credit enhancement and financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet 
credit risk is the principal risk associated with these instruments 
the contractual amounts of these instruments represent the amount of credit risk should the instruments be fully drawn upon and the customer defaults 
to control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit  the company uses the same credit quality  collateral policies and monitoring controls in making commitments and letters of credit as it does with its lending activities 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation 
legally binding commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit obligate the company to meet certain financial obligations of its customers if  under the contractual terms of the agreement  the customers are unable to do so 
the financial standby letters of credit issued by the company are irrevocable 
payment is only guaranteed under these letters of credit upon the borrower s failure to perform its obligations to the beneficiary 
approximately million of total commitments at december   represent commitments to extend credit at fixed rates of interest  which exposes the company to some degree of interest rate risk 
the company has also entered into interest rate swap agreements under which it is required to either receive or pay cash to a counterparty depending on changes in interest rates 
the interest rate swaps are carried at their fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates at the balance sheet date 
interest rate swaps recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at december   do not represent amounts that will ultimately be received or paid under the contract and are therefore excluded from the table above 
effects of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs 
unlike most retail or manufacturing companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution such as the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  the impact of interest rates on a financial institution s performance is generally greater than the impact of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or to the same extent  as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as inflation 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management asset liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of repricing assets compared to liabilities 
it is our objective to generate stable growth in net interest income and to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  our strategy is to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income by maintaining a favorable match between the maturities or repricing dates of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we adjust interest sensitivity during the year through changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
our asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the asset liability management committee  in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors of the bank 
this committee meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
the asset liability committee also approves and establishes pricing and funding decisions with respect to our overall asset and liability composition 
the committee reviews our liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of investments  deposits and borrowings  deposit activity  current market conditions  and general levels of interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  we use simulation analysis to determine the impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various interest rate scenarios 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the following table presents an analysis of the interest rate sensitivity inherent in our net interest income and market value of equity 
the interest rate scenario presented in the table includes interest rates at december   as adjusted by instantaneous rate changes upward of up to basis points 
due to the current interest rate environment the fomc has a basis point target federal funds rate at december  with prime set at basis points above the fomc target the downward movement analysis was limited to a basis point change 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  this analysis is not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates 
the market value sensitivity analysis presented includes assumptions that i the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at december   will remain constant over the month measurement period  and ii that changes in market rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve regardless of duration or repricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
further  the analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on us 
change in interest rates in basis points impact on net interest income n a market value of equity n a our results of operations depend significantly on net interest income 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions and by competition in the marketplace 
rising and falling interest rate environments can have various impacts on net interest income  depending on the interest rate profile ie  the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the relative changes in interest rates that occur when various assets and liabilities reprice  unscheduled repayments of loans and investments  early withdrawals of deposits  and other factors 
as a general rule  banks with positive interest rate gaps are more likely to be susceptible to declines in net interest income in periods of falling interest rates  while banks with negative interest rate gaps are more likely to experience declines in net interest income in periods of rising interest rates 
at december   our cumulative interest rate gap was a positive 
table of contents 
therefore  assuming no change in our gap position  a rise in interest rates is likely to result in increased net interest income  while a decline in interest rates is likely to result in decreased net interest income 
this is a point in time position that is continually changing and is not indicative of our position at any other time 
while the gap position is a useful tool in measuring interest rate risk and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change 
consequently  in addition to gap analysis  we use the simulation model discussed above to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing  and the resulting interest rate gap  of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  all amounts in the table are based on contractual repricing schedules 
actual prepayment and withdrawal experience may vary significantly from the assumptions reflected in the table

our asset liability management committee is responsible for establishing procedures that enable us to achieve our goals while adhering to prudent banking practices and existing loan and investment policies 
we have focused on maintaining balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and repricing frequencies 
an important element of this focus has been to emphasize variable rate loans and investments funded by deposits that also mature or reprice over periods of months or less 

table of contents the following table presents  at december   loans by maturity in each major category of our portfolio 
actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are evaluated in the same manner as new credit applications 
at december  less than one to over in thousands one year five years five years total commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer other total loans of the million of loans with maturities of one year or more  approximately million were fixed rate loans and million were variable rate loans at december  to augment our asset and liability management strategy  we also began using interest rate swaps in  with the overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest margin 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts 
since we implemented the program in  we have entered into different interest rate swap agreements  seven of which were outstanding at december  under the interest rate swap agreements  we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate based on the prime rate 
the swaps qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and are designated as hedges of the variability of cash flows we receive from certain of our prime indexed loans 
in accordance with sfas  these swap agreements are measured at fair value and reported as assets or liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
the portion of the change in the fair value of the swaps that is deemed effective in hedging the cash flows of the designated assets are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax effects oci and reclassified into interest income when such cash flows occur in the future 
any ineffectiveness resulting from the hedges is recorded as a gain or loss in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income as a part of noninterest income

in february  the company initiated a new series of interest rate swap transactions designated as cash flow hedges 
the intent of the transactions are to fix the effective interest rate of payments due on 
table of contents its junior subordinated debentures with the objective of reducing the company s exposure to adverse changes in cash flows relating to payments on its libor based floating rate debt 
the swap agreements having a total notional value of million will fix the interest rates between and and mature over varying lengths of time from five and years
