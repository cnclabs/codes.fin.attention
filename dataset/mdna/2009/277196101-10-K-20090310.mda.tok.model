critical accounting policies general our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
for example  we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ substantially from the historical factors that we use 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when their occurrence is probable and estimable and ii sfas no  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of the collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
we evaluate non performing loans individually for impairment  such as nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management as required by sfas no 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of the impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment under sfas no 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  we make estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by sfas no 
loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon 
table of contents historical loss rates for each loan type  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimates of losses for groups of loans are adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans including borrower or industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending staff  and national and local economic conditions 
the amounts of estimated losses for loans individually evaluated for impairment and groups of loans are added together for a total estimate of loan losses 
the estimate of losses is compared to our allowance for loan losses as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses is greater than the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be considered 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether a reduction to the allowance would be necessary 
while management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the valuations 
such adjustments would be made in the relevant period and may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill goodwill is evaluated annually to see if there is any impairment associated with its value 
refer to footnote  item goodwill on page executive overview the year was not a normal year in the banking industry 
it showed the falling domino impact of loan instruments that are used to collateralize investment instruments and then sold to various institutions 
although we did not deal in subprime loans as a matter of direct business  we still were impacted 
the year began with the financial industry  not just banks  continuing to deal with the subprime loan fallout 
the federal reserve continued to lower rates through out the year which put a squeeze on interest margins  the largest contributor to our net income  as variable rate loans and investments re priced quickly while fixed rate deposits and borrowings re priced over a longer period of time 
finally in late summer the impact of the decreased value of asset backed securities  the high rate of defaulted mortgages and a liquidity crunch blended to cause massive write downs of securities  the takeover by the u 
s 
government of its mortgage agencies fnma and fhlmc and the buy out or failure of many institutions 
this brought in the u 
s 
treasury to assist the federal reserve and other government supervisory agencies in stabilizing the economy 
as we enter  we are operating under a quasi government controlled financial industry that is working hard to right itself 
eastern virginia bankshares was not immune to these impacts 
we had to take an impairment charge to write down some securities  primarily preferred stock of fnma and fhlmc 
when the treasury secretary acted to place the fnma and fhlmc government sponsored entities gse s into conservatorship  banks holding the securities were negatively impacted 
only a few months prior to the treasury action  banking regulators had encouraged banks to incorporate these securities in the mix of their portfolio holdings to assist in meeting capital needs of these gse s 
the result was that all financial institutions that held investments in the gse s were forced to take impairment charges that negatively impacted earnings 
in addition  we have an increased volume of loans in nonaccrual status and subject to foreclosure risks 
however  we have maintained a conservative strategy  risks within our markets are diversified  we are still earning net income and most important we are well capitalized with enough liquidity to meet most turns in the economic markets 
our balance sheet  the primary driver of income  grew in total assets are up million from at the end of to billion at the end of gross loans  our primary earning asset  are up million and deposits are up million while fed funds purchased are down at year end by million 
fhlb borrowing increased million from a transaction early in the first quarter of as a result of this growth  if we were in a normal economic market  we start with the potential to produce a good earnings flow 
with the 
table of contents economic turmoil  the potential might not come to fruition 
our growth was not just from branch purchases 
while our branch purchases provided and million in loans and deposits  respectively  we still had significant growth from our existing markets 
loans increased an additional million 
the additional million in deposits includes the addition of some low rate of brokered deposits 
however  the deposit mix started changing with increases in interest checking and money market accounts 
in addition  there was little run off from the acquired branches 
the limitations on the earnings potential will be similar to those we faced in we begin the year with an economy still sliding and a hope that it will bottom out sooner than later 
we anticipate weakened loan payment flows due to continued unemployment increases  creating a nervous public that is still looking for stability in the markets 
net income for the year ended december was million or a decrease from million for the year ended december this was the result of a number of factors 
our income on earning assets increased as loans and securities income were up while fed funds and dividend income were down 
dividends were impacted by lower payments from the fhlb of atlanta  including the fourth quarter dividend being deferred to the infusion of deposits from our purchase of two millennium bank branches helped fuel our funding needs for much of the second and third quarters  but our loan growth put us in a borrowing position by the end of the year 
rate changes through out the year were the primary cause of the declining interest income 
the yield on earning assets dropped basis points for the year while the yield on interest bearing liabilities was down only basis points 
this point gap represents the rate change delay banks have in a declining rate environment 
while the rate gap is the major factor in s interest income weakening it is not the only factor in earnings decline 
the provision for loan losses increased from million in to in  taking an additional million out of earnings for in addition  the competition for deposits has become extremely aggressive 
this is pointed out in the trend of our net interest margin 
in  our net interest margin was while in it was 
the rate has declined every year except when it was up basis points 
management  in an effort to minimize this trend  looks at funding alternatives outside the traditional deposit sources and makes purchases of borrowed funds or brokered deposits when the spreads are significantly better than the normal deposit market 
noninterest income was million for  a decrease of million compared to million in the decline was influenced by a number of unusual items that skew the year to year comparison 
our core noninterest income for was million  an increase of  compared to the unusual items that impacted noninterest income creating a net loss of million were a million other than temporary impairment  partially offset by a million pension curtailment gain 
the securities loss resulted primarily from the impairment charge taken on the fnma and fhlmc preferred stock when the federal government took control of the agencies and eliminated the dividend 
the economy is still in turmoil  but with the infusion of government money into the economy  we anticipate that it will eventually reverse these negative trends 
this should occur as the funds move out to businesses that can then hire employees and start producing goods again and as the consumers move back into the work force and begin to feel more comfortable with spending 
our current view of the economy does not permit us to provide an estimate of when the turn around is likely to occur 
noninterest expense rose for the year due to infrastructure changes in the telecommunications system  higher fdic insurance premiums due to a revised pricing structure but primarily from the acquisition of two new branches in the middle of march the purchase  as mentioned  helped fund our loan growth during the year  but did add noninterest expense 
our analysis of the performance of the acquired branches indicated that the acquisition was accretive to with strong expense controls and a freeze on merit increases in  we expect noninterest expense increases in to only be related to non controllable items such as fdic insurance  postage  telecommunications and legal expenses related to loan defaults 

table of contents management s announced strategy of growing net income annually by is primarily dependent on growth of our existing markets and positioning the company to grow in new markets 
this strategy is emphasized by the progression over the last six years but in an economy that we are facing now  an economy never seen by most bankers in their careers  that goal takes a secondary position to our focus to help and work with our customers and our communities 
until the economy reverses direction  growth will probably be limited 
however  while we do not plan any new branch openings in  we are open to opportunities that may present themselves 
if these opportunities arise  we will evaluate them and will act to enhance shareholder value 
in light of the current economic conditions  our primary goal in is to maintain the stability of our company and assist our customers and communities

interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income after provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense income before applicable income taxes applicable income taxes net income net income per share  basic and diluted net interest income the primary source of income for our company is net interest income which represents our gross profit margin and is defined as the difference between interest income and interest expense 
for comparative purposes  income from tax exempt securities is adjusted to a tax equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 
tax exempt securities income is further adjusted by the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act tefra adjustment for the disallowance as a deduction of a portion of total interest expense related to the ratio of average tax exempt securities to average total assets 
by making these adjustments  tax exempt income and their yields are presented on a comparable basis with income and yields from fully taxable earning assets 
net interest margin is a ratio based on the formula of net interest income divided by average earning assets that represents the profits left over after paying for deposits and borrowed funds 
changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income

table of contents tax equivalent net interest income decreased to million in from million in average earning assets grew  or million  while interest bearing liabilities grew  or million 
despite growth on both sides of the balance sheet  the yield on earning assets was a decline of basis points compared to a cost of on interest bearing liabilities which was down basis points 
in spite of the growth  the earnings on the loan portfolio were unable to hold pace with the rapid interest decreases throughout and the spread declined basis points 
this displays the re pricing gap that existed most of the year as the federal reserve s rapid price cuts to fight economic problems created a disparity by re pricing variable rate loans right away while not impacting fixed rate liabilities until their maturity 
all categories of earning assets grew except federal funds sold 
average securities were up million with a million increase in taxable securities and a million increase in tax exempt securities 
taxable securities income went up contributing thousand more to interest income  while tax exempt income was up thousand 
this increase of million more than offset the decline of thousand in federal funds sold earnings 
the yield on the largest earning asset category  loans  was down basis points at compared to in total average deposits grew million  or  with increases in all categories except demand deposits and savings which continued their decline as consumers continued to move to interest bearing checking and money market savings 
for  interest bearing checking was again our fastest grower with a million increase and a basis point increase in interest cost at for this category is comprised mostly of our reward checking product with its above market interest rate and demonstrates customers interest in better returns on their deposit funds 
interest bearing checking is of our total average interest bearing deposits 
consumer certificates comprising of our average interest bearing deposit base grew million 
balance changes were influenced by a higher level of brokered deposits 
the cost of both certificate categories decreased from to for large cd s and from to for consumer certificates 
despite the lower rates  the dollar amount of interest on large cd s went up thousand while consumer cd s went down thousand 
while rates went down  large cd s grew million dollars from million in to million in this rate decline is the result of market rate decreases 
average noninterest bearing demand deposits decreased million compared to in  average earning asset growth of resulted from an increase in average loans outstanding of  average federal funds sold increased and average securities increased 
growth in average earning assets of million was primarily funded by average deposit growth of million and an increase in average borrowings of million 
in  net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased to million from million in average earning asset growth of produced million of increased interest income  while interest bearing liabilities grew producing a million increase in interest expense

interest sensitivity our primary goals in interest rate risk management are to minimize negative fluctuations in net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets and to increase the dollar amount of net interest income at a growth rate consistent with the growth rate of total assets 
these goals are accomplished by managing the interest sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities in a specific time interval 
interest sensitivity gap is managed by balancing the volume of floating rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating rate assets  by keeping the fixed rate average maturity of asset and liability contracts reasonably consistent and short  and by routinely adjusting pricing to market conditions on a regular basis 
we generally strive to maintain a position flexible enough to move to equality between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  which may be desirable when there are wide and frequent fluctuations in interest rates 
matching the amount of assets and liabilities maturing in the same time interval helps to hedge interest rate risk and to minimize the impact on net interest income in periods of rising or falling interest rates 
interest rate gaps are managed through investments  loan pricing and deposit pricing 
when an unacceptable positive gap within a one year time frame occurs maturities can be extended by selling shorter term investments and purchasing longer maturities 
when an unacceptable negative gap occurs  variable rate loans can be increased and more investment in shorter term investments can be made 
managing the interest rate gap in an environment where rates have fallen so quickly presents management with different challenges 
depositors are uncertain about where to put their money  especially with the probability of a continuation of the current economic recession 
we anticipate more funds coming to us as customers look for safer 
table of contents investments but that will take time 
currently  we have almost a third of our loan portfolio repricing almost instantly with each rate cut 
however  our deposits  especially certificates  do not reprice until they mature which results in a short term narrowing of earnings 
we saw clear evidence of this in late when our daily interest income decreased over  per day with each basis point change 
in a day horizon the balance sheet is asset sensitive  but we are slightly liability sensitive in a one year time frame 
this means we have a large number of deposits repricing later in the next year and will have to look for lower cost funding in the short term to support asset growth 
noninterest income noninterest income for was million  a decrease of million or compared to this decline was primarily the result of a number of non core financial events during the year

debit and atm activity fees were driven by higher volume as consumers moved to electronic transactions rather than checks 
other operating income was impacted by decreases of thousand in investment services income and thousand in evb mortgage  inc income and increases of thousand in bank owned life insurance boli income and thousand in wire transfer fees 
llc investments and fixed asset sales increased thousand primarily from a one time benefit from the exchange of our ownership in bankers investment for a similar interest in infinex

fdic expense rose thousand as the impact of the increased fdic rate structure was implemented 
fdic expense will have a greater increase in marketing and advertising expense increased thousand with much of that related to the opening of the new branches 
loan expenses were up thousand  primarily from increases of thousand in collection expense  thousand in oreo expense on foreclosed properties and thousand in home equity line heloc closing expenses 
legal expenses were up thousand  audit fees were up thousand and director fees were down thousand 
legal fees were from two sources an increase in assistance with loan situations and the fees associated with tarp filings 
we changed our approach to marketing from the traditional mass media to more local involvement 
these changes reflect the tightened economy and the increased effort to collect our outstanding payments on loans 
heloc costs increased as we focused on growth in that loan category

loan portfolio loans  net of unearned income  increased to million at december   an increase of million  or  from million at year end the real estate loan portfolio continued to drive growth in  increasing million  or  with the commercial  industrial and agricultural loan portfolio increasing by million  or  and consumer loans declining by million  or 
consumer loan balances continue a declining trend with being an anomaly with a slight gain 
the gains in loan balances are attributable to two factors one the purchase of two branches and the other continued steady growth in our markets  especially in our gloucester and richmond areas 
the acquisition of branches included million in loans  primarily real estate secured while our existing markets brought in another million 
real estate construction loans grew million  or  while commercial real estate loans grew million  or 
this growth continued through the fourth quarter but at a slower pace as the economic downturn accelerated 
at year end  loans  net of unearned income  were million  up million or from million at year end loan growth for all periods reported was primarily driven by increases in the real estate portfolio 
in the fourth quarter of  the company performed a loan scrub of all loan categories which resulted in some movement from category to category 
the changes put us in position to more effectively report our loan categories based on federal reserve definitions 
the following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio at the dates indicated 
at december dollars in thousands commercial  industrial and agricultural loans residential real estate mortgage real estate construction commercial real estate consumer loans all other loans total loans less unearned income total loans net of unearned discount less allowance for loan losses net loans the following table presents loan categories that are particularly sensitive to rate changes remaining maturities of selected loans variable rate fixed rate year ended december  in thousands within year to years after years total to years after years total total maturities commercial agricultural real estate construction 
table of contents loans secured by real estate comprised approximately of our loan portfolio at december  within this category  residential real estate mortgages made up of the loan portfolio at year end  at december  and at year end while the percentage to total loan portfolio are similar each year  in residential real estate mortgages grew million  or 
this was the largest growth in any single loan category for the year and was supplemented by purchases from our mortgage company and our branch acquisition 
as a percentage of the portfolio  commercial real estate loans increased from of the total loan portfolio at year end to at year end real estate construction loans grew over balances and accounted for of total loans outstanding at year end compared to at year end and at year end our losses on loans secured by real estate have historically been low  averaging thousand in net charge offs per year over the last ten years 
in the shaky real estate market where valuations are dropping  management takes these changed risks into consideration in assessing our loan to value exposure 
consumer loans are again the fifth largest component of our loan portfolio in comprising of the portfolio at year end compared to at year end and at year end this portfolio s primary component consists of installment loans 
net consumer loans for household  family and other personal expenditures totaled million at year end  a decrease of million from million at year end 
much of the decrease was the result of our reclassification during the loan review 
consumer lifestyle changes have resulted in increasing emphasis on fast and easy one step loans which has created intense competition for consumer borrowing dollars 
this change  combined with the automotive industry s various rebate programs with low rates at the dealer location  continues a trend that started in of decreasing consumer loans both in absolute amount and percentage of the total loan portfolio 
commercial and agricultural loans are designed specifically to meet the needs of small and medium size business customers 
this category of loans increased million  or to million at december  compared to million at december  however  due to the continued growth of real estate loans  it comprises only of the total portfolio at year end compared to at year end and at year end the growth in real estate construction and commercial  industrial and agricultural loans emphasize our clear commitment to support small to medium sized businesses 
consistent with our focus on providing community based financial services  we generally do not make loans outside of our principal market region 
we do not engage in foreign lending activities  consequently the loan portfolio is not exposed to the sometimes volatile risk from foreign credits 
we further maintain a policy not to originate or purchase loans classified by regulators as highly leveraged transactions or loans to foreign entities or individuals 
our unfunded loan commitments  excluding credit card lines and letters of credit  at year end totaled million  compared to million at year end unfunded loan commitments excluding million in home equity lines are used in large part to meet seasonal funding needs which are generally higher from spring through fall than at year end 
historically  our loan collateral has been primarily real estate because of the nature of our market region 
however  as we expand into newer markets  to us  we are encountering other collateral options which in lieu of real estate  are booked based on strong credit guidelines and controls to monitor the status of the collateral 
asset quality our allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the amount needed to provide for inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
in determining adequacy of the allowance  we consider our historical loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  specific impaired loans  the overall level of nonaccrual loans  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  experience and depth of lending staff  effects of credit concentrations and economic conditions 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
because the risk of loan loss includes general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses can only be an estimate 
our ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate owned at year end increased to compared to at december  and up 
table of contents from at december  the rapid increase in this measure points out the sudden decline in the lending environment as the economy deteriorates and unemployment measures worsen 
as a result  nonperforming assets rose million  or to million at year end  compared to million at year end net charge offs for increased million or to million  compared to thousand for the year we have a loan review committee consisting of bank officers and board members 
additionally an independent credit review firm performs a review of loans  including a sfas no 
review for determining specific reserves 
we utilize a risk based evaluation system based on loan type  collateral and payment history to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on this loan review process and analysis 
in the current lending environment with the economic markets stressed and our borrowers struggling  management took aggressive action raising the provision for loan loss to just over million and expects to continue building the reserve in as the risk assessments dictate 
in  at year end  evb had a ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding of compared to at year end and to at december   respectively 
for the same dates  the loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans ratio was  and  indicating that the allowance was adequate with respect to nonaccrual loans 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is subject to regulatory examinations which may review such factors as the method used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer companies identified by regulatory agencies 
we will continue to increase our loan loss reserve in if the portfolio risks dictate 
we will work with each customer through these tough economic times wherever it is feasible 
in addition  we will review all the new initiatives that the us government implements that may offer relief to our borrowers

the total amount of non real estate secured nonaccrual loans was thousand 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status at the time when the collection of principal and interest are considered to be doubtful 
the accrual of interest on loans  except credit cards  consumer loans and residential mortgage loans  is automatically discontinued at the time the loan is days delinquent 
credit card loans and other personal loans are typically charged off before reaching days past due 
in all cases  loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful 
no interest is accrued on loans placed in a nonaccrual status  and any unpaid interest previously accrued on such loans is reversed when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status 
if interest on nonaccrual loans had been accrued  such income would have approximated thousand and thousand for the years and  respectively 
the balance of the nonperforming assets at year end is the other real estate oreo owned in the amount of thousand compared to million in oreo consists of two properties  one for thousand and the other for thousand 
the thousand oreo property was sold at a small gain subsequent to year end the following table shows nonperforming assets at the dates indicated

these are major increases which have been brought on by the economic down turn 
the year will probably be similar as the economic forecasts do not show a turn around until the end of the year or possibly in as stated earlier  reserves will continue to be increased as needed 
while loans are charged off  there is some potential to recover portions in the future 

table of contents at december   we reported million in impaired loans  an increase of million from million at december  of this million in impaired loans  million was included in nonperforming loans 
the average balance of impaired loans for the twelve months ended december  was million 
loans are viewed as impaired based upon individual evaluations of discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
these loans are subject to constant management attention  and their status is reviewed on a regular basis

deposits we have historically focused on increasing core deposits to reduce the need for other borrowings to fund growth in earning assets 
core deposits provide a low cost and stable source of funding for our asset growth 
interest rates paid on deposits are carefully managed to provide an attractive market rate while at the same time not adversely affecting the net interest margin 
borrowing through the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb is utilized for funding when the cost of borrowed funds falls below the cost of new interest bearing deposits 
we also utilize purchased deposits from a couple of sources when the rates are below our market rates 
at year end  our total deposit balance was million an increase of million from million at year end this growth included million acquired in our branch purchase  while the remainder is from market growth and an increase in brokered deposits 
our loan growth in continued at a rapid rate that drove a demand for funding which our normal markets could not handle that quickly since rates were dropping throughout the year 
management decided to increase the level of brokered deposits on a short term basis 
at year end  there were million in brokered deposits 
this included about million that mature in early january but were prefunded in december 
noninterest bearing deposits decreased by million or to million at year end compared to million at december  a more representative review of the year long funding picture is the average deposits for the year  which reflect how much we are really funding over the year 
for  average total deposits of million represented a increase over the average of million 
average deposits for grew in all categories except demand and savings deposits 
noninterest bearing average deposits declined million to million for  a decline that has been going on since a high in savings decreased million  or  compared to when this same category declined 
in looking at these two categories  it is important to note that the trend in our lowest cost deposit categories is down which forces the bank to pay more for deposits 
money market accounts grew to million while the rate was down basis point 
in  large dollar and regular certificates of deposit increased million  or  and million  or  respectively  continuing a trend seen since interest bearing checking accounts now increased million  or  in compared to an increase of million in this increase is attributed to our reward checking product  whose balances have continually grown since its introduction in late this product pays an above market interest rate if customers achieve some basic requirements that encourage the customer to utilize electronic transactions which are less costly to the bank 
now accounts  at an average balance of million are our second largest deposit category after consumer certificates of deposit and total million 
the actual annual yield on now account has risen from in to in while this is a high rate for what used to be considered cheap money  it is well below and for large and consumer certificates  respectively 
attracting deposits to our bank has been a 
table of contents challenge over the last three years 
the high interest rate environment in the market three years ago  then the rapid decline in rates in  coupled with the plummeting economy have made customers and potential customers fearful of what will happen to their money 
management s challenge in is to manage the net interest margin in a recessionary economy by anticipating  reacting to and adjusting to each new change in the markets 
total deposits at year end of million were an increase of million  or  compared to million at year end 
the deposit growth in was the result of increases in certificates of deposit and now deposits 
all other deposit categories declined in average deposits for were million  an increase of  or million  compared to average deposits of million

capital represents original investment by shareholders plus retained earnings and provides financial resources over which we can exercise greater control as compared to deposits and borrowed funds 
regulatory authorities have adopted guidelines to establish minimum capital standards 
specifically  the guidelines classify assets and balance sheet items into four risk weighted categories 
the minimum regulatory total capital to risk weighted assets is  of which at least must be tier capital  defined as common equity and retained earnings  plus trust preferred debt up to of tier capital  less goodwill and intangibles 
at december   we had a total risk based capital ratio of and a tier leverage ratio of  both in excess of regulatory guidelines and the amount needed to support our banking business 

table of contents capital is carefully managed as the financial opportunities of a high capital base are weighed against the impact of the return on equity ratio 
in january  we announced a stock repurchase program intended to reduce high capital levels and to increase return on equity to shareholders 
this plan was amended in and the number of shares that can be repurchased is of the outstanding shares on january of each year 
we repurchased  shares in   shares in and no shares in details of the number of shares available and purchases by month can be seen in our q filings with the sec 
theere were no shares repurchased in the third and fourth quarters of in december  we completed an offering of our common stock 
we sold million shares and received over million net proceeds in new capital 
these funds gave us flexibility in which allowed us to fund assets purchases early in with out borrowing and gave us flexibility in a tight deposit milieu 
subsequent to year end  the january  issuance of preferred stock to the u 
s 
treasury added million to capital 
the preferred stock will pay cumulative dividends at a fixed rate of per annum for the first five years  and thereafter  at a rate of per annum 
there are no material commitments at this time but management estimates that all our capital ratios will increase by about

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had million of off balance sheet credit exposure in the form of million of commitments to grant loans and unfunded commitments under lines of credit and million of standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
the commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the amount of collateral obtained  if it is deemed necessary by us  is based on our credit evaluation of the customer 
unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit  revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers 
these lines of credit are usually uncollateralized and do not always contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which we are committed 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending a loan to our customers 
we generally hold collateral supporting those commitments if deemed necessary 
liquidity liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
liquid assets include cash  deposits with other banks  federal funds sold  investments and loans maturing or repricing within one year 
our management of liquid assets provides a liquidity level that we believe is sufficient to satisfy our depositors requirements and to meet our customers credit needs 
at december   million or of total earning assets were due to mature or reprice within the next year 
we also maintain additional sources of liquidity through a variety of borrowing arrangements 
federal funds borrowing arrangements with major regional banks combined with immediately available lines of credit with the federal home loan bank totaled million at december  at year end  we had million of fhlb borrowings outstanding 
during  we executed new borrowings of million and had paydowns of million in fhlb borrowings 
the following table presents our contractual obligations and scheduled payment amounts due at various intervals over the next five years and beyond 
as of payments due by period total less than year years years over years dollars in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total 
table of contents inflation in financial institutions  unlike most manufacturing companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a bank s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rate movement is not necessarily tied to movements in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates 
accounting rule changes refer to note of the audited financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
our market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
we are responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of evb and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
the board of directors reviews guidelines established by management 
it is our policy not to engage in activities considered to be derivative in nature such as futures  option contracts  swaps  caps  floors  collars or forward commitments 
we consider derivatives as speculative which is contrary to our historical or prospective philosophy 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
we do hold in our loan and securities portfolios investments that adjust or float according to changes in index rates which is not considered speculative  but necessary for good asset liability management 
asset liability risk management the primary goals of asset liability risk management are to maximize net interest income and the net value of our future cash flows within the interest rate limits set by our asset liability committee alco 
interest rate risk measurement interest rate risk is monitored through the use of three complementary measures static gap analysis  earnings simulation modeling and net present value estimation 
while each of the interest rate risk measurements has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of our interest rate risk  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
static gap gap analysis measures the amount of repricing risk embedded in the balance sheet at a point in time 
it does so by comparing the differences in the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
a gap is defined as the difference between the principal amount of assets and liabilities  adjusted for off balance sheet instruments  which reprice within a specific time period 
the cumulative one year gap at year end was a negative which is within the policy limit for the one year gap of plus to minus of total earning assets at a combined company level 
core deposits and loans with noncontractual maturities are included in the gap repricing distributions based upon historical patterns determined by statistical analysis  based upon industry accepted assumptions including the most recent core deposit defaults set forth by the ffiec federal financial institutions examination council 
the gap repricing distributions include principal cash flows from residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in the time frames in which they are expected to be received 
mortgage prepayments are estimated by applying industry median projections of prepayment speeds to portfolio segments based on coupon range and loan age 
earnings simulation the earnings simulation model forecasts one year net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in interest rate relationships 
management evaluates the effects on income of alternative interest rate scenarios against earnings in a stable interest rate environment 
this type of analysis is also most useful in determining the short run earnings exposures to changes in customer behavior involving loan payments and deposit additions and withdrawals 

table of contents the most recent earnings simulation model projects net income would decrease approximately of stable rate or base net income if rates were to fall immediately by basis points 
it projects a decrease of approximately if rates rise by basis points 
management believes this reflects an asset sensitive interest risk for the one year horizon although an alternative calculation indicates an asset sensitive position in a day horizon and a slightly liability sensitive position in a one year horizon 
this dynamic simulation model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time  in different interest rate environments 
loan and deposit growth rate assumptions are derived from historical analysis and management s outlook  as are the assumptions used to project yields and rates for new loans and deposits 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry median estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
noncontractual deposit growth rates and pricing are assumed to follow historical patterns 
the sensitivities of key assumptions are analyzed at least annually and reviewed by management 
net present value the net present value npv of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows 
interest rate risk analysis using npv involves changing the interest rates used in determining the cash flows and in discounting the cash flows 
the resulting percentage change in npv is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
at year end  a basis point immediate increase in rates is estimated to decrease npv by 
additionally  npv is estimated to decrease by if rates fall immediately by basis points 
analysis of the average quarterly change in the treasury yield curve over the past ten years indicates that a parallel curve shift of basis points or more is an event that has less than a chance of occurrence 
as with gap analysis and earnings simulation modeling  assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in npv analysis 
particularly important are the assumptions driving mortgage prepayments and the assumptions about expected attrition of the core deposit portfolios 
these assumptions are applied consistently across the different rate risk measures
