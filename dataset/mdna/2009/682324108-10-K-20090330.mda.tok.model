item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those identified below  and those discussed in the section titled risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
all dollar amounts included in this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations represent us dollars unless otherwise specified 
throughout this discussion  unless the context specifies or implies otherwise  the terms company  oncothyreon  biomira  we  us and our refer to oncothyreon inc  its predecessor  biomira inc  and its subsidiaries 
overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development of therapeutic products for the treatment of cancer 
our goal is to develop and commercialize novel synthetic vaccines and targeted small molecules that have the potential to improve the lives and outcomes of cancer patients 
our cancer vaccines are designed to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells  while our small molecule compounds are designed to inhibit the activity of specific cancer related proteins 
we are advancing our product candidates through in house development efforts and strategic collaborations 
we believe the quality and breadth of our product candidate pipeline  strategic collaborations and scientific team will enable us to become an integrated biopharmaceutical company with a diversified portfolio of novel  commercialized therapeutics for major diseases 
our lead product candidate is stimuvax  which is a cancer vaccine currently in phase development for non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 
we have granted an exclusive  worldwide license to merck kgaa of darmstadt  germany  or merck kgaa  for the development  manufacture and commercialization of stimuvax 
our pipeline of clinical and pre clinical stage proprietary small molecule product candidates was acquired by us in october from prolx pharmaceuticals corporation  or prolx 
we are currently focusing our internal development efforts on 
table of contents px  for which we initiated a phase trial in advanced metastatic cancer in august  and px  for which we initiated a phase trial in advanced metastatic cancer in june we are completing a phase trial for px in pancreatic cancer and have announced our intention to seek a partner for further development 
as of the date of this report  we have not licensed any rights to our small molecules to any third party and retain all development  commercialization and manufacturing rights 
in addition to our product candidates  we have developed novel vaccine technology we may develop ourselves and or license to others 
in  we entered into exclusive supply and collaboration agreements with merck kgaa to develop and market stimuvax  subject to certain development and co promotion rights we retained 
in connection with entering into these agreements  merck kgaa made an equity investment in us in  was obligated to make additional cash payments  generally contingent on satisfaction of specified milestones  and to pay us a royalty on stimuvax sales  if any 
in august  we restructured our agreements with merck kgaa such that merck kgaa would fully assume responsibility for the further clinical development and marketing of stimuvax 
under the restated agreements  we converted the us and canadian co promotion interest to a specified royalty rate  which is higher than the rate merck kgaa had agreed to pay in markets outside of north america under the original agreements 
the restated agreements also contained development and sales based milestone payments as well as revised payments related to manufacturing scale up and process transfer 
under the revised agreements  we retained the right to manufacture of stimuvax  including process development and scale up for commercial manufacturing 
the signing of the amended agreements also triggered a milestone payment to us of million  before associated payments to third parties of million  which was received in september in december  we announced that we had completed the transfer of certain assays and methodology related to stimuvax to merck kgaa triggering a payment to us of million 
in may we completed the transfer of certain additional assays and manufacturing technology related to stimuvax which triggered a payment to us of million 
under the august agreement merck kgaa would exclusively purchase stimuvax from us  with respect to purchases for commercial sales  the purchase price would be subtracted from our royalty 
on december   we entered into a new license agreement with merck kgaa pursuant to which the amended and restated collaboration and supply agreements were replaced 
under the new license agreement  among other things  we licensed to merck kgaa the right to manufacture stimuvax and transferred certain manufacturing know how to merck kgaa in return for an upfront payment of approximately million and the royalty rates on net sales to which we are entitled if stimuvax is commercialized were reduced by a specified amount which we believe is consistent with our estimate of costs of goods  manufacturing scale up costs and certain other expenses assumed by merck kgaa 
all other milestone payments remained the same and we expect to receive a milestone payment in related to process development 
in connection with this transaction  oncothyreon also entered into an asset purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold to merck kgaa certain assets related to the manufacture of  and inventory of  stimuvax  placebo and raw materials  and merck kgaa agreed to assume certain liabilities related to the manufacture of stimuvax and our obligations related to the lease of our edmonton  alberta  canada facility 
the aggregate purchase price paid by the buyers pursuant to the terms asset purchase agreement consisted of approximately million  for aggregate consideration payable to us in connection with the new license agreement and the asset purchase agreement of approximately million 
in addition  employees at our former edmonton facility were transferred to merck  which will significantly reduce our operating expenses in future periods 
we have not developed a therapeutic product to the commercial stage 
as a result  our revenue has been limited to date  and we do not expect to recognize any material revenue for the foreseeable future 
in particular  our ability to generate revenue in future periods will depend substantially on the progress of ongoing clinical trials for stimuvax and our small molecule compounds  our ability to obtain development and commercialization partners for our small molecule compounds  merck kgaa s success in obtaining regulatory approval for stimuvax  our success in obtaining regulatory approval for our small molecule compounds  and merck kgaa s and our respective abilities to establish commercial markets for these drugs 

table of contents any adverse clinical results relating to stimuvax or any decision by merck kgaa to discontinue its efforts to develop and commercialize the product would have a material and adverse effect on our future revenues and results of operations and would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
our small molecule compounds are much earlier in the development stage than stimuvax  and we do not expect to realize any revenues associated with the commercialization of our products candidates for the foreseeable future 
the continued research and development of our product candidates will require significant additional expenditures  including preclinical studies  clinical trials  manufacturing costs and the expenses of seeking regulatory approval 
we rely on third parties to conduct a portion of our preclinical studies  all of our clinical trials and all of the manufacturing of cgmp material 
we expect expenditures associated with these activities to increase in future years as we continue the development of our small molecule product candidates 
we have incurred substantial losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit totaled million 
we recognized net income of million for compared to a net loss of million for the december transaction with merck kgaa resulted in the recognition of million which had previously been recorded as deferred revenue  million related to the bulk sale of inventory and million from the sale of stimuvax manufacturing rights and know how 
in future periods  we expect to continue to incur substantial net losses as we expand our research and development activities with respect to our small molecules product candidates 
to date we have funded our operations principally through the sale of our equity securities  cash received through our strategic alliance with merck kgaa  government grants  debt financings  and equipment financings 
we completed our most recent financing in december  raising approximately million in gross proceeds from the sale of our common stock and the issuance of warrants 
because we have limited revenues and substantial research and development and operating expenses  we expect that we will in the future seek additional working capital funding from the sale of equity or debt securities or the licensing of rights to our product candidates 
on august   we disclosed we received a letter from the nasdaq stock market indicating that we did not comply with the requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq global market because the market value of our common stock was not at least million 
we appealed this decision and after demonstrating  among other things  that we met an alternative listing requirement since our stockholders equity was greater than million as of december   the nasdaq listing qualifications panel determined that we had regained compliance with the nasdaq global market listing requirements and so notified on march  our predecessor corporation  biomira inc  a canadian corporation  or biomira  listed its common shares on the toronto stock exchange in july in connection with its initial public offering 
in december  biomira listed its securities for trading on the nasdaq global market 
until december   biomira s shares traded on the nasdaq global market under the symbol biom in us dollars and on the toronto stock exchange under the symbol bra in canadian dollars 
on december   we became the successor corporation to biomira by way of a plan of arrangement effected pursuant to canadian law 
on december   we announced that our common stock began trading on the nasdaq global market under the symbol onty in us dollars and on the toronto stock exchange under the symbol ony in canadian dollars at the opening of trading on december  in addition  pursuant to the plan of arrangement  shareholders of the former biomira received one share of our common stock for each six common shares of biomira that they held 
for years presented prior to  this management s discussion and analysis and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended december  have been prepared after giving effect to the for reverse share exchange implemented in connection with the plan of arrangement 
the financial statements and management s discussion and analysis have been prepared using us dollars as the reporting currency 
key financial metrics revenue historically  our revenue has been derived from our contract research and development activities  payments under our collaborative agreements  and miscellaneous licensing  royalty and other revenues from ancillary 
table of contents business and operating activities 
our collaboration with merck kgaa on the development of stimuvax has contributed the substantial majority of our revenue 
prior to august  revenue from our lead product candidate  stimuvax  was reported under contract research and development revenue 
from august  when we entered into the amended and restated supply agreement with merck kgaa to december   when we entered into the new license agreement with merck kgaa  we retained the right to manufacture stimuvax and merck kgaa was obligated to purchase stimuvax exclusively from us 
as a result  revenue generated during that period was reported as contract manufacturing revenue 
as a result of the entry into the december agreements with merck kgaa  we will no longer generate revenues from the manufacture of stimuvax in future periods 
contract research and development 
contract research and development revenue represents merck kgaa s contribution toward shared costs associated with stimuvax clinical trials and clinical trial material provided to merck kgaa related to stimuvax 
effective march   we transitioned responsibility for all stimuvax clinical development and regulatory activities to and the related costs thereon to merck kgaa 
in january  merck kgaa initiated a global phase clinical trial under our collaboration assessing the efficacy and safety of stimuvax as a potential treatment for inoperable non small cell lung cancer 
we expect the clinical trial to include approximately  patients in approximately countries 
because of the change in our responsibilities for stimuvax clinical trials  our contract research and development revenue was reduced as we no longer receive reimbursements for shared clinical trial costs 
contract manufacturing 
from august  when we entered into the amended and restated supply agreement with merck kgaa to december   when we entered into the new license agreement with merck kgaa  we retained the right to manufacture stimuvax and merck kgaa was obligated to purchase stimuvax exclusively from us 
as a result  our financial reporting during that period reflects the revenue related to the supply of stimuvax separately as contract manufacturing revenue 
as a result of the entry into the new license agreement in december  we will not realize revenue from the manufacture of stimuvax in future periods licensing revenue from collaborative agreements 
for periods presented until december  when we entered into the new license agreement with merck kgaa licensing revenue consisted of upfront payments received and other payments made upon achievement of certain development milestones relating to transfers of know how  clinical trials  regulatory approvals  and commercial development of stimuvax under our agreements with merck kgaa 
such revenue is amortized over the life of the relevant patents that had been subject to the former collaboration agreement 
as result of the entry into the new license agreement  the future performance obligations that required the payments to be amortized have been eliminated 
therefore  all existing deferred revenue relating to stimuvax has been recognized in income as we have no more continuing involvement in the development efforts of stimuvax 
future milestones payments will be recognized in income as they are received 
licensing  royalties  and other revenue 
licensing  royalties  and other revenue include revenue from sales of compounds and processes from patented technologies to third parties 
we did not generate any revenue from the sale of such compounds or processes during the year ended december  expenses research and development manufacturing 
research and development manufacturing expense consists of costs associated with research activities as well as costs associated with our product development efforts  conducting preclinical studies  and clinical trial and manufacturing costs 
these expenses include external research and development expenses incurred pursuant to agreements with third party manufacturing organizations  technology access and licensing fees related to the use of proprietary third party technologies  employee and consultant related expenses  including salaries  stock based compensation expense  benefits  and related costs  and third party supplier expenses 
for the periods covered by this report  we have recognized research and development expenses  including those paid to third parties  as they have been incurred 
we credit funding received from government research and development grants against research and development expense 
these credits totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these grants were small business innovation research  or sbir  grants that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of prolx on 
table of contents october  we have successfully applied for and received approval for an additional million grant for the period august  to july  the majority of our research and development programs are at an early stage and may not result in any approved products 
product candidates that appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a variety of reasons 
for example  merck kgaa cancelled our collaboration relating to theratope only after receiving phase clinical trial results 
we had made substantial investments over several years in the development of theratope and terminated all development activities following the cancellation of our collaboration 
similarly  any of our continuing product candidates may be found to be ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to complete clinical trials than we have anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality 
as part of our business strategy  we may enter into collaboration agreements with larger third party pharmaceutical companies to complete the development and commercialization of our small molecule or other product candidates  and it is unknown whether or on what terms we will be able to secure collaboration arrangements for any candidate 
for example  we intend to seek to a collaboration partner for px in addition  it is difficult to provide the impact of collaboration arrangements  if any  on the development of product candidates 
establishing collaborative product development relationships with large pharmaceutical companies may or may not accelerate the time to completion or reduce our costs with respect to the development and commercialization of any product candidate 
as a result of these uncertainties and the other risks inherent in the drug development process  we cannot determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of any of our product candidates 
similarly  we cannot determine when  if  or to what extent we may generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any product candidate 
the timeframe for development of any product candidate  associated development costs  and the probability of regulatory and commercial success vary widely 
as a result  other than with respect to stimuvax  which is subject to our obligations under the agreements with merck kgaa  we continually evaluate our product candidates and make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to specific candidates 
these determinations are typically made based on consideration of numerous factors  including our evaluation of scientific and clinical trial data and an ongoing assessment of the product candidate s commercial prospects 
we anticipate that we will continue to develop our portfolio of product candidates  which will increase our research and development expense in future periods 
we do not expect any of our current candidates to be commercially available before  if at all 
prior to august  costs associated with manufacturing stimuvax were aggregated with other research and development expenses and reported as one line item 
from august  when we entered into the amended and restated supply agreement with merck kgaa to december   when we entered into the new license agreement with merck kgaa  we reported costs associated with manufacturing stimuvax as manufacturing expense 
as a result of the entry into the new license agreement with merck kgaa in december  we will not incur manufacturing expenses associated with this activity  general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists principally of salaries  benefits  stock based compensation expense  and related costs for personnel in our executive  finance  accounting  information technology  and human resource functions 
other general and administrative expenses include an allocation of our facility costs and professional fees for legal  consulting  and accounting services 
marketing and business development 
marketing and business development expense consists principally of salaries  benefits  stock based compensation expense  and related costs for marketing and business development personnel  including travel costs  research subscriptions  and other marketing administrative costs 
depreciation 
depreciation expense consists of depreciation of the cost of plant and equipment such as scientific  office  manufacturing  and computer equipment as well as depreciation of leasehold improvements 
in process research and development 
in process research and development expense relates to the portfolio of oncology products we acquired in connection with the acquisition of prolx 
these technologies require regulatory approval to be commercialized and  in the absence of such regulatory approval  have no proven alternative future use 
consequently  we expensed their fair value at the time of the acquisition 
during the year 
table of contents ended december   we recognized in process research and development expenses of million in connection with the prolx acquisition 
investment and other income 
investment and other income consists of interest and other income on our cash and short term investments and foreign exchange gains and losses 
our short term investments consist of canadian or us federal  state  or provincial debt securities  investment grade corporate debt securities and commercial paper  and term deposits or similar instruments of trust companies and banks  all with original maturities of between days and one year at the time of purchase 
historically  our short term investments and cash balances were denominated in either us dollars or canadian dollars  and the relative weighting between us dollars and canadian dollars varied based on market conditions and our operating requirements in the two countries 
however  with the reincorporation to  and concentration of our operating activities in  the united states  from october   our cash balances have been maintained predominantly in us dollar deposits 
we have historically not engaged in hedging transactions with respect to our us and canadian dollars investment assets or cash balances 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest payments under capital lease agreements for computer equipment 
change in fair value of warrants 
change in fair value of warrants relates to outstanding warrants to acquire shares of common stock 
the exercise price of the warrants is denominated in us dollars 
share purchase warrants with an exercise price denominated in a currency other than our functional currency  which  prior to january   was the canadian dollar  are recorded as liabilities 
changes in the fair value of the warrants are then reflected in our statement of operations 
income tax recovery 
income tax recovery relates to the proceeds realized from the sale of new jersey state tax losses attributable to our us subsidiary operating in the state of new jersey 
with the closing in december of our new jersey operations  we will no longer be eligible to sell our tax losses 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates we have prepared this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations based on our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been included in this report beginning on page f and which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of our consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon historical experience and information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
the securities and exchange commission considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations and if it requires the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and because they require critical management judgment and estimates about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  good will impairment  stock based compensation  and foreign currency translation 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair values when there is reliable evidence of fair value for all elements of the arrangement  otherwise  consideration is allocated based on the residual value method 
the applicable revenue recognition criteria are then applied to each of the separate units 
payments received in advance of work performed are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when earned 
revenue from our collaboration with merck kgaa on the development of stimuvax is recognized as follows up front fees and license fees 
prior to december  when we entered into the new license agreement with merck kgaa  up front fees and license fees from merck kgaa under the former collaboration agreement were deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement or related patent life 
securities and exchange commission  or sec  staff accounting bulletin topic a f  nonrefundable up front fees  provides guidance on the accounting for nonrefundable up front fees  including license fees that are payable at the initiation of a licensing agreement 
generally  nonrefundable fees are not recognized immediately as revenue unless the fee is consideration for a separate deliverable that represents the culmination of a separate earnings process 
the bulletin requires future obligations or performance requirements on the part of the seller be analyzed to determine whether the undelivered or unperformed obligations are inconsequential or perfunctory 
under the terms of the new license agreement entered into with merck kgaa in december  we have no future performance obligations and therefore  we have recognized all previously deferred revenue 
milestones 
milestone payments under our agreements with merck kgaa are recognized as revenue upon performance of obligations or satisfaction of conditions defined as milestones in the agreements  assuming we have no further involvement or obligation to perform with respect to the milestone under our agreements with merck kgaa 
milestone payments for which we have ongoing involvement or obligations are deferred and recognized as revenue over the estimated period of our ongoing involvement or performance of our obligation 
contract research funding and contract manufacturing 
prior to march   we were responsible for clinical research and development costs related to obtaining regulatory approval in north america  while merck kgaa and we agreed to equal co funding of eligible clinical research and development costs related to obtaining regulatory approval for rest of world 
we recognized these reimbursed costs as revenue in the same period the costs were incurred 
effective march   we transitioned responsibility for the clinical research and development and regulatory activities for stimuvax to merck kgaa 
subsequent to march   we have continued to receive cost reimbursements from merck kgaa related to transition activities and the supply of clinical trial material 
the reimbursed transition costs were recognized as revenue in the same period the costs are incurred 
clinical trial material revenue was reported as contract manufacturing revenue after the earlier of the expiration of a day return period or formal acceptance of the clinical trial material by merck kgaa 
in august  we signed amended and restated collaboration and supply agreements related to stimuvax with merck kgaa 
under the terms of the amended agreements  we retained the responsibility for the manufacture stimuvax and merck kgaa had agreed to purchase stimuvax from us 
the collaboration and supply agreements transformed what were previously reimbursements of a portion of the stimuvax manufacturing costs to a long term contract manufacturing arrangement 
our financial reporting from the date the collaboration and supply agreements were executed reflects the revenue and associated clinical trial material costs related to the supply of stimuvax separately in the consolidated statements of operations as contract manufacturing revenue and manufacturing expense  respectively 
previously  these amounts were reported under contract research and development revenue and research and development expense  respectively 
contract manufacturing revenue was recognized after shipment of the clinical trial material to merck kgaa and upon the earlier of the expiration of a day return period or formal acceptance of the clinical trial material by merck kgaa 
the associated costs of the clinical trial material is removed from inventory and recorded as manufacturing expense at the same time the contract manufacturing revenue is recognized 

table of contents in connection with the execution of the new license agreement in december  we sold our existing material  work in process and finished goods inventory to merck kgaa 
as a result of the entry into the license agreement  we will not realize revenue from the manufacture of stimuvax in future periods 
royalties 
royalties based on reported sales of licensed products  if any  will be recognized based on the terms of our license agreement with merck kgaa when and if reported sales are reliably measurable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
to date  we have not recognized any royalty revenues from product sales under the license agreement 
goodwill impairment goodwill is carried at cost and is not amortized  but is reviewed annually for impairment in the fourth quarter  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
in the event that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized 
there were no impairment charges recorded for any of the periods presented 
stock based compensation we maintain a share option plan under which an aggregate of  shares of common stock underlay outstanding options as of december  and an aggregate of  shares of common stock were available for future issuance 
we have generally granted options to our employees and directors under the share option plan  and we have granted restricted stock to non employee directors under the restricted share unit plan 
prior to april  amendment to our share option plan  we granted options with an exercise price denominated in canadian dollars equal to the closing price of our shares on the toronto stock exchange on the trading day immediately prior to the date of grant 
in cases where our board of directors approved grants during a closed trading window under our insider trading policy  however  our board of directors fixed the exercise price based on the closing price of our common shares on toronto stock exchange trading on the first trading day after our trading window opened 
on and after april   we granted options with an exercise price denominated in us dollars equal to the close price of our shares on the nasdaq global market on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method  which requires us to apply the provisions of sfas r only to awards granted  modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the adoption date 
upon adoption of sfas r  we selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions to determine the fair value of stock based awards  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
we recognize the value of the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest as expense over the requisite vesting periods on a straight line basis in our consolidated statements of operations 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the following table summarizes the weighted average assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock options granted year ended year ended december  december  risk free interest rate expected life of options in years expected dividend rate expected volatility weighted average grant date fair value per share option cdn weighted average grant date fair value per share option usd historically we have based the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option on the yield available on government of canada benchmark bonds with an equivalent expected term 
in future periods we will use the yield at the time of grant of a us treasury security 
the expected life of options in years represents the period of 
table of contents time stock based awards are expected to be outstanding  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards  vesting schedules and historical employee behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock for a period equal to the stock option s expected life 
foreign currency translation for the fiscal year ended december   and comparative periods presented  our functional currency was the canadian dollar 
as such  revenue and expense transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currency are translated into canadian dollars at the average exchange rates in effect at the time of such transactions 
monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current rates at the balance sheet date 
gains or losses resulting from these translation adjustments are included in other income or expense 
the operations of our wholly owned us subsidiaries are considered to be integrated foreign operations as they rely upon funding from us  and accordingly their functional currencies is also the canadian dollar 
their respective books and records are converted to canadian dollars by translating monetary assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date  non monetary assets and liabilities at the rate in effect when the assets were acquired or liabilities were assumed  and items included in the statements of operations at the average exchange rates in effect at the date of such transactions with resulting exchange gains or losses included in the determination of income 
as our reporting currency is the us dollar  our canadian dollar consolidated financial statements are translated into us dollars 
assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date while operations and cash flows are translated at average rates for the period 
translation gains or losses related to our net assets are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the statement of stockholders equity 
effective january   we changed our functional currency to the us dollar from the canadian dollar to reflect our incorporation as a delaware corporation and increasing us dollar denominated revenues and expenditures 
comparative financial statements are not restated and the changes have been accounted for prospectively in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
results of operations for the years ended december   and the following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated 
overview years ended december  change change in millions  except per share amounts revenue n m expenses in process research and development n m n m change in fair value of warrant liability n m income tax recovery n m n m net income loss n m earnings loss per share basic n m earnings loss per share diluted n m not meaningful we had net income of million in as a result of the entry into the license and asset purchase agreements with merck 
this also resulted in the recognition of million in deferred revenue related to sales 
table of contents under the supply agreement superseded by the new license agreement and million from the license of the manufacturing rights to stimuvax and know how 
pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  we recognized million in revenue along with the associated cost of sales of million 
while we experienced net income in  we experienced net losses in each of  and and we expect to continue experiencing net losses as we continue develop our product candidates 
the million decrease in our net loss from to  was attributable in part to the fact that in  we incurred million in in process research and development expense related to the acquisition of prolx in october  and incurred no in process research and development expense in in addition  a reduction in the change in the fair value of warrant liability of million contributed to the smaller net loss in the balance of our expenses  consisting of research and development  manufacturing  general and administrative  marketing and business development  depreciation  investment and other income  and interest expense have increased by million for  compared to  primarily due to million in legal  accounting and tax advisory fees associated with our reincorporation into the united states and certain costs associated with a reduction of administrative staff 
for and  a substantial portion of our operating expenses are denominated in canadian dollars  which was our functional currency in and  and increases in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar had an adverse effect on our expenses when expressed in us dollars on our consolidated statements of operations 
effective january   the us dollar became both our functional and reporting currency  and we continued to incur expenses in canadian dollars associated with our canadian operations however  with the sale of our canadian operations in december we will not continue to be subject to significant foreign currency exchange risks 
revenue years ended december  change change in millions contract research and development n m contract manufacturing n m n m licensing revenues from collaborative agreements n m licensing  royalties and other revenue n m not meaningful prior to august  when we entered into an amended and restated supply agreement with merck kgaa  revenue related to the supply of stimuvax was reported as part of contract research and development revenue 
as a result of our entry into such agreement  revenue related to the supply of stimuvax was reported separately as contract manufacturing revenue and we ceased to generate revenue from contract research and development 
the  or  decrease in contract research and development revenue in relative to was primarily attributable to decreased funding associated with stimuvax as a result of the restructuring of our agreement with merck kgaa 
during  we transitioned responsibility for the clinical development and regulatory activities for stimuvax to merck kgaa  which resulted in reduced contract research and development revenue compared to of the million increase in contract manufacturing revenue in compared to  was related to the bulk sale of our entire raw material  work in process and finished goods inventory to merck kgaa in december and the remaining million was related to increased sales to merck kgaa during the rest of relative to as a result of such bulk sale and the related license of our stimuvax manufacturing rights to merck kgaa  we do not expect any contract manufacturing revenue for the foreseeable future 

table of contents during  we recognized million in contract manufacturing revenue under the amended and restated supply agreement with merck kgaa  which partially offset the million reduction in contract research and development revenue described above 
previously  these amounts would have been reflected under contract research and development revenue and research and development expense  respectively 
in the first quarter of we resumed manufacturing to support the global phase trial of stimuvax and commenced shipments of clinical trial material to merck kgaa in the second quarter of the million increase in our licensing revenue from collaborative agreements for relative to was directly attributable to the license of our stimuvax manufacturing rights and know how which generated an up front payment of million 
since the new license agreement restructured the existing agreements and relieved us of future performance obligations we recognized previously deferred revenue related to this relationship of million 
in our licensing revenue from collaborative agreements increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  in february  we announced that the first patient had been enrolled in a global phase trial of stimuvax which triggered a cash milestone payment to us from merck kgaa of million before associated payments to third parties of million 
in august  we announced the signing of the amended and restated collaboration and supply agreements related to stimuvax with merck kgaa which triggered an additional cash milestone payment to us from merck kgaa of million before associated payments to third parties of million 
finally  in december  we announced the completion of the transfer of certain assays and methodology related to stimuvax to merck kgaa which triggered a further cash milestone payment to us of million

research and development manufacturing expense years ended december  change change in millions research and development manufacturing n m n m the million  or  increase in our combined research and development manufacturing expense for compared to primarily relates to the bulk sale of our inventory to merck kgaa resulting in the significant increase in cost of sales 
the million decrease in of research and development in compared to is attributable primarily to higher allocation of research and development costs to product inventory as manufacturing activity increased during the year 
in connection with the license the of stimuvax manufacturing rights to merck kgaa and sale of related assets  we experienced a substantial reduction in our workforce 
as a result  we expect that our research and development expense will be considerably lower in than it was in our combined research and development manufacturing expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase primarily relates to clinical and development activities related to our prolx operation  which was acquired october   and increased stimuvax manufacturing activities associated with the amended agreements with merck kgaa relating to stimuvax 
partially offsetting these increased expenses in  relative to  was the elimination of costs incurred in associated with restructuring our workforce and transitioning the responsibility for the clinical development and regulatory activities for stimuvax to merck kgaa

table of contents investment and other loss income years ended december  change change in millions investment and other loss income n m n m not meaningful our investment and other loss income increased from a loss of million for the year ended december  to income of million for the year ended december  the change was primarily attributable to million gain from the sale of our manufacturing related plant and equipment to merck kgaa and the decline in foreign exchange loss in of million on our canadian dollar holdings arising from increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar during the year compared to when we suffered foreign exchange losses of million on us dollar holdings arising from increases in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar in the previous year

pursuant to the terms of the amended agreements  from august to december  with the entry into the new license agreement  we retained the responsibility to manufacture stimuvax and merck kgaa agreed to purchase stimuvax from us 
during their term  the amended agreements transformed what were previously reimbursements of a portion of the stimuvax manufacturing costs to a long term contract manufacturing arrangement 
our financial reporting during the term of the collaboration and supply agreements reflects the revenue and associated clinical trial material costs related to the supply of stimuvax separately in the consolidated statements of operations as contract manufacturing revenue and manufacturing expense  respectively 
previously  these amounts were reported under contract research and development revenue and research and development expense  respectively 
the effect of the asset purchase agreement and new license agreement with merck kgaa  is reflected in the last quarter of liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and working capital as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million and accounts receivable of million 
our cash equivalents and short term investments have historically been invested in money market funds  short term obligations of the us treasury and government of canada  and commercial paper 
our accounts receivable primarily represents tax withholdings in germany as a result of our sale of manufacturing rights to merck kgaa in december which we expect to recover 
our primary source of cash has historically been proceeds from the issuance of equity securities  debt and equipment financings  and payments to us under licensing and collaboration agreements 
these proceeds have been used to fund our losses from operations 
our cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  compared to million as of december   a decrease of million  or 
the net decrease reflects operating expenditures of 
table of contents million in offset by million in cash received under our collaboration and supply agreements  million received from the sale of plant and equipment  and million used in the purchase of plant and equipment 
offsetting the decreases was the favorable effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our cash and cash equivalents of million 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million as december  compared to million as of december   a decrease of million  or 
the net decrease reflects operating expenditures of million in offset by million in cash received under our collaboration and supply agreements  million used in payment of accrued business acquisition and share issuance costs  and million used in the purchase of plant and equipment 
offsetting these decreases was the favorable effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our cash and cash equivalents of million and our short term investments of million 
as of december   our working capital was million compared to million as of december   a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in working capital was primarily attributable to a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents  million decrease in government grant receivable  offset by a decline in accounts payable of million and net decline from the elimination of inventory and deferred revenue of million 
the decrease in deferred revenue and the decrease in inventory is related to the license of stimuvax manufacturing rights to merck kgaa in december we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents  together with milestone payments we currently anticipate receiving from merck kgaa under our license agreement  will be sufficient to finance our operations for at least the next months 
nevertheless  we expect that we will require additional capital from time to time in the future in order to continue the development of products in our pipeline and to expand our product portfolio 
we would expect to seek additional financing from the sale and issuance of equity or debt securities  and we cannot predict that financing will be available when and as we need financing or that  if available  that the financing terms will be commercially reasonable 
if we are unable to raise additional financing when and if we require  it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
to the extent we issue additional equity securities  our existing shareholders could experience substantial dilution 
our certificate of incorporation provides for the mandatory redemption of shares of our class ua preferred stock if the company realizes net profits in any year 
see note share capital redemption of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
for this purpose  net profits 
means the after tax profits determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  where relevant  consistently applied 
the certificate of incorporation does not specify the jurisdiction whose generally accepted accounting principles would apply for the redemption provision 
at the time of the original issuance of the shares  we were a corporation organized under the federal laws of canada  and our principal operations were located in canada 
in addition  the original purchaser and current holder of the class ua preferred stock is a canadian entity 
in connection with our reincorporation in delaware  we disclosed that the rights  preferences and privileges of the shares would remain unchanged except as required by delaware law  and the mandatory redemption provisions were not changed 
in addition  the formula for determining the price at which such shares would be redeemed is expressed in canadian dollars 
therefore  if challenged  we believe that a delaware court would determine that net profits be interpreted in accordance with canadian gaap 
as a result of the december merck kgaa transaction  we recognized on a one time basis all deferred revenue relating to stimuvax  under both us gaap and canadian gaap 
under us gaap this resulted in net income 
however  under canadian gaap we were required to recognize an impairment on intangible assets which resulted in a net loss for and therefore do not intend to redeem any shares of class ua preferred stock in if in the future we recognize net income under canadian gaap  or any successor to such principles  or if the holder of class ua preferred stock were to challenge  and prevail in a dispute involving  the interpretation of the mandatory redemption provision  we may be required to redeem such shares which would have an adverse effect on our cash position 
the maximum aggregate amount that we would be required to pay to redeem such shares is can million 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by our net income 
however  operating cash flows differ from net income as a result of non cash charges or differences in the timing of cash flows and earnings recognition 
significant components of cash provided by operating activities are as follows changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities used million in mainly due to pay downs in accrued professional fees relating to the reincorporation in delaware 
accrued compensation and related costs used million during the year as a result of the decrease in our workforce 
inventories decreased million in  as a result our bulk sale of raw materials and clinical product following the asset purchase agreement with merck kgaa 
receivables and other assets decreased by million 
accounts receivable decreased by million in government grants receivable declined million as the activity related to px was reduced during the year 
during the year we received million and million in milestone payments and advances on product sales 
these payments were deferred and not recognized in income at the time of receipt 
as a result of the transaction with merck kgaa in december  see results of operations  we included in revenue previously deferred revenue of million million for milestone payments and million of advances on product sales 
in we received million and million in milestone payments and advances on product sales 
these payments were deferred and not recognized in income at the time of receipt 
our inventory increased by million in as a result of our agreement to manufacture and supply merck kgaa with clinical product and our accounts payable and accrued expenses increased as result of increased higher activity with our reincorporation in delaware 
cash flows from investing activities we had cash inflows of million from investing activities during the year ended december   an increase of million from the million cash from investing activities in the year ended december  the increase in cash from investing activities compared to was attributable principally to lower net redemptions of short term investments required to fund operations of million and proceeds from the sale of plant and equipment of million 
we had cash inflows of million from investing activities during the year ended december   an increase of million from the million cash used in the year ended december  this change was attributable principally to lower net redemptions of short term investments required to fund operations of million and lower business acquisition costs of million 
cash flows from financing activities we used million of cash in financing activities during the year ended december   a decrease of million over the million cash used in the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in financing activities between fiscal and fiscal was attributable principally to the reduction of cost related to shares and warrant issuance 
we used million of cash in financing activities during the year ended december   a decrease of million over the million cash from financing activities in the year ended december  this change was attributable principally to the january and december common stock and warrant financings which generated proceeds of million 
contractual obligations and contingencies in our continuing operations  we have entered into long term contractual arrangements from time to time for our facilities  debt financing  the provision of goods and services  and acquisition of technology access rights  
table of contents among others 
the following table presents contractual obligations arising from these arrangements as of december  payments due by period less than after total year years years years in thousands operating leases premises in may  we entered into a sublease for an office facility in seattle  washington totaling approximately  square feet where we intend to consolidate certain of our operations 
the sublease expires in december  in may we also entered into a lease directly with the landlord of such facility which will have a six year term beginning at the expiration of the sublease 
the sublease provides for a base rent of  increasing to  the lease provides for a base rent of  increasing to  in in connection with the acquisition of prolx  we assumed two loan agreements under which approximately  was outstanding at december  one loan  in the aggregate principal amount of  requires repayment only in the event that we commercialize the product or service developed with the funds provided under the loan agreement 
for purposes of the loan  a product or service is considered to be commercialized as of the date we receive fda approval for the product or service or upon receipt of consideration for the sale or license of the product or service 
in addition  if we commercialize a product or service developed with funding under the agreement  we are required to conduct manufacturing in the commonwealth of pennsylvania or pay a transfer fee equal to three times the amount of the funding 
a second loan  in the aggregate principal amount of  is repayable on similar terms as the first loan in the event we commercialize a product or service developed with funding received under the second loan 
in addition  under the second loan  if we commercialize a product or service funded under the second loan  we are obligated to maintain a significant presence  defined as of our personnel  in the commonwealth of pennsylvania for a period of ten years or to pay a transfer fee equal to three times the amount of the funding 
finally  if we become obligated to repay the loans as a result of having commercialized a product or service  the aggregate amount repayable will equal the original funded amount multiplied by a factor ranging from one to two  subject to certain conditions 
as the timing of any future payments under these loans cannot be determined with any certainty  the related repayments have not been reflected in the above schedule of contractual obligations 
in connection with the acquisition of prolx  we may become obligated to issue additional shares of our common stock to the former stockholders of prolx upon satisfaction of certain milestones 
we may become obligated to issue shares of our common stock with a fair market value of million determined based on a weighted average trading price at the time of issuance upon the initiation of the first phase clinical trial for a prolx product 
we may become obligated to issue shares of our common stock with a fair market value of million determined based on a weighted average trading price at the time of issuance upon regulatory approval of a prolx product in a major market 
under certain licensing arrangements for technologies incorporated into our product candidates  we are contractually committed to payment of ongoing licensing fees and royalties  as well as contingent payments when certain milestones as defined in the agreements have been achieved 
guarantees and indemnification in the ordinary course of our business  we have entered into agreements with our collaboration partners  vendors  and other persons and entities that include guarantees or indemnity provisions 
for example  our agreements with merck kgaa and the former stockholders of prolx contain certain tax indemnification provisions  and we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors 
based on information known to us as of december   we believe that our exposure related to these guarantees and indemnification obligations is not material

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
fair value measurements  or sfas sfas introduces a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosure about fair value measurements of assets and liabilities 
sfas defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability  an exit price  in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
sfas also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
sfas describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level observable inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  and level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the adoption of sfas did not have any effect on our financial condition or results of operations  however  sfas introduced new disclosures about how we value certain assets and liabilities 
much of the disclosure is focused on the inputs used to measure fair value  particularly in instances where the measurement uses significant unobservable  ie  level  inputs 
all of our financial instruments as of december  are level for financial assets and liabilities  sfas was effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and we have adopted the standard for those assets and liabilities as of january  the impact of adoption was not significant 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas sfas allows entities the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value as of specified dates 
such election  which may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis  is typically irrevocable once elected 
we have not elected to apply sfas to any assets or liabilities  therefore the adoption of sfas did not result in a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

 accounting for non refundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities  or eitf eitf requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities be deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
the adoption of eitf did not result in a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may the fasb released sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  or sfas sfas identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of companies that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
fasb believes that the gaap hierarchy should be determined by management because it is the company  not its auditor that is responsible for selecting accounting principles for financial statements that are presented in conformity with gaap 
accordingly  fasb concluded that the gaap hierarchy should reside in the accounting literature established by the fasb and issued sfas to achieve that result 
sfas becomes effective days following the sec s approval of the public

in september  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 collaborative arrangements  or eitf eitf addresses the accounting for arrangements in which two companies work together to achieve a commercial objective  without forming a separate legal entity 
the nature and purpose of a company s collaborative arrangements are required to be disclosed  along with the accounting policies applied and the classification and amounts for significant financial activities related to the arrangements 
the consensus is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of eitf on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  or sfas r 
sfas r requires most identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at fair value 
the statement applies to all business combinations  including combinations among mutual entities and combinations by contract alone 
under sfas r  all business combinations will be accounted for by applying the acquisition method 
statement r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  earlier application of sfas r is prohibited 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 or sfas sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the retained interest and gain or loss when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after december  with earlier adoption prohibited 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which amends sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas sfas requires each company with derivative instruments to disclose information about how and why it uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas  and how derivative instruments and hedged items affect its financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
the required disclosures include the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains or losses in tabular format  information about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements  counterparty credit risk  and the company s strategies and objectives for using derivative instruments 
sfas expands the current disclosure framework in sfas no 
sfas is effective prospectively for periods beginning on or after november  we do not utilize derivative instruments and  therefore  do not expect that there will be any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange risk as of december  and  approximately  and million respectively  of our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments were denominated in canadian dollars 
as a result  the carrying value of our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments may be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations 
at 
table of contents december   a strengthening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar would have no material effect for the year ended december  in addition  we purchase goods and services denominated primarily in us and canadian currencies and  to a lesser extent  in certain european currencies 
to manage our canadian dollar exposure to foreign exchange risk  we have considered  but generally do not utilize  derivative instruments 
the effect of exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results in the future 
during and the comparative periods presented  we did not enter into any foreign exchange forward or other derivative contracts in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaling million and million as of december  and we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of these assets as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short term nature of our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
a basis point decline in interest rates  occurring january  and sustained throughout the period ended december   would result in a decline in investment income of approximately  for that same period
