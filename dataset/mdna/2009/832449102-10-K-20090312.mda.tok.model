item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary smithtown bancorp  inc  is a holding company formed in  engaged primarily in commercial banking through its wholly owned bank subsidiary  bank of smithtown 
the bank offers a full array of consumer and commercial deposit and lending products and services through its nineteen branch offices as well as limited deposit services through its online banking site 
the bank also provides insurance and financial products through its two wholly owned subsidiaries  bank of smithtown insurance agents and brokers  inc and bank of smithtown financial services  inc for the following discussion  the consolidated entity is referred to as the company and the bank and its subsidiaries are referred to as the bank 
there were several significant factors that affected the company s financial condition and results of operations during the discussion of these factors should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements 
the turmoil in the financial markets earmarked as one of the most troubling times experienced by the financial system since the great depression 
three major investment banking firms no longer exist as they did prior to  and two additional firms have become banks 
the us government took over fannie mae and freddie mac  and bailed out a giant insurance company and two megabanks 
two of the largest bank failures in history took place during  as did the acquisition of two other very large banks 
two of the largest us auto manufacturers were bailed out by the us government  and the federal reserve bank lowered its target rate to an unprecedented range of 
bank stocks dropped in price at rapid rates including the stock price of certain banks whose performance remained good 
smithtown bancorp was one of those banks 
it was a year of unprecedented growth for the company 
opportunities were seized upon that never existed before for the bank  and results were positive 
asset growth of was fueled by loan growth of over million 
this loan growth was almost entirely in the real estate sector  with growth in commercial real estate of  in multi family housing of and in single family residences of 
construction lending increased by  although the majority of this lending included drawdowns on previously committed lines of credit 
the company s earnings per share for were as compared to for  an increase of 
net income of  was yet another record level of income for the company  an increase of  over the level 
various factors contributed to the growth in earnings this year  although the overriding factor was the growth in loans 
net interest margin declined by forty eight basis points during the year  from at yearend to at yearend this decline in margin was a direct result of the basis point decline in the prime rate during the year 
although some loan rates immediately reprice downward upon a drop in the prime rate  there is no such immediate commensurate drop in deposit rates 
at december   million of the company s commercial and construction loans and home equity lines of credit were indexed to the prime rate  and therefore rates on these loans decreased immediately  unless a floor was in place and had already been reached 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  however  rates decline much more slowly  particularly due to the continued strong competitive pressures of other banks and financial institutions all attempting to gain  or at a minimum  retain deposits 
during the first quarter of  deposits were often priced irrationally  and as a result the company decided to allow funds to flow out of the bank  rather than getting caught up in the rate competition that was going on at the time 
indicative of this irrational pricing early in the year  just a short time later some of the banks participating in this rate war failed and were taken over by larger institutions 
margin was also impacted by the increased borrowings required this year to fund a portion of the newly originated loans  although the average cost of these borrowings at was lower than the bank s cost of deposits of 
noninterest income for the year decreased slightly due in the majority to an other than temporary impairment otti writedown of of a trust preferred pooled security 
this security is made up of a pool of banks located throughout the country  varying in size from community banks to regional banks 
due to the deteriorated credit quality of some of the banks within the pool  the reduction in reserve collateral of the remaining issue and the lack of evidence to support the continued payments of all principal and interest according to original contractual terms  current mark to market accounting rules required the writedown of this security 
however  as of february  all payments of principal and interest have been received for this security 
noninterest expense grew by this year 
the largest growth of expense was in occupancy and equipment expense as a result of the company s continued geographical expansion 
four new branch locations were opened during  with all their associated costs hitting bottom line 
these new branch offices  however  along with the company s other fifteen locations  helped provide much of the funding for the loan growth experienced this year 
an additional seven new branch locations expected to open during will provide a majority of the funding for continued loan growth during the increase in noninterest expense during was also a result of a greatly increased provision for loan losses 
during this provision expense was  as compared to  for although there is no regulatory requirement as to the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans  as loan balances grew significantly throughout the year  management s analysis of asset quality and safety guidelines lead to the decision to increase provision expense for the year 
no financial institution is immune to the current credit crisis  and as such the bank saw an increase in its nonperforming loans in these nonperforming loans still remain at a low level as compared to peer group banks 
all of the bank s credit quality ratios continue to be significantly better than these peers 
during  the company s investment portfolio remained stable in size  although the composition of the portfolio changed 
obligations of us government agencies declined by  while holdings of mortgage backed securities increased by over their levels 
this was primarily the result of called agency securities being replaced with comparable yielding mortgage backed securities 
average yield on the securities portfolio rose by thirty five basis points from yearend to yearend the investment portfolio provides interest income to the company and is a source of liquidity  but it is primarily used to provide collateral for deposits of local municipalities 
the company s holdings of restricted securities increased by over  during the year 
these securities are made up of primarily federal home loan bank stock that is required to be held in an amount proportionate to the level of outstanding advances 
the stock earned dividends during and yielded a return to the bank 
bank premises and equipment increased dramatically this year 
an increase of was due to the addition of the four new branch locations  as well as the construction in progress at various other new leasehold properties 
these assets will continue to increase at a rapid pace in as at least seven new locations are slated for opening during the year 
deposit growth during was also very high 
this growth of over  or was achieved primarily in the bank s core deposits 
these deposits include checking  savings  money market and certificates of deposit under one hundred thousand dollars 
approximately one half of this growth in deposits was from the company s new branches  including its newest online branch 
the segmentation of the deposit portfolio changed slightly during  with money market accounts and certificates of deposit now representing and of total deposits as compared to and  respectively  at yearend the cost of these deposits declined by almost one hundred basis points during  and now have an average rate of as compared to in borrowings also increased significantly during  as the need for additional funding to support the company s loan growth was required 
these borrowings were all in the form of federal home loan bank advances  with varying structures and rates 
they are primarily collateralized with the company s residential real estate loans and some commercial real estate loans 
additional credit availability to the company through the federal home loan bank remains high 
during the first quarter of  the company formed a trust that issued  of floating rate trust preferred securities due in june the securities bear an interest rate of month libor plus basis points 
the company issued subordinated debentures to the trust in exchange for the proceeds of the offering 
the company may redeem the subordinated debentures  in whole or in part  at a premium declining ratably to par on june  during the third quarter of  the company also issued a private placement of common equity 
as a result of this equity issuance   shares of common stock were added to the existing  shares 
this growth in capital was used to support the growth in loans achieved during the year 
at yearend the company s capital ratios were all within the well capitalized range 
tier i leverage capital was  tier i risk based capital was and total risk based capital was 
in summary  was a very challenging year for financial institutions  with unprecedented events occurring regularly 
in spite of the tumultuous economy  smithtown bancorp remained true to its core business of providing the highest quality of loans to its customers and acquiring as many core deposits as possible at reasonable rates 
by continuing to follow these goals  was another record year for the company  a true accomplishment in light of current economic conditions 
the company s return on equity for the year was  and its efficiency ratio was 
the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total noninterest expense  net of the provisions for income tax  otti and probable incurred loan losses  by total revenues  net of total interest expense 
net income grew by and year over year eps growth reached 
the company expanded its geographical footprint by over 
will continue to present its challenges  but the company will remain faithful to its long term goal of returning the highest possible shareholder value within the limits of safety and soundness 
application of critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported asset and liability balances and revenue and expense amounts 
the company s determination of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is based on its subjective evaluation of a variety of factors at a specific point in time and involves difficult and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that management s estimate needs to be adjusted based on  among other things  additional information that comes to light after the estimate is made or changes in circumstances  such adjustment could result in the need for a significantly different allowance for loan losses and thereby materially impact  either positively or negatively  the bank s results of operations 
the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through a provision for loan losses based on probable incurred losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio 
management  through its asset quality committee  comprised of several members of executive management as well as the chief collection officer  evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis 
adjustments are made at this time to a level deemed adequate by the committee  based on its risk evaluation of the portfolio in its entirety as well as in specific loan details 
the allowance is comprised of both individual valuation allowances and loan pool valuation allowances 
the bank monitors its entire loan portfolio on a regular basis  with consideration given to detailed analysis of classified loans  repayment patterns  and probable incurred losses  past loss experience  current economic conditions and various types of concentrations of credit 
additions to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses  net of recoveries  are charged to the allowance 
individual valuation allowances are established in connection with specific loan reviews and the asset classification process  including the procedures for impairment testing under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  an amendment of sfas statements no 
and  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures  an amendment of sfas statement no 
such valuation  which includes a review of loans for which full collectibility in accordance with contractual terms is not reasonably assured  considers the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less the costs to sell  if any  or the present value of expected future cash flows  or the loan s observable market value 
any shortfall that exists from this analysis results in a specific allowance for the loan 
pursuant to the company s policy  loan losses must be charged off in the period the loans  or portions thereof  are deemed uncollectible 
assumptions and judgments by management  in conjunction with outside sources  are used to determine whether full collectibility of a loan is not reasonably assured 
assumptions and judgments also are used to determine the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral or the present value of expected future cash flows or the loan s observable market value 
individual valuation allowances could differ materially as a result of changes in these assumptions and judgments 
individual loan analyses are periodically performed on specific loans considered impaired 
the results of the individual valuation allowances are aggregated and included in the overall allowance for loan losses 
in addition to estimating losses for loans individually deemed to be impaired  management also estimates collective impairment losses for pools of loans that are not specifically reviewed 
statistical information regarding the bank s historical loss experience over a period of time believed to be relevant is weighted very heavily in management s estimate of such losses 
however  future losses could vary significantly from those experienced in the past 
in addition  management also considers a variety of general qualitative factors and then subjectively determines the amount of weight to assign to each in estimating losses 
the factors include  among others  national and local economic conditions  environmental risks  trends in volume and terms of loans  concentrations of credit  changes in lending policies and procedures  and experience  ability  and depth of the bank s lending staff 
because of the nature of the factors and the difficulty in assessing their impact  management s resulting estimate of losses may not accurately reflect actual losses in the portfolio 
although the allowance for loan losses has two separate components  one for impairment losses on individual loans and one for collective impairment losses on pools of loans  the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb realized losses as they occur whether they relate to individual loans or pools of loans 
at december   management believed the allowance for loan losses had been established and maintained at a level adequate to reflect the probable incurred losses in the bank s loan portfolio 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the sufficiency of funds available to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers and to access unanticipated earnings enhancement opportunities for company growth 
liquidity management addresses the ability to meet deposit withdrawals either on demand or contractual maturity  to repay other borrowings as they mature and to make new loans and investments as opportunities arise 
the company s principal source of liquidity is dividends from the bank 
due to regulatory restrictions  dividends from the bank to the company at december  were limited to  which represented the bank s net income and the net retained earnings from the previous two years 
however  as a practical matter  dividends would be limited to amounts necessary to maintain a well capitalized status  or approximately  the dividends received from the bank are used primarily for dividends to the stockholders  and also for interest payments on the subordinated debt 
in the event that the company subsequently expands its current operations  in addition to dividends from the bank  it will need to rely on its own earnings  additional capital raised and other borrowings to meet liquidity needs 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  securities available for sale and securities held to maturity due within one year 
the levels of these assets are dependent upon the bank s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
other sources of liquidity include loan and security principal repayments and maturities  lines of credit with other financial institutions including the federal home loan bank  and growth in core deposits 
while scheduled loan amortization  maturing securities and short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan and mortgage backed securities prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank adjusts its liquidity levels as appropriate to meet funding needs such as seasonal deposit outflows  loans  and asset and liability management objectives 
the goal of asset liability management is the combination of maintaining adequate liquidity levels without sacrificing earnings 
the bank s objective in asset liability management is to match the maturity of its assets and liabilities in a way that takes advantage of the current and anticipated rate environment 
asset liability management is a primary function of management and is reviewed on an ongoing basis 
the chief executive officer  all executive vice presidents  the vice president of retail  the comptroller and the vice president for financial reporting serve on the asset liability management committee 
historically  the bank has relied on its deposit base as its principal source of funding 
however  in recent years  various sources of funding have become available to the bank in increasing magnitudes 
these additional sources may be more attractive to the bank at different times based on market interest rates and other competitive factors 
management views all sources of funding as acceptable and makes decisions as to which sources are more advantageous at the time of need 
the discriminate use of different sources of funding at different points in time has contributed to higher interest margins and overall net income for the bank during and at december  the bank had the ability to borrow on aggregate  unsecured lines of credit of  with unaffiliated correspondent banks 
none of this credit was outstanding at yearend  and therefore all  was available for use 
the bank has the ability  as a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb system  to borrow against unencumbered residential and commercial mortgages owned by the bank 
at december    of these funds was available yet for borrowing 
the following table represents management s expectations regarding the estimated cash flow of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  this table has been derived based on internal data and management s assumptions  and not necessarily the contractual terms for repayment or redemption 
the amounts shown below could also be significantly affected by external factors such as changes in prepayment assumptions  changes in market interest rates that are not matched by the company  early withdrawals of deposits and competition 
therefore  this information does not reflect the effect of repricing rights or the impact of repricing on interest income or expense 
the following significant assumptions were used in developing the following table a time deposits reflect contractual maturities  b money market accounts are rate sensitive and accordingly  all accounts have been included as withdrawable within the first five years and c savings and now accounts are not as rate sensitive to withdrawal as money market accounts  therefore a higher percentage of these accounts are reflected in the over one year through five years category 
these assumptions are based on management s historical analysis of market interest rates and levels of the company s deposits over the past ten years 
three months or less over three months through six months over six months through one year total within one year over one year through five years over five years other total assets investment securities federal funds sold term placements loans cash and due from banks bank premises equipment other assets deferred loan fees allowance for loan losses total liabilities and stockholders equity savings money market now time deposits of  or more other time deposits demand deposits other borrowed money subordinated debt other liabilities stockholders equity total cash flow gap per period cash flow gap to total assets cumulative cash flow gap cumulative cash flow gap to total assets analysis of net interest income vs 
net interest income  the primary contributor to earnings  represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends upon the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them 
during the bank s net interest margin decreased basis points  resulting primarily from the reduced yield on the loan portfolio 
overall  the bank s yield on its total interest earning assets decreased basis points  from in to in while the increased average balance of loans reflects the tremendous growth in the loan portfolio from to  the overall yield on loans dropped from in to in the prime rate dropped seven times in  from to  which substantially lowered the yield on the bank s prime based loans  including commercial loans  which were up million with a lower average yield of basis points and construction and land loans  which were up almost million with a drop in yield of basis points 
the largest increase in the loan portfolio was by far and away in commercial mortgages  with an increase in average balance of over million with a lower average yield  from in to in despite the precipitous drop in interest rates  interest on loans increased  the lower average balance of the bank s investment securities from to is indicative of management s decision not to replace matured or called securities unless required by the bank s municipal deposit levels 
the yield on investment securities increased basis points as lower yielding investments either matured or were called in included in other interest earning assets is federal home loan bank stock 
the bank must purchase stock in proportion to its level of federal home loan bank borrowings 
the increased average balance of almost million is a result of the much higher level of borrowings the bank had during the average yield on these dividends decreased basis points 
on the funding side  by far and away the largest increase was in federal home loan bank borrowings 
the bank took advantage of extremely attractive rates to fund a sizable portion of its loan growth in the average balance of borrowings increased almost million with a corresponding decrease in the average cost of basis points 
total interest bearing deposits increased million with a decrease in average cost of basis points 
the largest deposit increase was in time deposits followed by money market accounts 
time deposits were up million and money market accounts were up million 
as a reflection of the overall lower interest rate environment in  rates were down and basis points for time deposits and money market accounts  respectively 
savings and now accounts saw a modest increase in as the cost of these deposits remained virtually unchanged 
the bank issued million in trust preferred securities in march to bolster its capital ratios  effecting an increase of million on average with a drop in cost of basis points from its average cost in the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s average consolidated statements of financial condition and its consolidated statements of income for the years indicated and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the years indicated

the following table illustrates the extent to which changes in interest rates and in volume of average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the bank s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rates multiplied by prior volume  and the net changes 
for purposes of this table  changes  which are not due solely to volume or rate changes  have been allocated to these categories based on the respective percentage changes in average volume and rate 
due to the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during the period analyzed  it is not possible to precisely allocate changes between volume and rates

overall  net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  increased  or 
the increase is attributable to the higher volume of net interest earning assets  which gave rise to increased net interest income of  tempered by the decrease in interest rates  which produced an unfavorable effect on net interest income of  variances in volume the unprecedented growth in the bank s loan portfolio resulted in the total average balance increasing million in  led by commercial mortgages  which increased million  or a very robust 
the next largest increase in the loan portfolio was construction and land loans  with an increase of million  or  followed by residential mortgages  up million  or and commercial loans  with an increase of million  or 
the majority of the increase in residential mortgages was in the multi family housing sector 
the bank continued to take advantage of opportunities not necessarily available to it prior to mid to late the volume of investment securities was lower in as the vast majority of the funding was channeled into lending 
the average balance of the bank s investment portfolio decreased million as maturities and called securities were not necessarily replaced in a total of  of us government agency bonds was called   matured and  was sold for a gain of us government agency bonds purchased in were  purchases of mortgage backed securities totaled  in  and one mortgage backed security of  was sold for a gain of there was a total of  matured in the bank s municipal bond portfolio  while purchases totaled only one trust preferred security was purchased for  the bank strives to mitigate its federal funds sold position as much as possible and was able to do so in due to its huge volume of loans 
the average balance in of federal funds sold was only  down from  in finally  on the asset side of the balance sheet  the bank s obligation to purchase federal home loan bank stock rose sharply in  reflected in the higher average balance of  compared to  in these stock holdings increased proportionately with the bank s level of federal home loan bank borrowings 
on the liability side  the average balance of federal home loan bank borrowings rose sharply in  by million 
the bank utilized its borrowing capacity at fhlb to fund a substantial portion of its loan growth in deposits  overall  increased by million on average  generated in a large part by the bank s new branch offices 
borrowings from fhlb bridged the gap between deposit growth and loan growth during the increase in deposits was generated by time deposits  which increased  or on average  and money market accounts  which increased million  or 
the overall percentage increase in average deposits was 
in march  the bank issued million in trust preferred securities  effecting an increase in the average balance of subordinate debt from  to  demand deposits rose  on average  or 
variances in rate the average rate on interest earning assets decreased basis points  or 
the average yield on the bank s loan portfolio dropped from to  a drop of 
the increase in interest on loans due to higher volume was  offset by the decrease due to lower interest rates of  the yield on investment securities actually increased from to due to the runoff of lower yielding investments which were either called or matured in the yield on federal home loan bank stock dropped from to as the federal home loan bank dropped its dividend rate to in the fourth quarter of the bank s overall cost of funds  including deposits  borrowings and trust preferred securities was in the cost of fhlb borrowings dropped from in to in this  coupled with the huge increase in average balance  had a profound impact on the bank s funding cost in other than savings and demand deposits  borrowing in the wholesale market was the least expensive funding vehicle in the bank s borrowing capacity increases with certain residential and commercial real estate loans that the bank originates and then pledges against its borrowings 
borrowing from the fhlb will continue in as needed  although to a lesser degree with the anticipated inflow of deposits from the scheduled branch openings in along with the continued momentum of the branches recently opened in the average cost of time deposits decreased basis points  or  and money market accounts by basis points  or just under 
money market accounts  more than any other deposit product  are rate sensitive  and as such  may be more immediately reflective of changes in interest rates 
the average cost of subordinated debt  or trust preferred security issuances  dropped from to 
these borrowings represent an expensive funding vehicle for the bank  however the funds are eligible within limits for inclusion in tier i capital  and in their entirety  as total risk based capital 
the net interest rate spread dropped basis points from to  or  and the interest rate margin dropped from in to in  a decrease of 
for vs 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis  increased by  or  from to this increase was due to the combination of an increased volume of interest earning assets of  and a decreased rate variance of seventeen basis points 
variances in volume during  the average volume of federal funds sold increased by 
this increase was a result of timing differences related to deposit collection and loan closings 
by december   the balance in federal funds sold actually declined to from its balance at december  investment securities declined in average balance by  as a result of matured and called securities which were not replaced 
during the year   of par value in securities were called or matured 
of this  in par value   were obligations of us government agencies   were obligations of state and political subdivisions and were other securities 
also during the year  the bank purchased  in par value of additional securities  of which  were us government agency securities and  were other securities 
the bank also sold  in par value over the twelve month period in  resulting in a net gain of these securities were sold during a time when the volume of loan closings were high and borrowings would have been more costly 
the average volume of loans increased by  or during gross new originations for the year totaled  and gross satisfactions including payoffs and principal reductions totaled  of the total new originations  were variable rate products 
the largest area of growth in loans was in commercial mortgages  which grew in average balance by  during the year 
the second and third largest areas of growth were in the construction and land portfolios and the residential mortgage portfolios 
these two segments of the total portfolio grew in average balance by  and  respectively 
these statistics validate the company s goals as well as the changing market conditions of  which point toward originating more permanent type loans than construction loans due to their longer term and lower risk 
the company s deposits grew in average balance by  or  almost perfectly matched to the growth in average loan balances 
the largest growth in deposit average balances was in the money market segment of the portfolio 
these average balances increased by  during the company s elite money market product was very competitive in rate throughout and hence attracted a high volume of new accounts 
the next two largest segments of growth in average balances were in certificates of deposit and savings accounts 
these two segments grew by  and  respectively 
although time deposits grew in average balance during the year  they were not a prime focus of deposit collection 
the company s premium savings account  however  which pays a very competitive rate of interest for balances over  was a high focus account 
the trend for deposit collection was certainly away from non rate sensitive deposit products into more rate sensitive products  for which the bank has a higher degree of control 
the average balance of borrowings for the company during was reduced by  fhlb advance levels actually decreased from  to  during the year 
the average level of the company s subordinated debt increased minimally by  the actual balance of this debt remained unchanged from december  to december  variances in rate the average rate on interest earning assets increased by basis points from yearend to yearend that increase was primarily a result of the increase in yield on the company s loan balances  which totaled fourteen basis points 
the yield on the company s investment portfolio and federal funds sold also increased significantly by basis points and basis points  respectively  but the overall contribution to total average yield was significantly less due to the size of the securities and federal funds sold portfolios 
the average cost of the company s total interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points from december  to december  the major contributor to this increased cost was the increase in average rate paid on money market accounts  which grew by basis points or 
the increased cost for savings balances was basis points during the year  but the effect of this increase was smaller due to the lower percentage of volume in these balances 
the average cost of time deposits grew by only basis points during  another validation of the company s decision to not pay up for these balances 
the net increase in cost of the company s borrowings and subordinated debt were a minimal basis points 
there were no increases in volume in either of these liabilities from december  to december   as internally generated deposits were able to totally fund the increase in loan balances 
the result of the above changes in average rate and volume resulted in a reduced net interest margin of fourteen basis points for the year 
net interest margin remains the company s primary source of net income 
loans the company s loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by commercial and residential properties located within the bank s market area as well as within the five boroughs of new york city 
during  these real estate loans comprised of the total loan portfolio 
during the company s loan portfolio grew by  more than triple the average growth over the prior four years 
this exceptional growth was the result of the economic environment of  which created opportunities for the company that were not as available to it in the past 
many of the company s competitors were forced to curtail lending due to capital and liquidity constraints caused by sub prime mortgage problems and other difficulties 
other competitors were acquired by large  out of state companies that were less focused on mortgage lending in the company s market area 
the conduit market for mortgage loans also was eliminated in  and as a result  there were greatly increased opportunities for permanent commercial mortgages as well seasoned multi family residential mortgages 
as can be seen from the below portfolio segregation  the largest percentage of growth was in the residential real estate portfolio  growing by 
of this growth  loans on multi family buildings grew by 
these loans are secured by fully tenanted buildings with average loan to value ratios of 
loans on one to four family homes grew by during the year 
the average loan to value on these properties was 
commercial mortgages increased in volume second to residential mortgages 
again the properties securing these loans are generally fully tenanted with well seasoned cash flows  with average loan to value ratios of 
consistent with reduced construction activity on long island and somewhat reduced activity in new york city  construction lending slowed in volume from past years 
the growth in this segment of the portfolio was  as compared to during construction lending during was focused on residential properties including multi family and condominium buildings 
in spite of the current downturn in the economy  with the resultant increase in loan losses absorbed by many other banks  the company s loan portfolio remains strong 
however  the bank is not immune to the credit and liquidity problems that exist within its market area  and as such  there has been an increase in nonperforming loans 
as in past years  and particularly during  credit deterioration is mitigated by sound underwriting criteria  multiple levels of credit review  stratification analysis  and stress analysis which are now critical to maintaining the highest level of asset quality 
the following table sets forth the major classifications of loans real estate loans  construction real estate loans  other commercial residential agricultural commercial and industrial loans loans to individuals for household  family and other personal expenditures all other loans including overdrafts total loans total nonperforming loans at december  and were  and the growth in one of the nonperforming loan categories ninety days past due and still accruing was concentrated in two separate land and construction projects to the same borrower for a number of three family residences 
foreclosure actions are about to begin in on both projects 
the nonaccrual segment of nonperforming loans consists of a first lien land mortgage of  and a second lien construction loan of for the building of a single family residence in an affluent north shore community of suffolk county 
the company has taken steps to preserve the construction completed to date 
a foreclosure action has been commenced 
in this nonaccrual category is also a single family residence in process of foreclosure 
a current appraisal yields a loan to value ratio 
the final segment of non performing loans includes a single property in other real estate owned 
the loan was written down to its appraised value of  less all expected selling expenses totaling  current appraisals remain at the same level 
several improvements have been undertaken since the company took possession leading to upgrades and increased tenancy 
management continues its efforts to sell the property 
the following table shows the maturities of loans excluding real estate mortgages and installment loans outstanding as of december  within one year after one year but within five years after five years total fixed rate loans commercial and all other loans including overdrafts variable rate loans commercial and all other loans including overdrafts real estate construction total analysis of the allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses at december  and was  and  the change in the allowance account is comprised of net charge offs of and a provision for loan losses of  based on specific reserves for internally classified loans and multiple factors including historical experience and current economic conditions  management feels the level of the allowance for loan losses provides adequate coverage 
at december   the bank s reserve ratio the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of end of period loans was 
at december  this same ratio stood at 
the decrease in the reserve coverage ratio is due to the planned migration of the portfolio into lower risk lending including multi family residential  one to four family residential  and prime commercial mortgages 
it is also additionally supported by the company s low historical loss experience  as well as low delinquency and nonperforming experience 
management believes this level of reserves to be adequate due to the quality of the portfolio 
the company s reserve ratio remains within the range of selected peer group banks 
the allowance for loan losses is an amount that management currently believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  there is not an exact amount but rather a range for what constitutes an appropriate allowance 
as more fully discussed in the application of critical accounting policies section of this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the process for estimating credit losses and determining the allowance for loan losses as of any balance sheet date is subjective in nature and requires material estimates 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
the following tables describe the activity in the allowance for loan losses account followed by key loan ratios for the years ended allowance for loan losses at beginning of period loans charged off commercial real estate consumer total loans charged off recoveries on amounts previously charged off commercial real estate consumer total recoveries net charge offs recoveries reclassification to allowance for contingent liabilities current year s provision for loan losses allowance for loan losses at end of period total loans average loans  net end of period net of unearned discount ratios net charge offs recoveries to average loans loans at end of period allowance for loan losses provision for loan losses previous year s charge offs to current year s recoveries allowance for loan losses at yearend to average loans net of unearned discount end of period loans net of unearned discount allocation of allowance for loan losses the following table sets forth the allocation of the company s allowance for loan losses by loan category and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans receivable  net  at the dates indicated 
the portion of the loan loss allowance allocated to each loan category does not represent the total available for future losses which may occur within the loan category since the total loan loss allowance is a valuation allocation applicable to the entire loan portfolio 
the level of unallocated reserves was arrived at after an in depth analysis of the unique characteristics of the company s portfolio 
factors such as the high growth rate of the portfolio over the past several years  the historical performance of the portfolio including delinquencies  net charge off ratios and the level of nonperforming loans have been considered in determining the level of unallocated reserves 
additional factors including local economic conditions  loan concentrations  and the experience level of lending staff  all contribute to the final determination of the unallocated portion of the allowance

it is the company s policy to charge off these overdrafts after they have remained outstanding for days  but for regulatory purposes they are considered nonaccrual loans after days

these debentures represent the sole assets of the trusts  the proceeds of which were used in the ordinary course of business  primarily to fund the bank s new loan originations 
stockholders equity stockholders equity increased by from yearend to yearend the largest part of this increase resulted from the private issuance of public equity that took place during the third quarter

the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the company  including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and federal agencies  particularly the federal reserve board 
recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion regarding the impact of new accounting standards  refer to note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
noninterest income  noninterest expense and income taxes for vs 
total noninterest income decreased by during  largely due to the effect of the other than temporary impairment write down of on a trust preferred pooled security 
this security  as discussed in the management s discussion and analysis section  has continued to date to pay all principal and interest payments per contractual agreement 
due to mark to market accounting  it was necessary to write the security down to its current market value  as determined by management 
it still remains management s intention to hold the remaining security to recovery 
other items of noninterest income rose during the year 
service charges on deposit accounts  including overdraft and uncollected balance fees  increased by due to the implementation of new overdraft software that provides greatly improved collection services 
the fees collected from the company s financial services subsidiary increased this year by 
the agency has increased its breadth of customers through an alliance with bos insurance agents and brokers  inc an area of large increased noninterest income was in net fees received from the company s atm and debit cards 
during  the company eliminated the third party processor for these transactions and took the processing in house 
this conversion resulted in a large savings to the bank  provided more control over these functions to the bank  and allows for quick and seamless additions to the network that was not available in prior years 
this process was enabled by the jack henry core software that was purchased in the amount of savings and resultant increase to noninterest income because of this conversion was over  or 
a reduction in noninterest income during resulted from a lower return on bank owned life insurance policies 
these policies were purchased to provide attractive investments during the service period of various benefit plans provided by the bank  such as group term life insurance  director and executive incentive retirement plans and a supplemental executive retirement agreement for the chief executive officer 
the average rate of return on the insurance policies  on a tax equivalent basis  declined by over basis points in revenues from the bank s insurance subsidiary  bank of smithtown insurance agents and brokers  inc  declined slightly in by  or  as a result of a softened insurance market 
total noninterest expense increased by during as in  the commonality of all expense growth was due to the company s growth in both geography and asset size 
salary and benefit costs increased by  or  significantly lower than the increase of over the cost for the company s medical insurance increased by for the year ended a percentage of this increase was absorbed by the employees  but was retained by the bank 
the expense for providing pension benefits to the employees increased by over the board of directors approved an increase in the bank s contribution for the employee stock ownership plan esop for the year 
based on the performance of the company s stock over the past years  participation in the esop has become one of the most valuable benefits provided to the employees 
additional increased benefit costs during were the expenses related to the director and executive incentive retirement plans and the supplemental executive retirement agreement 
occupancy expenses rose by  primarily as a result of increased office rental expenses  directly attributable to the company s larger geographical footprint 
these expenses will continue to increase during and as several additional locations are opened 
depreciation of leasehold improvements also increased by during the year  again a result of the construction of additional branch locations as well as the renovation of two existing branches 
the reduced amortization expense for intangible assets resulted from the accelerated accounting method used to record the expense 
the highest percentage of this expense is recorded during the first years of the acquisition 
as the company purchased the seigerman mulvey insurance agency over three years ago  the expense for the amortization of the intangible assets acquired is now in its final  lower expense years 
other noninterest expenses increased by 
as there are many components of other expenses  this discussion will focus on its major categories 
business development expense increased significantly  by  during primarily due to a greatly increased level of advertising and marketing 
this increased expense was largely due to the advertising related to the new branch offices and promotional deposit products offered throughout the year 
of the  of other noninterest expenses  one of the largest components and also one of the largest increases was the cost for fdic insurance 
prior to  the bank s cost for deposit insurance was limited to its share of the finance corporation fico expense 
beginning at the end of the second quarter of  as the balance in the fdic insurance fund was low  once again banking institutions began paying premiums for deposit insurance 
this premium for was over  and represented a increase in cost over during  this same fdic expense rose to  an increase of over 
this cost is expected to continue on an upward trend as the level of the company s deposits increase  and the level of insured deposits increases 
on february  the fdic adopted an interim rule setting a specific assessment of twenty basis points for the second quarter of to be collected september  the fdic is currently receiving comments on the interim rule  which are due thirty days after its publication in the federal register 
if this special assessment remains as set forth in the interim rule  based on currently available information  the company estimates that the one time special assessment could increase its fdic insurance expense by approximately million for the second quarter of since the fdic issued this interim rule  chairman sheila bair has announced the fdic s intention to cut this special assessment in half from twenty to ten basis points provided that congress expands the fdic s line of credit with the treasury 
if this special assessment is halved  based on currently available information  the company estimates its fdic insurance expense could increase by million for the second quarter of costs to provide online banking services increased dramatically again from to this was a result of a greatly increased number of users of online banking services  as well as the cost of the newly constructed website and software that enables customers to open accounts at the company s newest online branch 
the new online branch offers savings and certificates of deposit to new customers who will only transact business through this online channel 
the online branch was opened on november  and to date has collected over million in deposit balances 
for vs 
total noninterest income remained relatively flat during  with just a slight reduction in fee income of the largest growth in noninterest income was in the gain in cash value of company owned life insurance 
these policies were purchased to provide attractive investments during the service period of various benefit plans provided by the bank  such as group term life insurance  director and executive incentive retirement plans and a supplemental executive retirement agreement for the chief executive officer 
a partial exchange from general to separate account policies resulted in greater rates of return as well as lower risk based capital requirements 
the overall return on the policies  on a tax equivalent basis  rose by over basis points 
another component of noninterest income is fees from the bank s debit cards 
these fees increased by from the year ending december  to december  the volume of debit card usage has grown to a level that almost exceeds the volume of checks written 
income from the bank s trust and investment services division remained relatively flat from yearend to yearend this division represents income from the bank s subsidiary  bank of smithtown financial services inc as well as from its trust department 
last year s settlement of several large estates and trusts increased income for  but was not duplicated during these types of fees represent one time commissions and are not recognized until the accounts are closed or in the case of an estate  the estate is settled 
total assets under trust management actually decreased by  during as these assets were distributed 
fees from bank of smithtown financial services inc increased by or during  as a result of increased commission income 
another component of noninterest income is service charges on deposit accounts  which increased by or over this additional income generation was the result of an improved collection process resulting from the conversion to the jack henry core banking software and primarily represents additional overdraft fee income 
revenues from the bank s insurance subsidiary  bank of smithtown insurance agents and brokers  inc  declined by or as a result of a softened insurance market 
as premiums were reduced during  the resulting commission income to the agency also declined 
during  the agency purchased the assets of payne and palmieri  inc  a smaller insurance agency located in east setauket  primarily to add to the number of insurance carriers with whom they place their business 
it is expected that additional revenues from personal and commercial lines will also be generated as the agency retains and expands the customer base of payne and palmieri  inc net gains on the sale of investment securities declined during  as the interest rate environment for the majority of the year did not return large gains 
the sale of investment securities is transacted in order to replace lower yielding securities with higher yielding loans 
it remains the intent of management to hold most securities to maturity 
total noninterest expense increased by during once again the commonality of all expense growth was due to the company s growth in both geography and asset size 
salaries and benefit cost increased by  or 
the cost for the company s medical insurance increased by for the year ended  a direct result of an increase in premium rates 
a percentage of this increase was absorbed by the employees  but was retained by the bank 
the expense for providing pension benefits to the employees increased by over the board of directors approved an increase in the bank s contribution for the employee stock ownership plan esop for the year 
based on the performance of the company s stock over the past years  participation in the esop has become one of the most valuable benefits provided to the employees 
additional increased benefit costs during were the expenses related to the director and executive incentive retirement plans and the supplemental executive retirement agreement 
occupancy expenses rose by  primarily a result of increased office rental expenses  directly attributable to the company s larger geographical footprint 
these expenses will continue to increase during and as several additional locations are opened 
depreciation of leasehold improvements also increased by during the year  again a result of the construction of additional branch locations as well as the renovation of two existing branches and the move of the bank s trust department to its current location in the smithtown branch building 
furniture and equipment expense increased by as a result of the same factors discussed above as well as the conversion of the company s core banking software system 
the former computer software system used to run a majority of the bank s processes no longer provided the full range of products  services and  more importantly  efficiencies required by the company 
a core banking team was formed to study various software providers and their products  and after careful cost benefit analyses work was completed  the team presented their recommendation to senior management 
the jack henry software was chosen and the conversion was completed during the memorial day weekend 
although the cost for the software was high  there have already been many recorded savings and efficiencies resulting from the new product 
the bank has also increased its level of demand deposits as a direct result of an additional service now offered which was not available prior to the conversion 
the reduced amortization expense for intangible assets resulted from the accelerated accounting method used to record the expense 
the highest percentage of this expense is recorded during the first years of the acquisition 
as the company purchased the seigerman mulvey insurance agency over three years ago  the expense for the amortization of the intangible assets acquired is in its final  lower expense years now 
other expenses increased by 
as there are many components of other expenses  this discussion will focus on its major categories 
business development expense declined during primarily due to a reduced level of advertising and marketing 
this reduced expense was partially due to the company s decision to not compete in irrationally priced certificate of deposit campaigns 
reduced interest expense and advertising expense were the benefits of this decision 
of the of increased other expenses  one of the largest increases was the cost for fdic insurance 
prior to  the bank s cost for deposit insurance was limited to its share of the fico expense 
beginning at the end of the second quarter of  as the balance in the fdic insurance fund was low  once again banking institutions began paying premiums for deposit insurance 
this premium for was over  and represented a increase in cost over costs to provide online banking services increased dramatically from to this was a result of a greatly increased number of users of online banking services as well as bill paying service 
other components of increased other expense resulted from the company s increased asset size as related to various regulatory and compliance issues 
some of these costs were one time expenses 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk significant increases in the level of market interest rates may adversely affect the fair value of securities and other interest earning assets 
at december  and  the following levels of securities and loans carried fixed interest rates balance of portfolio balance of portfolio investment securities loans generally  the value of fixed rate investments varies inversely to changes in interest rates 
as a result  increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the market value of interest earning assets 
this decrease in market value could adversely affect the company s results of operations if the loans or securities were sold or  in the case of interest earning assets classified as available for sale  could reduce the company s stockholders equity if they were to be retained 
a significant increase in the level of market interest rates could also adversely affect the bank s net interest income and net interest margin 
now accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts all can be repriced on a daily basis 
if they were all to be repriced upward due to the competitive pressures of a general increase in market rates  net interest income could be reduced 
based on historical experience  increases in deposit rates typically lag increases in loan rates  in which case  the increase in interest expense on these deposits would be offset by the increase in interest income on the loans 
the bank monitors and controls interest rate risk through a variety of techniques including the use of interest rate sensitivity models and interest rate gap analysis 
both of these techniques project future net interest income based on changes in interest rates 
gap analysis requires estimates of when all categories of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will reprice 
gap analysis looks at stated maturities and assumes all assets and liabilities within the same maturity time frame will reprice 
it does not look at the probability of repricing  which in the case of nonmaturity deposits  is up to the discretion of management 
interest rate sensitivity models also rely on various estimates and assumptions  and although a great deal of time and effort is devoted to arriving at these assumptions  any change in the assumptions input to the model can produce very different results 
therefore  both of these techniques may not accurately reflect the actual impact of changes in the interest rate environment on the bank s net interest income 
in spite of these shortcomings  the bank utilizes the results of the dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure to net interest income fluctuations resulting from sustained interest rate changes 
management monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon 
the results of the sensitivity analysis are compared to policy limits set internally by the asset liability committee that specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon given both an upward and downward shift in interest rates 
the last simulation analysis was modeled on a one hundred and two hundred basis point upward and one hundred basis point downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a twelve month period is assumed 
the following table reflects the bank s income sensitivity analysis as of november  and change in interest rates in basis points rate shock as of november  potential change in net interest income as of november  potential change in net interest income change change change change up basis points up basis points static down basis points
