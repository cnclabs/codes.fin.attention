overview we are a specialty healthcare company focused on the discovery  development  and commercialization of proprietary pharmaceuticals  imaging and diagnostic systems  and instruments for the treatment  diagnosis  and management of ophthalmic diseases and conditions 
our objective is to establish industry leading positions in large and rapidly growing segments of ophthalmology by leveraging our preclinical and development expertise and our novel and proprietary technologies 
we actively explore opportunities to acquire complementary pharmaceuticals  compounds  and technologies  which could  individually or in the aggregate  materially increase the scale of our business 
we also intend to explore strategic opportunities in other medical markets that would allow us to benefit from our business and global distribution expertise  and which have operational characteristics that are similar to ophthalmology  such as dermatology 

table of contents during  we continued to expand our portfolio of drug candidates and ophthalmic devices through several transactions 
on may   we acquired vidus ocular  inc  or vidus  and gained access to its aquashunt  an innovative shunt to treat glaucoma  the second leading cause of blindness in the us  in an all stock transaction 
in january  we initiated a clinical trial to study the safety and efficacy of aquashunt 
in june  we acquired exclusive worldwide rights in the field of ophthalmology to a novel small molecule agent in phase ii clinical development for the treatment of viral conjunctivitis and other viral infections 
in october  we acquired exclusive worldwide rights from teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd 
to teva s proprietary formulation of budesonide for the treatment of various inflammatory and allergic conditions of the eye 
on march   following the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee  or the idmc  we determined to terminate the ongoing phase iii clinical trial of bevasiranib 
review of the data by the idmc indicated that the trial as structured was unlikely to meet its primary end point 
however  preliminary data  needing further analysis  show activity of bevasiranib when used adjunctively with genentech s lucentis r  we intend to conduct a complete evaluation of the clinical data in an effort to determine appropriate next steps regarding the development of bevasiranib 
we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of bevasiranib  and our willingness to continue to develop bevasiranib will depend on our understanding of the trial data and the efficacy of the underlying technology 
we expect to incur substantial losses as we continue the development of our product candidates  continue our other research and development activities  and establish a sales and marketing infrastructure in anticipation of the commercialization of our product candidates 
we currently have limited commercialization capabilities  and it is possible that we may never successfully commercialize any of our pharmaceutical product candidates 
to date  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts towards research and development 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we do not currently generate revenue from any of our pharmaceutical product candidates and have only generated limited revenue from our instrumentation business 
our research and development activities are budgeted to expand over a period of time and will require further resources if we are to be successful 
as a result  we believe that our operating losses are likely to be substantial over the next several years 
we will need to obtain additional funds to further develop our research and development programs  and there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
results of operations for the years ended december  and december  the results of operations for the year ended december  include our operating results for the full year as compared to the year ended december   which include those of opko for the full period as well as the results of operations of acuity pharmaceuticals  inc  or acuity  from march  through december   and of ophthalmic technologies  inc  or oti  from november  through december   after their acquisitions

we are obligated to pay interest upon maturity  capitalized quarterly  on outstanding borrowings under the line of credit at a annual rate  which is due july  effective november   the maturity date on the line of credit was extended for a period of eighteen months from july  until january   and the annual interest rate was increased to from the amendment date forward 
the line of credit is collateralized by all of our personal property except our intellectual property 
on january   we repaid in full all outstanding amounts and terminated all of our commitments under a term loan with horizon financial funding company  llc  or horizon 
the loan had an interest rate of  and the principal was payable in equal monthly installments which commenced august we have not generated positive cash flow from operations  and we expect to incur losses from operations for the foreseeable future 
we expect to incur substantial research and development expenses  including expenses related to the hiring of personnel and additional clinical trials 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will also increase as we expand our sales  marketing and administrative staff and add infrastructure 
as a result of the stock purchase agreement with the gamma trust in february  pursuant to which the gamma trust agreed to invest million into the company  we believe we have available liquidity sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operations and debt service for the next months 
our future cash requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the progress of our research and development of product candidates  possible acquisitions  the timing and outcome of clinical trials and regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the status of competitive products  our success in developing markets for our product candidates and the costs of any acquisitions we may undertake 
if we accelerate or delay our product development programs or initiate additional clinical trials  the timing of use of cash will increase or decrease accordingly 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs  and take other actions designed to reduce our cost of operations  all of which may not significantly extend the period of time that we will be able to continue operations without raising additional funding 
we intend to finance additional research and development projects  clinical trials and our future operations with a combination of private placements  payments from potential strategic research and development  licensing and or marketing arrangements  the issuance of debt or equity securities  debt financing and revenues from future product sales  if any

our ability to obtain additional capital may depend on prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
the current economic crisis and disruptions in the us and global financial markets may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit  as well as our ability to raise money in the capital markets 
current economic conditions have been  and continue to be volatile and  in recent months  the volatility has reached unprecedented levels 
continued instability in these market conditions may limit our ability to replace  in a timely manner  maturing liabilities and access the capital necessary to fund and grow our business 
there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
continued instability in these market conditions may limit our ability to replace  in a timely manner  maturing liabilities and access the capital necessary to fund and grow our business 

table of contents the following table provides information as of december  with respect to the amounts and timing of our known contractual obligation payments due by period 
contractual obligations after in thousands total open purchase orders operating leases credit line total the preceding table does not include information where the amounts of the obligations are not currently determinable  including contractual obligations in connection with clinical trials  which are payable on a per patient basis and product license agreements that include payments upon achievement of certain milestones 
in addition to the principal balance as shown on our credit line  we also must pay interest upon the maturity of the credit line in january critical accounting policies and estimates accounting estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
equity based compensation 
as of june  the date of inception  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
r 
share based payments sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb no 
sfas no 
r requires that all stock based compensation be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and that such cost be measured at the fair value of the award 
we adopted sfas no 
r upon our inception 
equity based compensation arrangements to non employees are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
r and emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  which requires that these equity instruments are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date 
as prescribed under sfas r  we estimate the grant date fair value of our stock option grants using a valuation model known as the black scholes merton formula or the black scholes model and allocate the resulting compensation expense over the corresponding requisite service period associated with each grant 
the black scholes model requires the use of several variables to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options including expected term  expected volatility  expected dividends and risk free interest rate 
we perform significant analyses to calculate and select the appropriate variable assumptions used in the black scholes model 
we also perform significant analyses to estimate forfeitures of equity based awards as required by sfas r 
we are required to adjust our forfeiture estimates on at least an annual basis based on the number of share based awards that ultimately vest 
the selection of assumptions and estimated forfeiture rates is subject to significant judgment and future changes to our assumptions and estimates may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
goodwill and intangible assets 
the allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values under the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 

additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets  because a portion of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business combination 

table of contents appraisals inherently require significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to  determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the in process r d projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows  and developing appropriate discount rates 
we believe the estimated fair values assigned to the acuity and oti assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
however  the fair value estimates for the purchase price allocation may change during the allowable allocation period under sfas no 
 which is up to one year from the acquisition date  if additional information becomes available that would require changes to our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue recognition 
generally  we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to our customers 
certain of our products are sold directly to end users and require that we deliver  install and train the staff at the end users facility 
as a result  we do not recognize revenue until the product is delivered  installed and training has occurred 
return policies in certain international markets for our medical device products provide for stringent guidelines in accordance with the terms of contractual agreements with customers 
our estimates for sales returns are based upon the historical patterns of products returned matched against the sales from which they originated  and management s evaluation of specific factors that may increase the risk of product returns 
during  four international customers represented approximately   and of our revenue  respectively 
as of december   open accounts receivable from two of our international distributors represented approximately and of our net accounts receivable balance 
the allowance for doubtful accounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at december  was million 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas  which gives companies the option to measure eligible financial assets  financial liabilities  and firm commitments at fair value ie  the fair value option  on an instrument by instrument basis  that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards 
the election to use the fair value option is available when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment 
subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we adopted sfas in the first quarter of and the adoption did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations as we elected not to apply fair value on an instrument by instrument basis 
in june  the emerging issues task force task force of the fasb reached a consensus on issue no 
eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
under eitf  nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
such payments should be recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed  not when the advance payment is made 
if a company does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered  the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense 
eitf is effective for new contracts entered into in fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is not permitted 
we have adopted eitf as of january  the adoption of eitf did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
sfas r will require  among other things  the expensing of direct transaction costs  including deal costs and restructuring costs as incurred  acquired in process research and development assets to be capitalized  certain contingent assets and liabilities to be recognized at fair value and earn our arrangements  including contingent consideration  may be required to be measured at fair value until settled  with changes in fair value recognized each period into earnings 
in addition  material adjustments made to the initial acquisition purchase accounting will be required to be recorded back to the acquisition date 
this will cause companies to revise previously reported results when reporting comparative financial information in subsequent filings 
sfas no 
r is effective for the company on a prospective basis for transactions occurring beginning on january  and earlier adoption is not permitted 
sfas no 
r may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows if we enter into material business combinations after january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
requires minority interests to be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and reported as a component of equity 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control be accounted for as equity transactions and  upon a loss of control  requires the interests sold  as well as any interests retained  to be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   with early adoption prohibited 
we do not expect a material impact on our financial statements from the adoption of this standard 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments or purchasing hedging instruments or other than trading instruments that are likely to expose us to significant market risk  whether interest rate  foreign currency exchange  commodity price  or equity price risk 
our exposure to market risk relates to our cash and investments and to our borrowings 
we maintain an investment portfolio of money market funds 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  and are  due to their very short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in market interest rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio except for reduced income in a low interest rate environment 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
the weighted average interest rate related to our cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  was 
as of december   the principal value of our term loan and credit line was million  which bears a weighted average interest rate of the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  bank obligations  repurchase agreements and high quality corporate issuers  and money market funds that invest in such debt instruments  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than one month
