item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a clinical stage biotechnology company organized as a delaware corporation in and engaged in the research and development of innovative cancer therapeutics directed toward molecular targets that we believe play critical roles in the development of human cancers 
our mission is to discover and develop novel products that target multiple tumor types  act selectively against cancer cells and are well tolerated by patients 
we believe our clinical stage products represent potential best in class or first in class small molecule candidates with differentiated mechanisms of action 
our products and research programs are based on our understanding of biological processes that lead to the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells  combined with our ability to generate product candidates possessing certain pre selected  drug like properties and designed to act with specificity against cancer cells 
we believe that these qualities  when present from the earliest stages of product development  increase the likelihood of producing safe  effective and marketable drugs 
we believe that our combined expertise in cancer biology and chemistry differentiates us from many companies at a similar stage of evolution 
our lead product is arq  an orally administered inhibitor of the c met receptor tyrosine kinase 
arq is currently being evaluated as monotherapy and in combination therapy in a phase clinical development program that includes trials in microphthalmia transcription factor mit associated tumors  non small cell lung cancer nsclc  pancreatic adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma hcc 
we have licensed commercial rights to arq for human cancer indications to daiichi sankyo co  ltd 
daiichi sankyo in the us  europe  south america and the rest of the world  excluding japan and certain other asian countries  where we have licensed commercial rights to kyowa hakko kirin co  ltd 
kyowa hakko kirin 
our separate agreements with these partners provide for possible future milestone payments  royalties on product sales  and development funding  in addition to payments that we have already received 
our product pipeline offers the potential for multiple therapeutic candidates based on diverse biological targets  mechanisms of action and chemistry 
the most advanced of these programs is focused on the development of inhibitors of the eg kinesin spindle protein  which include arq  for which we have filed an investigational new drug application ind 
we have completed certain phase proof of principle trials with arq  a first generation  intravenously administered novel activator of the cell s dna damage response mechanism mediated by the ef transcription factor  and we have filed an ind for arq  a second generation ef activator 
we are in pre clinical development with an inhibitor of the braf kinase 
our drug discovery efforts are focused primarily on the arqule kinase inhibitor platform akip  which we employ to generate a new class of compounds designed to inhibit a variety of kinases potently  selectively and without competing with adenosine triphosphate atp  an energy source for cells 
we are currently assessing the potential of multiple kinases in oncology and other therapeutic areas as targets for this drug discovery platform  and we are seeking to generate and validate compounds that inhibit these kinase targets 
we have signed a drug discovery agreement with daiichi sankyo that leverages the capabilities of the akip platform to discover compounds that inhibit two such kinase targets in the field of oncology 
all of our drug discovery efforts  including our kinase platform  are supported by the expertise we have derived from our heritage as a combinatorial chemistry company 
this expertise  which has been validated through collaborations with pfizer  wyeth  solvay and other corporate partners  is married to state of the art biology to create a discovery engine marked by speed  efficiency and flexibility 
in september  we announced a strategic decision to exit our pre existing chemistry services operations in order to focus operationally on developing our oncology portfolio 
revenue from our 
table of contents chemistry services operations terminated in as a result of our strategic decision to no longer provide these services and the subsequent decision by pfizer to terminate its collaborative agreement agreement with us effective may  we did not incur any financial penalty as a result of termination 
we continued to provide chemistry services to pfizer pursuant to the agreement through the effective date of termination 
since december  we produced for pfizer annually an average of approximately  synthetic chemical compounds and received average annual cash payments of approximately million for those compounds and related services 
the agreement provided for six months prior written notice by either party to the other for termination without cause and  in the event of termination by pfizer  certain payments to us 
in accordance with these provisions  we received approximately million in december in connection with the termination 
we considered the chemistry services asset group to be a component of an entity  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  since it comprised operations and cash flows that were clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the remainder of the company s operations 
pursuant to sfas  we reported the results of the chemistry services component as discontinued operations in the year ended december   since their related cash flows were eliminated from our ongoing operations and we did not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component or the assets that were disposed 
we have incurred a cumulative net loss of million from inception through december  we expect research and development costs to increase in  due to clinical testing of our lead product candidates 
although we have generated positive cash flow from operations for six consecutive years from  these cash flows were attributable to our discontinued chemistry services operations 
we recorded a net loss for all but one of those years 
we recorded a net loss for  and  and expect a net loss for our revenue consists primarily of development funding from our alliances with roche  daiichi sankyo and kyowa hakko kirin 
revenue and expenses fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon a number of factors  notably the timing and extent of our cancer related research and development activities together with the length and outcome of our clinical trials 
on december   roche notified the company of its intention not to exercise its option to license the ef program 
roche s rights to develop and commercialize potential drugs under the agreement terminated as of december  as a result  the company will not receive any further payments under this agreement 
on december   we entered into a license  co development and co commercialization agreement with daiichi sankyo to conduct research  clinical trials and the market launch of arq in human cancer indications in the us  europe  south america and the rest of the world  excluding japan  china including hong kong  south korea and taiwan  where kyowa hakko kirin has exclusive rights for development and commercialization 
the agreement provides for a million cash upfront licensing payment from daiichi sankyo to us  which we received in december and an additional million in potential development and sales milestone payments 
we and daiichi sankyo will share equally the costs of phase and phase clinical studies  with our share of phase costs payable solely from milestone and royalty payments by daiichi sankyo 
upon commercialization  we will receive tiered  double digit royalties from daiichi sankyo on net sales of arq commensurate with the magnitude of the transaction 
we retain the option to participate in the commercialization of arq in the us revenue for this agreement is recognized using the contingency adjusted performance model with an estimated development period through december for the year ended december   million was recognized as revenue 
at december   million remains in deferred revenue 

table of contents the duration and termination of the agreement is tied to future events 
unless earlier terminated due to breach  insolvency or upon days notice if prior to phase clinical trials or days notice if on or after the beginning of phase clinical trials by daiichi  the agreement shall continue until the later of i such time as daiichi is no longer developing at least one licensed product or ii if daiichi has commercialized a licensed product or products  such time as all royalty terms for all licensed products have ended

on april   we entered into an exclusive license agreement with kyowa hakko kirin to develop and commercialize arq  a small molecule  selective inhibitor of the c met receptor tyrosine kinase  in japan and parts of asia 
a million portion of an upfront licensing fee was received by the company under this agreement in the first quarter of and an additional million in upfront licensing fees was received on may  the agreement includes million in upfront and potential development milestone payments from kyowa hakko kirin to arqule  including the million cash upfront licensing payments 
in february  we received a million milestone payment from kyowa hakko kirin 
upon commercialization  arqule will receive tiered royalties in the mid teen to low twenty percent range from kyowa hakko kirin on net sales of arq kyowa hakko kirin will be responsible for all clinical development costs and commercialization of the compound in certain asian countries  consisting of japan  china including hong kong  south korea and taiwan 
in addition to the upfront and possible regulatory milestone payments totaling million  the company will be eligible for future milestone payments based on the achievement of certain levels of net sales 
the company will recognize the payments  if any  as revenue in accordance with its revenue recognition policies 
as of december   the company has not recognized any revenue from these sales milestone payments  and there can be no assurance that it will do so in the future 

table of contents the duration and termination of the agreement is tied to future events

on april   we announced an alliance with hoffmann la roche roche to discover and develop drug candidates targeting the ef biological pathway  including arq  and arq under the terms of the agreement  roche obtained an option to license drugs resulting from our ef program in the field of cancer therapy and provided immediate research funding of million and financial support for ongoing research and development 
roche had an option to license from us worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of all products resulting from the ef program in the field of cancer therapy based on our delivery of a clinical data package from certain trials with arq  as well as a recommended phase dose for a second generation ef compound 
on december   roche notified the company of its intention not to exercise its option to license the ef program 
roche s rights to develop and commercialize potential drugs under the agreement terminated as of december  as a result  the company will not receive any further payments under this agreement 
on january   the company notified roche that  in accordance with the terms of the agreement  it had exercised its right to terminate the agreement 
as a result  all rights and licenses granted by the company to roche under the agreement will also be terminated 
under this agreement we received approximately million in research and development support from roche  all of which has been recognized as revenue through december  in the year ended december   we recognized revenue from roche of approximately million  including million of deferred revenue upon the termination of the roche alliance agreement in revenue of approximately million was recognized in each of the years ended december  and no further revenues will be recognized under the collaboration with roche 
liquidity and capital resources december  increase decrease to to in millions cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities short term marketable securities long term notes payable working capital in millions cash flow from operating activities investing activities financing activities 
table of contents cash flow from operating activities 
our uses of cash for operating activities have primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our offices and laboratories  fees paid in connection with preclinical and clinical studies  laboratory supplies and materials  and professional fees 
the sources of our cash flow from operating activities have consisted primarily of payments from our collaborators for services performed or upfront payments for future services 
in  our net source of cash was primarily driven by the difference between cash receipts from our collaborators  and payments for operating expenses which resulted in a net cash inflow of million 
cash flow from investing activities 
our net cash provided by investing activities of million in was comprised of net sales of marketable securities of million  partially offset by acquisitions of fixed assets of million 
the composition and mix of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities may change frequently as a result of the company s constant evaluation of conditions in financial markets  the maturity of specific investments  and our near term liquidity needs 
our cash equivalents and marketable securities include us treasury bill funds  money market funds and us federal and state agency backed certificates  including auction rate securities that have investment grade ratings 
our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
auction rate securities are structured with short term interest reset dates of generally less than days  but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years 
at the end of each reset period  which occurs every seven to twenty eight days  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par value 
if any of our auction rate securities were to fail an auction  due to sell orders exceeding buy orders  the funds associated with a failed auction would not be accessible until a successful auction occurred  a buyer was found outside the auction process  the underlying securities matured or a settlement with the underwriter is reached 
beginning in the first quarter of and throughout  certain auction rate securities failed auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
on november   the company accepted an offer the offering by ubs ag ubs of certain rights put option to cause ubs to purchase auction rate securities owned by the company 
the repurchase rights were offered in connection with ubs ag s obligations under settlement agreements with the us securities and exchange commission and other federal and state regulatory authorities 
the offering  the settlement agreements  and the respective rights and obligations of the parties  including a release by the company of ubs and its employees and agents from all claims except claims for consequential damages relating to ubs s marketing and sale of auction rate securities  are described in a prospectus issued by ubs dated october  as a result of accepting the offering  the company received a put option from ubs to repurchase the securities at par value at any time during the period from june  through july   if the company s auction rate securities have not previously been sold by the company or by ubs on its behalf 
the company has accounted for the put option as a freestanding financial instrument and elected to record the value under the fair value option of sfas no 
as a result  million was recorded to other income which represents the fair value of the put option during the year ended december  simultaneously  the company  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  transferred these auction rate securities from available for sale to trading securities 
the transfer to trading securities reflects the company s intent 
table of contents to exercise the put option during the period june  to july  as a result of our intention to exercise the put option  we no longer demonstrate the ability and intent to hold our auction rate securities and recorded an other than temporary impairment totaling million which was recorded in other income expense in the statement of operations in the year ended december  arqule s marketable securities portfolio as of december  was million 
the portfolio included million at cost invested in auction rate securities of which  million at cost were associated with auctions that failed subsequent to february  in the year ended december   arqule sold million at cost of auction rate securities that were held at december  arqule s marketable securities portfolio as of december  was million at cost invested in auction rate securities all of which were associated with auctions that failed subsequent to february  on july   we entered into a collateralized  revolving credit line agreement for up to million with ubs bank usa the facility 
the facility is secured by a first priority lien and security interest in the auction rate securities held by us in an account with ubs financial services inc  an affiliate of ubs bank usa 
the credit line is uncommitted and any outstanding balance  including interest  is payable upon demand 
variable rate advances under the facility currently bear interest at libor plus basis points and interest will be payable monthly 
the facility replaced the million standard margin loan agreement with ubs financial services inc that we entered into on may  in july  we drew down million under the facility 
the funds will be available for research and development efforts  including clinical trials  and for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
in accordance with the offering by ubs  the million borrowed under the facility remains payable on demand  however  if ubs bank usa should exercise its right to demand repayment of any portion of the company s indebtedness prior to the date the company can exercise its repurchase rights other than for reasons specified in the prospectus  ubs and certain of its affiliates will arrange for alternative financing on terms and conditions substantially the same as those contained in the facility 
if alternative financing cannot be established  then ubs or one of its affiliates will purchase the company s pledged auction rate securities at par 
we believe these terms represent a positive step toward the resolution of the illiquidity of our auction rate securities investments 
given these terms  and taking into account the financial impact of our two agreements with daiichi sankyo  including a cumulative million in cash and upfront payments and certain anticipated milestone and cost sharing provisions  we expect that our available cash and cash equivalents  including cash received under our auction rate security credit line agreement as described above  together with cash from operations and investment income  will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital requirements through at least the end of cash flow from financing activities 
our net cash provided by financing activities of million in the year ended december  was primarily from the million we borrowed under our collateralized  revolving credit line agreement as described above and the million we borrowed under a margin loan agreement with another financial institution collateralized by million of our auction rate securities 
our net cash provided by financing activities of million in the year ended december  was comprised primarily of the proceeds from our june stock offering  wherein we sold million shares of common stock at per share for aggregate net proceeds of million after commissions and offering expenses 
during july  the company received net proceeds of million when the underwriters exercised a portion of their over allotment option and purchased an additional  shares of common stock 
stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases provided additional cash inflow of million 

table of contents our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending upon the results of our drug discovery and development strategies  our ability to enter into additional corporate collaborations and the terms of such collaborations  results of research and development  unanticipated required capital expenditures  competitive and technological advances  acquisitions and other factors 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to develop any of our drug candidates into a commercial product 
it is likely we will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to continue to fund our operations in the future 
our ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial  economic and market conditions and due to global capital and credit market conditions or for other reasons  we may be unable to raise capital when needed  or on terms favorable to us 
if necessary funds are not available  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate some of our development programs  potentially delaying the time to market for any of our product candidates 
our contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december  in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years notes payable operating lease obligations purchase obligations total included in the total minimum payments for operating leases is approximately related to abandoned real estate in california  net of contractual sublease income 
this net amount has been accrued as a liability as a part of the company s restructuring charge in and subsequently adjusted in and purchase obligations are comprised primarily of outsourced preclinical and clinical trial expenses and payments to license certain intellectual property to support the company s research efforts 
interest on notes payable is variable and is excluded from the table above 
notes payable of million currently bear interest at a rate not to exceed our weighted average auction rate security coupon rate and million currently bear interest at libor plus basis points 
discontinued operations on september   we announced our intention to exit our chemistry services operations 
we received notice on december  that pfizer had elected to terminate our collaboration agreement the agreement  pursuant to its terms  effective may  the agreement provided for six months prior written notice by either party to the other for termination without cause and  in the event of termination by pfizer  certain payments to us 
in accordance with these provisions  we received approximately million in december in connection with the termination 
this amount was recorded as deferred revenue and was recognized as revenue when compounds were delivered through the termination date 
we have fulfilled our compound production obligations under the agreement  recognized the remaining deferred revenue  and ceased chemistry services operations in the net book value of the assets associated with the chemistry services operations  which totaled million  approximated the fair market value of the underlying assets 
in december  we completed the sale of the chemistry services assets  which consisted of commercially available laboratory instrumentation  for approximately million  net of disposal costs 
we considered the chemistry services asset group to be a component of an entity as defined in sfas since it comprised operations and cash flows that were clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the remainder of the company s operations 
pursuant to sfas  we reported the results of the chemistry services component as discontinued operations in

table of contents funding for research and development  milestone payments and royalties on any product sales derived from collaborations 
research and development payments from our collaborators are recognized as research and development revenue using the contingency adjusted performance model 
under this model  when payments are earned  revenue is immediately recognized on a pro rata basis in the period we achieve the milestone based on the time elapsed from inception of the agreement to the time the milestone is earned over the estimated duration of the development period under the agreement 
thereafter  the remaining portion of the milestone payment is recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated development period under the agreement 
this estimated development period may ultimately be shorter or longer depending upon the outcome of the development work  resulting in accelerated or deferred recognition of the development revenue 
royalty payments will be recognized as revenue when earned 
the costs associated with satisfying research and development contracts are included in research and development expense as incurred 
restructuring charges credits accruals for abandoned facilities under lease require significant management judgment and the use of estimates  including assumptions concerning the ability of a sublessee to fulfill its contractual sublease obligations 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a sublease for the company s abandoned facility in redwood city  california 
the term of the sublease extends through  the remaining term of the company s primary lease 
as a result of signing the sublease  we adjusted our accrual for abandoned facilities to reflect the full amount of the anticipated sublease income to be received 
this assumption about the subleasee s ability to fulfill its contractual obligation is based on an analysis of their financial position and ability to generate future working capital 
if the subleasee is unable to meet its obligations  and the company is unable to enter into another sublease for the facility  arqule may be required to adjust its restructuring accrual and record additional restructuring expense of up to million 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we assess our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances a triggering event indicate that the carrying value of a group of long lived assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas on september   we announced our intention to exit our chemistry services operations when we had completed our existing agreement with pfizer in we concluded that our intention to exit our chemistry services operations was a triggering event and that an impairment review was required 
as a result of that review  we determined that the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from our chemistry services operations exceeded the net carrying value of the group of long lived assets attributed to those operations  and therefore there was no impairment in the quarter ended september  on december   we received notice that pfizer had elected to terminate the agreement  pursuant to the agreement s terms  effective may  we concluded that notification from pfizer was also a triggering event and performed a second impairment review 
as a result of this second review  we again determined that the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from our chemistry services operations exceeded the net carrying value of the group of long lived assets attributed to those operations  and therefore there was no impairment in the quarter ended december  based on our decision to exit our chemistry services operations  in we adjusted the depreciable lives on fixed assets used exclusively in those operations in order to fully depreciate the remaining book value of those assets over the remaining period that we will provide services to pfizer 

table of contents we were contractually required to perform under the terms of the agreement until may  and  as such  the assets of the chemistry services operations were considered held for use at december  although we were actively seeking a potential buyer for the chemistry services operations  the uncertainty of us successfully completing a sale transaction within one year  or deciding to abandon the assets  precluded us from classifying the assets of the chemistry services operations as assets to be disposed of by sale at december  in the third quarter ended september   it became probable that we would sell the chemistry services operations  eliminate the associated cash flows  and have no continuing involvement in the chemistry services operations 
accordingly  the chemistry services operations was reported as discontinued operations in our statements of operations in accordance with sfas the net book value of the assets associated with the chemistry services operations  which totaled million  approximated the fair market value of the underlying assets 
in december  management completed the sale of the chemistry services assets  which consisted of commercially available laboratory instrumentation  for approximately million  net of direct costs to sell such assets 
sale leaseback accounting on may   we completed a transaction to sell our woburn headquarters facility and two parcels of land in exchange for a cash payment of million  net of commissions and closing costs 
simultaneously with that sale  we entered into an agreement to lease back the entire facility and the associated land 
the lease was subsequently amended on june  the amended lease has a term of ten years with an average annual rental rate of million 
we also have options to extend the lease term for up to an additional ten years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  we are applying sale leaseback accounting to the transaction and are treating the lease as an operating lease 
as a result of this transaction  we reduced our net fixed assets by million  representing the net book value of the assets sold on the date of the lease amendment  and realized a gain on the sale of million  which has been deferred and will be amortized over the initial ten year lease term as a reduction in rent expense

table of contents research and development increase decrease to to in millions research and development overview our research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of facilities and equipment  fees paid to professional service providers in connection with our clinical trials  fees paid to research organizations in connection with preclinical animal studies  costs of materials used in research and development  consulting  license  and sponsored research fees paid to third parties and depreciation of associated laboratory equipment 
we expect our research and development expense to increase as we continue to develop our portfolio of oncology programs 
we have not accumulated and tracked our internal historical research and development costs or our personnel and personnel related costs on a program by program basis 
our employee and infrastructure resources are allocated across several projects  and many of our costs are directed to broadly applicable research endeavors 
as a result  we cannot state the costs incurred for each of our oncology programs on a program by program basis  or the cost to support our alliance agreement with roche 
the expenses incurred by us to third parties for preclinical and clinical trials in and since inception of each program were as follows in millions oncology program current status program to date ef modulation arq phase ef modulation arq phase cmet inhibition arq phase our future research and development expenses in support of our current and future oncology programs will be subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
we test potential products in numerous preclinical studies for safety  toxicology  and efficacy 
we then may conduct multiple clinical trials for each product 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty  and intended use of a product 
it is not unusual for the preclinical and clinical development of these types of products to each take nine years or more  and for total development costs to exceed million for each product 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type generally needed to secure new drug approval are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion period phase years phase years phase years the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development  including  among others  the following the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  
table of contents the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials  the duration of patient follow up to ensure the absence of long term adverse safety events  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product 
an element of our business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a broad pipeline of products 
this is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures 
to the extent we are unable to maintain a broad pipeline of products  our dependence on the success of one or a few products increases 
our strategy includes entering into alliance arrangements with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of our products  such as our collaboration agreements with daiichi and kyowa hakko kirin 
in the event that third parties have control over the clinical trial process for a product  the estimated completion date would largely be under control of that third party rather than under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether our products will be subject to future collaborative arrangements or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our oncology programs or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
our inability to complete our oncology programs in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business
