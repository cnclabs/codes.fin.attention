in local currency  the europe and asia pacific segments experienced increases of and  respectively  in sales of homecare and cleaning products 
in fiscal year  we continued to face a challenging cost environment  largely driven by cost pressures related to components and raw materials 
in response to the rise in costs  we implemented worldwide sales price increases on certain products and aggressively managed costs through a wide range of cost savings projects  including our sourcing and supply chain activities  which include more efficient sourcing of raw materials and transportation costs 
in addition to price increases  we continue to address the rising costs through innovation and margin enhancement strategies 
we increased our gross profit as a percentage of net sales to for fiscal year from for fiscal year  primarily due to the impact of worldwide sales price increases implemented on certain products during fiscal year during fiscal year  we recorded impairment charges of million on indefinite lived intangible assets related to our carpet fresh and x trade names 
these impairment charges were triggered by the declines in profit margins and forecasted sales revenue for the carpet fresh and x brands resulting primarily from lost distribution in the us and our strategic decision to divert our research and development resources from our homecare and cleaning products to our multi purpose maintenance products

the sales growth in the uk was due to increased sales across all brands  which include wd  in one and  due to the timing of promotional activities

in addition  both the uk and france benefitted from new distribution gained during fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
however  the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates year over year more than offset the sales growth in local currencies in the uk and france

thus  on a constant currency basis  sales would have decreased by million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
sales in asia  which represented of total sales in the asia pacific segment  decreased for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to lower sales of multi purpose maintenance products across most of the asia region  including china  indonesia  singapore  malaysia and taiwan 
sales in china decreased by million  or  representing of the total decrease in the asia region  while sales across the rest of the asia region decreased 
although china and many of the markets throughout the asia region experienced strong sales during the first quarter of fiscal year  they were unable to fully recover from the sales declines experienced during the remainder of the fiscal year due to the negative impact of general economic conditions

gross profit gross profit was million  or of net sales  for fiscal year  compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal year the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was due to worldwide sales price increases implemented during the first quarter of fiscal year  partially offset by higher costs of products  the timing of advertising  promotional  and other discounts  and the closeout of slow moving inventory during fiscal year to combat the higher costs of products  we implemented worldwide sales price increases on certain products which added approximately percentage points to our gross profit percentage for fiscal year the increase in cost of products  which had a negative impact on gross profit percentage of percentage points  was due primarily to the increase in costs for components and raw materials  including aerosol cans  during the fiscal year ended august  the higher costs for aerosol cans negatively impacted our gross profit percentage by percentage points for the fiscal year ended august  we began to experience a 
table of contents significant increase in the cost of aerosol cans during the second quarter of fiscal year primarily due to the cost of tinplate used to manufacture such cans 
tinplate pricing is set annually and is independent of the movements in the cost of steel on the spot market 
while the cost of steel on the spot market has experienced recent declines  the cost of aerosol cans has not benefited from this recent trend 
partially offsetting these cost increases were the lower costs for petroleum based products  which positively impacted our gross profit percentage by percentage points 
in addition  changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the europe segment negatively impacted our gross profit percentage by percentage points  while cost benefits related to product conversions and sourcing changes in the us during last fiscal year s fourth quarter positively impacted gross profit percentage by percentage points during the fiscal year ended august  in general  shifts in product and customer mix  as well as the timing of advertising  promotional and other discounts  which are recorded as a reduction to sales  may cause fluctuations in gross profit percentage from period to period 
such shift in product and customer mix negatively impacted our gross profit percentage by percentage points for the fiscal year ended august  examples of advertising  promotional and other discounts include coupon redemptions  consideration and allowances given to retailers for space and or favorable display positions in their stores  co operative advertising and promotional activity  volume discounts and other one time or ongoing incentives 
during the fiscal year ended august   advertising  promotional and other discounts increased compared to the prior fiscal year  negatively impacting gross profit percentage by percentage points 
the increase in such discounts was due to the fact that a greater percentage of sales during fiscal year was subject to promotional allowances in response to general economic conditions 
also negatively impacting our gross profit percentage for the fiscal year ended august  was the closeout of slow moving inventory  which had a negative impact on gross profit percentage of percentage points 
note that our gross profits may not be comparable to those of other reporting entities  since some entities include all costs related to distribution of their products in cost of products sold  whereas we exclude the portion associated with amounts paid to third parties for distribution to our customers from our contract manufacturers and include these costs in selling  general and administrative expenses 
these costs totaled million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the fiscal year ended august  decreased to million from million for the prior fiscal year 
however  as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased to for the fiscal year ended august  from for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in sg a expenses was largely attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation and to lower freight costs 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior fiscal year decreased sg a expenses by million for the fiscal year ended august  thus  on a constant currency basis  sg a expenses for the fiscal year ended august  would have been million for an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
freight costs decreased million due to reduced fuel costs  improved shipping efficiencies and lower sales revenue 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases in employee related costs  research and development costs and other miscellaneous expenses 
employee related costs  which include salaries  bonuses  profit sharing and other fringe benefits  increased million due to annual compensation increases and higher staffing levels primarily to support the growth of international operations 
research and development costs increased million due to the timing of new product development activity 
other miscellaneous expenses  including stock based compensation  professional services costs and bad debt expense  increased by million 
we continued our research and development investment in support of our focus on innovation and renovation 
research and development costs were million for the fiscal year ended august   compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase was due to our increased investment in research and development in support of our strategic initiative to maximize our position in the multi purpose maintenance products segment by diverting our research and development resources from our homecare and cleaning products to our multi

advertising and sales promotion expenses advertising and sales promotion expenses decreased to million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
however  as a percentage of net sales  such expenses increased to for the fiscal year ended august  from for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in these expenses was due to the timing of investment in advertising activities  partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates year over year 
on a constant currency basis  advertising and sales promotion expenses for the fiscal year ended august  would have been million for an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
investment in global advertising and sales promotion expenses for fiscal year is expected to be in the range of to of net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  advertising and sales promotion expenses may fluctuate period to period based upon the type of marketing activities employed by the company and the period in which the costs are incurred 
the costs of certain promotional activities are required to be recorded as reductions to sales  while others remain in advertising and sales promotion expenses 
for the fiscal year ended august   total promotional costs recorded as a reduction to sales were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
therefore  our total investment in advertising and sales promotion activities totaled million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
amortization of definite lived intangible asset expense amortization of our definite lived intangible asset was million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the amortization relates to the non contractual customer relationships acquired in the acquisition completed by the europe segment in fiscal year this intangible asset is recorded and amortized in pound sterling on a straight line basis over its estimated eight year life and is converted to us dollars for reporting purposes 
therefore  any fluctuations in amortization from period to period are the result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets expense during the second quarter of fiscal year  we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

based on the results of this test  we determined that our goodwill was not impaired since the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
we also determined that each of the indefinite lived intangible assets related to our homecare and cleaning product brands  with the exception of the indefinite lived intangible asset related to the carpet fresh brand  was not impaired as of february  due to the declines in profit margin and forecasted sales revenue for the carpet fresh brand  both of which occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year  we concluded that the carpet fresh trade name was impaired by million as of february  the decline in forecasted sales revenue for the carpet fresh brand resulted from our strategic decision to divert our research and development resources from our homecare and cleaning products to our multi purpose maintenance products  the loss of distribution with a significant us mass retail customer and assumed lower future foreign currency exchange rates in the uk and australia 
while some of these factors also impacted the indefinite lived intangible assets related to our other homecare and cleaning product brands  they did not result in impairment to any of such other indefinite lived intangible assets as of february  during the third quarter of fiscal year  we evaluated our indefinite lived intangible assets and determined that indicators of potential impairment existed due to the fact that actual sales revenue for the carpet fresh  x  
table of contents flushes and spot shot brands did not meet our forecasted sales revenue for the quarter ended may   partially due to adverse economic conditions 
as a result  we tested these indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment and concluded that no impairment existed as of may  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we reevaluated our indefinite lived intangible assets and determined that indicators of potential impairment existed related to the carpet fresh and x brands due to a further decline in forecasted sales revenue as a result of additional lost distribution in the us and further diversion of research and development resources from our homecare and cleaning products to our multi purpose maintenance products 
as a result  we tested the indefinite lived intangible assets related to the carpet fresh and x trade names for impairment and concluded that they were impaired by million and million  respectively  as of august  we determined that no indicators of impairment existed related to the spot shot and flushes brands as of august  however  if significant marketing and other initiatives related to these brands are not successful  they could potentially become impaired

partially offsetting the lower interest income was a decrease in interest expense due to the lower principal balance on long term borrowings resulting from the annual million principal payments made in october and other income  net other income  net decreased by million for fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year due primarily to foreign currency exchange losses in the europe segment 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was of income before income taxes for fiscal year  a decrease from for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a california tax law enacted during the second quarter of fiscal year the change resulted in the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the law s effective date 
the rate also decreased due to the impact of increasing income from foreign operations taxed at lower rates  benefits associated with the payout of a retired officer s life insurance policy  and the renewal of the research and development credit for the prior fiscal year s activities

thus  on a constant currency basis  sales would have decreased by million  or  for fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales of multi purpose maintenance products in the americas were essentially flat for fiscal year compared to fiscal year due partially to decreased wd sales in the us  where sales declined by 
wd sales in the us declined as customers reduced inventory levels and in store promotional activities in response to the slowing us economy 
in addition  due to supply constraints related to the distribution of the wd smart straw  promotional activities associated with the company s conversion to the smart straw format scheduled for late fiscal year were delayed until fiscal year the decrease in wd sales in the us was offset by increased wd sales in latin america and canada of and  respectively 
growth in latin america was primarily due to new distribution and increased promotional activity  while growth in canada was due to increased promotional activity during fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales of homecare and cleaning products in the americas for fiscal year were down million  or  compared to fiscal year due primarily to declines in the us where sales decreased across all homecare and cleaning product brands

table of contents gross profit gross profit was million  or of net sales  for fiscal year  compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased by percentage points as we continued to experience increases in costs of products sold  which negatively affected gross margins in all of our regions 
the rise in costs of products was due to the significant increase in costs for components and raw materials  including aerosol cans and petroleum based products 
losses associated with vml company llc vml  a former related party contract manufacturer  also negatively impacted gross profit

net income net income was million  or per common share on a fully diluted basis  for fiscal year  compared to million  or per common share on a fully diluted basis  for fiscal year the change in foreign currency exchange rates year over year had a positive impact of million on net income for fiscal year thus  on a constant currency basis  net income for fiscal year would have decreased by million  or  for fiscal year compared to fiscal year liquidity and capital resources overview the company s financial condition and liquidity remain strong 
net cash provided by operations was million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to million for the fiscal year ended august  despite the recent liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets  we believe we are well positioned to weather the uncertainty due to our strong balance sheet and efficient business model  along with our growing and diversified global revenues

table of contents on march   the company s board of directors approved a share buy back plan 
as a result of the share buy back plan  the company s debt covenants related to its fixed rate term loan were revised 
under the revised debt covenants  the aggregate payments for dividends and share repurchases by the company are limited to million  plus of consolidated net income for each quarter beginning march  cash flows operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased to million for fiscal year from million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase was due to the increase in net income as adjusted for noncash items such as depreciation and amortization  impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets and stock based compensation  and the cash impact of changes in working capital 
investing activities during fiscal year  our cash outflows from investing activities were for capital expenditures  while our cash inflows were proceeds from the sales of property and equipment 
capital expenditures during fiscal year were primarily for machinery and equipment to enhance manufacturing efficiencies  computer equipment  software and vehicles

current liabilities were million at august   down million from million at august  accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by million due to the timing of payments 
accrued payroll and related expenses increased million primarily due to the increase in the bonus accrual since many regions achieved higher profit and other performance metrics for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year

dividends on october   the company s board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share payable on october  to shareholders of record on october  our ability to pay dividends could be affected by future business performance  liquidity  capital needs  alternative investment opportunities and loan covenants 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of minimum contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations and commitments as of august  for the next five years and thereafter in thousands 
future events could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts 
total year years years thereafter total debt interest payments on debt operating leases the following summarizes other commercial commitments as of august  the company has relationships with various suppliers  or contract manufacturers  who manufacture the company s products 
although the company does not have any definitive minimum purchase obligations included in the contract terms with contract manufacturers  supply needs are communicated and the company is committed to purchase the products produced based on sales forecasts provided to the contract manufacturers  ranging from two to five months 
the company is also obligated to purchase obsolete or slow moving inventory 
in addition to the commitments to purchase products from contract manufacturers described above  the company may also enter into commitments with other manufacturers to purchase finished goods and components to support innovation initiatives and or supply chain initiatives 
as of august   such commitments totaled million 
the company provides fixed retirement benefits to certain of its key executives under a supplemental employee retirement plan 
under the plan  the company is committed to pay benefits to current retirees of approximately million in each of fiscal years through benefits payable to current employees vest upon retirement 
as a result  the timing of payments and the total annual benefit payment amounts beyond fiscal year are uncertain 
however  the company has actuarially determined the present value of all future benefit payments to be million as of august  at august   the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions  excluding associated interest and penalties  was approximately million pursuant to fin we have estimated that up to million of unrecognized tax benefits related to income tax positions may be affected by the resolution of tax examinations or expiring statutes of limitation within the next twelve months 
since the ultimate amount and timing of other potential audit related cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty  liabilities for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the contractual obligations table above

critical accounting policies the company s results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
management uses historical experience and other relevant factors when developing estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated 
note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report includes a discussion of significant accounting policies 
the accounting policies discussed below are the ones management considers critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment 
the company s financial results may have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 
the company s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition sales are recognized as revenue at the time of delivery to the customer when risks of loss and title pass 
management must make judgments and certain assumptions in the determination of when delivery occurs 
through an analysis of end of period shipments  the company determines an average time of transit that is used to estimate the time of delivery 
differences in judgments or estimates  such as the lengthening or shortening of the estimated delivery time used  could result in material differences in the timing of revenue recognition 
sales are recorded net of allowances for damaged goods and other sales returns  sales incentives  trade promotions and cash discounts 
accounting for sales incentives the company records sales incentives as a reduction of sales in its consolidated statements of operations 
the company offers on going trade promotion programs with customers  and consumer coupon programs that require the company to estimate and accrue the expected costs of such programs 
programs include cooperative marketing programs  shelf price reductions  coupons  rebates  consideration and allowances given to retailers for 
table of contents space and or favorable display positions in their stores and other promotional activity 
costs related to rebates  co operative advertising and other promotional activity are recorded upon delivery of products to customers 
costs related to coupon offers are based upon historical redemption rates and are recorded as incurred  when coupons are circulated 
estimated sales incentives are calculated and recorded at the time related sales are made and are based primarily on historical rates and consideration of recent promotional activities 
the determination of sales incentive liabilities requires the company to use judgment for estimates that include current and past trade promotion spending patterns  status of trade promotional activities and the interpretation of historical spending trends by customer and category 
we review our assumptions and adjust our reserves quarterly 
our financial statements could be materially impacted if the actual promotion rates fluctuate from the estimated rate 
if the company s accrual estimates for sales incentives at august  were to differ by  the impact on net sales would be approximately million 
allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounting for income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax liability or asset is established for the expected future tax consequences resulting from the differences in financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in addition to valuation allowances  the company provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards prescribed by fin amounts for uncertain tax positions are adjusted in periods when new information becomes available or when positions are effectively settled 
in accordance with fin  the company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense

valuation of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the carrying values of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
we assess possible impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets at least annually during our second fiscal quarter and otherwise when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment condition may exist 
in addition  indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
the company tests for goodwill impairment based on the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model which is a two step process 
first  the book value of the company s net assets is compared to the fair value of the net assets 
table of contents of the reporting units that have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment 
in the second step  the implied fair value of goodwill is estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step less the fair values of all other net tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
any required impairment losses are recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount of the related asset and charged to results of operations 
the company tests for impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives based on a discounted cash flows approach that requires significant management judgment and estimates with respect to  among other considerations  forecasted sales revenue  advertising and promotional expenses  cost of products sold  gross margins  operating margins  the success of product innovations and introductions  customer retention  tax rates  terminal growth values and the selection of appropriate discount and royalty rates 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods 
these changes could result in future impairments 
for its indefinite lived intangible assets  an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount and is measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
events and circumstances that we consider important which could trigger impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the company s strategy for its overall business or use of the acquired assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  decreased market capitalization relative to net book value  unanticipated technological change or competitive activities  loss of key distribution  change in consumer demand  loss of key personnel  and acts by governments and courts 
when there is indication that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
when there is an indication of impairment of goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
based on the results of this test  we determined that our goodwill was not impaired since the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than as of february  we also determined that each of the indefinite lived intangible assets related to our homecare and cleaning products  with the exception of the carpet fresh brand  was not impaired as of february  due to the declines in profit margin and forecasted sales revenue for the carpet fresh brand  both of which occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year  we concluded that the 
table of contents carpet fresh trade name was impaired by million as of february  the decline in forecasted sales revenue resulted from our strategic decision to divert our research and development resources from our homecare and cleaning products to our multi purpose maintenance products  the loss of distribution with a significant us mass retail customer and assumed lower future foreign currency exchange rates in the uk and australia 
while some of these factors also impacted the indefinite lived intangible assets related to our other homecare and cleaning products  they did not result in impairment to any of such other indefinite lived intangible assets as of february  during the third quarter of fiscal year  we evaluated our indefinite lived intangible assets and determined that indicators of potential impairment existed due to the fact that actual sales revenue for the carpet fresh  x  spot shot and flushes brands did not meet our forecasted sales revenue for the quarter ended may   partially due to adverse economic conditions 
as a result  we tested these indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment and concluded that no impairment existed as of may  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we reevaluated our indefinite lived intangible assets and determined that indicators of potential impairment existed related to the carpet fresh and x brands due to a further decline in forecasted sales revenue as a result of additional lost distribution in the us and further diversion of research and development resources from our homecare and cleaning products to our multi purpose maintenance products 
as a result  we tested the indefinite lived intangible assets related to the carpet fresh and x trade names for impairment and concluded that they were impaired by million and million  respectively  as of august  as a result  the remaining carrying amounts of the carpet fresh and x trade names were million and million  respectively  as of august  as a result of lost distribution and our strategic decision to divert research and development resources from our carpet fresh and x brands  forecasted sales revenue for these brands have declined 
as a result  we concluded that the carpet fresh and x trade names should no longer be considered to have indefinite lives 
we determined the estimated remaining economic lives of the carpet fresh and x trade names based on future forecasted cash flows for the brands 
we expect that the carpet fresh and x brands will generate cash flows for at least the next years and years  respectively  which are the periods over which these trade names will be amortized on a straight line basis beginning in fiscal year we determined that no indicators of impairment existed related to the spot shot and flushes brands as of august  however  if significant marketing and other initiatives related to these brands are not successful  they could potentially become impaired 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on the significant assumptions and estimates used in the valuation of the indefinite lived intangible assets related to the spot shot and flushes brands as of august   and determined that a negative change in our significant assumptions and estimates would have resulted in the following potential impairment charges the approximate impact of the change in each significant assumption and estimate assumes all other assumptions and estimates remain constant  in millions  except percentages spot shot potential impairment charges basis point decrease in assumed royalty rate decrease in forecasted sales revenue flushes basis point decrease in assumed royalty rate decrease in forecasted sales revenue negative changes in other assumptions and estimates  such as advertising and promotional expenses  cost of products sold  gross margins  operating margins  the success of product innovations and introductions  customer retention  development of new and or alternative distribution channels  tax rates and terminal growth values  could result in further impairment 

table of contents we will continue to closely monitor events and circumstances that could result in impairment of the indefinite lived intangible assets related to spot shot and flushes brands 
it is possible that changes in circumstances  existing at that time or at other times in the future  or in the numerous variables associated with the assumptions and estimates made by us in assessing the appropriate valuation of our indefinite lived intangible assets  could in the future require us to record further impairment charges
