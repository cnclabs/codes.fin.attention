these unaudited schedules provide selected financial information concerning the company that should be read in conjunction with item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a publicly traded bank holding company with five wholly owned subsidiaries the bank  a state chartered  full service commercial bank  nisc  a company formed to invest in both elliott cove  an investment advisory services company  and pwa  an investment advisory  trust and wealth management business located in seattle  washington  nct and nst  entities formed to facilitate two trust preferred securities offerings  and nbl  which owns and operates the company s main office facility at c street in anchorage 
the bank in turn has a wholly owned subsidiary  ncic  which has an interest in rml holding company  a residential mortgage holding company and nbg  an insurance brokerage company that provides employee benefit plans to businesses throughout alaska 
we are headquartered in anchorage and have branch locations  seven in anchorage  two in fairbanks  and one each in eagle river and wasilla 
the bank also operates northrim funding services  a division headquartered in bellevue  washington with operations in the washington and oregon markets 
we offer a wide array of commercial and consumer loan and deposit products  investment products  and electronic banking services over the internet 
we opened the bank for business in anchorage in the bank became the wholly owned subsidiary of the company effective december   when we completed our bank holding company reorganization 
we opened our first branch in fairbanks in  and our second location in anchorage in during the second quarter of  we purchased eight branches located in anchorage  eagle river and wasilla from bank of america 
this acquisition resulted in us acquiring million in loans  million in deposits and million in fixed assets for a purchase price of million 
then  in october of  we acquired of the outstanding stock of another local bank  alaska first 
this acquisition resulted in us acquiring cash equivalents and investments of million  outstanding loans of million  deposits of million and borrowings of million 
one of our major objectives is to increase our market share in anchorage  fairbanks  and the matanuska valley  alaska s three largest urban areas 
we estimate that we hold a share of the commercial bank deposit market in anchorage  share of the fairbanks market  and a share of the matanuska valley market as of june  our growth and operations depend upon the economic conditions of alaska and the specific markets we serve 
the economy of alaska is dependent upon the natural resources industries  in particular oil production  as well as tourism  government  and us military spending 
according to the state of alaska department of revenue  approximately of the alaska state government is funded through various taxes and royalties on the oil industry 
any significant changes in the alaska economy and the markets we serve eventually could have a positive or negative impact on the company 
at december   we had assets of over billion  a decrease of less than from december  also  we had gross loans of million at december   a decrease of less than from million at december  our net income and diluted earnings per share for were million and  respectively  a decrease of for each item  respectively  from million and at year end during the same time period  our net interest income decreased by million  or  to million  from million for the year ended our provision for loan losses in increased by million  or to million  from million in  as our nonperforming loans for increased by million  or  from million in to million in in our other operating income increased by million  or  to million from million in critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and on our results of operations for the reporting periods 
the accounting policies that involve significant estimates and assumptions by management  which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  are considered critical accounting policies 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments are as follows allowance for loan losses the allowance the company maintains an allowance to reflect inherent losses from its loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance is decreased by loan charge offs and increased by loan recoveries and 
table of contents provisions for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis  the company calculates the allowance based on an established methodology which has been consistently applied 
in determining its total allowance  the company first estimates a specific allowance for impaired loans 
this analysis is based upon a specific analysis for each impaired loan  including appraisals on loans secured by real property  management s assessment of the current market  recent payment history and an evaluation of other sources of repayment 
with regard to our appraisal process  the company obtains appraisals on real and personal property that secure its loans during the loan origination process in accordance with regulatory guidance and its loan policy 
the company obtains updated appraisals on loans secured by real or personal property based upon its assessment of changes in the current market or particular projects or properties  information from other current appraisals  and other sources of information 
the company uses the information provided in these updated appraisals along with its evaluation of all other information available on a particular property as it assesses the collateral coverage on its performing and nonperforming loans and the impact that may have on the adequacy of its allowance 
the company then estimates an allowance for all loans that are not impaired 
this allowance is based on loss factors applied to loans that are quality graded according to an internal risk classification system classified loans 
the company s internal risk classifications are based in large part upon regulatory definitions for classified loans 
the loss factors that the company applies to each group of loans within the various risk classifications are based on industry standards  historical experience and management s judgment 
portfolio components also receive specific attention in the allowance analysis when those components constitute a significant concentration as a percentage of the company s capital  when current market or economic conditions point to increased scrutiny  or when historical or recent experience suggests that additional attention is warranted in the analysis process 
once the allowance is determined using the methodology described above  management assesses the adequacy of the overall allowance through an analysis of the size and mix of the loan portfolio  historical and recent credit performance of the loan portfolio including the absolute level and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans  industry metrics and ratio analysis 
we recognize the determination of the allowance is sensitive to the assigned credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates at any given point in time 
therefore  we perform a sensitivity analysis to provide insight regarding the impact of adverse changes in risk ratings may have on our allowance 
the sensitivity analysis does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in our loans risk ratings and it does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance due to the numerous quantitative and qualitative factors considered in determining our allowance 
at december   in the event that percent of our loans were downgraded from the pass category to the special mention category within our current allowance methodology  the allowance would have increased by approximately based on our methodology and its components  management believes the resulting allowance is adequate and appropriate for the risk identified in the company s loan portfolio 
given current processes employed by the company  management believes the risk ratings and inherent loss rates currently assigned are appropriate 
it is possible that others  given the same information  may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be material to the company s financial statements 
in addition  current risk ratings and fair value estimates of collateral are subject to change as we continue to review loans within our portfolio and as our borrowers are impacted by economic trends within their market areas 
although we have established an allowance that we consider adequate  there can be no assurance that the established allowance will be sufficient to offset losses on loans in the future 
goodwill and other intangibles net assets of entities acquired in purchase transactions are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition 
identified intangibles are amortized over the period benefited either on a straight line basis or on an accelerated basis depending on the nature of the intangible 
goodwill is not amortized  although it is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level 
the company has only one reporting unit 
under applicable accounting standards  goodwill impairment analysis is a two step test 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  involves comparing each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  applicable goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  there is an indication of impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit  as determined in the first step  over the aggregate fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill in the pro forma business combination accounting as described above exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the 
table of contents amount of goodwill  and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill 
subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted under applicable accounting standards 
at december   we utilized two methods of estimating the fair value of the company an income method that incorporates discounted cash flows and a market comparison method 
as our market capitalization declined and financial sector volatility increased  we weighted these methods based on how we believe they best represent a market participant s view of fair value 
the income and market comparison were given weights of and  respectively 
as a result  at december   we relied primarily on the income method  using management projections and risk adjusted discount rates  as we considered it to be most reflective of a market participant s view of fair value given the current market conditions 
the income method used at december  utilized discount rates that we believe adequately reflected the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally developed earnings projections 
this method employs a capital asset pricing model in estimating the discount rate ie  cost of equity financing 
the inputs to this model include risk free rate of return  beta  market equity risk premium  and an unsystematic company specific risk factor 
the unsystematic risk factor is the input that specifically addresses uncertainty related to our projections of earnings and growth  including the uncertainty related to loss expectations 
in the market comparison approach used at december   management selected a set of comparable companies located in the western region of the united states with similar asset size and that are publicly traded on a national exchange 
the market value on an adjusted control basis was measured based on the market capitalization of comparable companies and the application of a control premium that represents the potential additional value which would be received from a market participant acquirer assuming the sale of the company 
investors are willing to pay a premium for control of a company  as evidenced by the historically sizeable premiums typically paid in mergers and acquisitions 
management applied a control premium of to these values based on observation of historically observable control premiums and the current market environment 
for the december   goodwill impairment test  we calculated a total company fair value of million based on the analysis described above 
the table below details estimated fair values using each method as well as market capitalization 
estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is a very subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments  particularly related to cash flows  the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium 
equity value weight weighted value in thousands income approach management forecasts market approach western publicly traded guideline companies concluded fair value of equity weighted market capitalization plus control premium of at december   the company performed both step and step of the annual impairment test and concluded that no impairment existed at that time 
the company continues to monitor the company s goodwill for potential impairment on an ongoing basis 
note to the consolidated financial statements has further information on the goodwill impairment analysis as of december  no assurance can be given that we will not charge earnings during for goodwill impairment  if  for example  our stock price declines further and continues to trade at a significant discount to its book value  although there are many factors that we analyze in determining the impairment of goodwill 
valuation of other real estate owned other real estate owned represents properties acquired through foreclosure or its equivalent 
prior to foreclosure  the carrying value is adjusted to the fair value  less cost to sell  of the real estate to be acquired by an adjustment to the allowance for loan loss 
the amount by which the fair value less cost to sell is greater than the carrying amount of the loan plus amounts previously charged off is recognized in earnings up to the original cost of the asset 
any subsequent reduction in the carrying value at acquisition is charged against earnings 
reductions in the carrying value of other real estate owned subsequent to acquisition are determined based on management s estimate of the fair value of individual properties 
significant inputs into this estimate include estimated costs to complete projects  as well as our assessment of current market conditions 
during  million in impairment was recognized on oreo due to adjustments to the company s estimate of the fair value of certain properties based on changes in estimated costs to complete the projects

our average yield on earning assets was in  in  and in  while the average cost of interest bearing liabilities was in  in and in our net interest margin decreased in from mainly due to the fact that the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased by basis points while the yield on interest earning assets decreased by basis points

the company earns income from the purchased receivable product by charging finance charges to its customers for the purchase of their accounts receivable 
the income from this product has grown as the company has used it to purchase more receivables from its customers 
in  the company stopped offering one of its purchased receivable products in alaska  which accounts for the slower growth rate for this product during that time 
in december of  the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary ncic  purchased an additional interest in nbg  which brought its ownership interest in this company to 
as a result of this increase in ownership  the company now consolidates the balance sheet and income statement of nbg into its financial statements

analysis of allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance to reflect inherent losses from its loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance is decreased by loan charge offs and increased by loan recoveries and provisions for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis  the company calculates the allowance based on an established methodology which has been consistently applied 
in determining its total allowance  the company first estimates a specific allowance for impaired loans 
this analysis is based upon a specific analysis for each impaired loan  including appraisals on loans secured by real property  management s assessment of the current market  recent payment history and an evaluation of other sources of repayment 
with regard to our appraisal process  the company obtains appraisals on real and personal property that secure its loans during the loan origination process in accordance with regulatory guidance and its loan policy 
the company obtains updated appraisals on loans secured by 
table of contents real or personal property based upon its assessment of changes in the current market or particular projects or properties  information from other current appraisals  and other sources of information 
the company uses the information provided in these updated appraisals along with its evaluation of all other information available on a particular property as it assesses the collateral coverage on its performing and nonperforming loans and the impact that may have on the adequacy of its allowance 
the company then estimates an allowance for all loans that are not impaired 
this allowance is based on loss factors applied to loans that are quality graded according to an internal risk classification system classified loans 
the company s internal risk classifications are based in large part upon regulatory definitions for classified loans 
the loss factors that the company applies to each group of loans within the various risk classifications are based on industry standards  historical experience and management s judgment 
portfolio components also receive specific attention in the allowance analysis when those components constitute a significant concentration as a percentage of the company s capital  when current market or economic conditions point to increased scrutiny  or when historical or recent experience suggests that additional attention is warranted in the analysis process 
once the allowance is determined using the methodology described above  management assesses the adequacy of the overall allowance through an analysis of the size and mix of the loan portfolio  historical and recent credit performance of the loan portfolio including the absolute level and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans  industry metrics and ratio analysis 
the unallocated portion of the allowance at december  increased to million from million at december  this increase reflects management s assumption that there is higher inherent risk in the remaining portfolio in today s lending environment 
our banking regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance 
our regulators may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments related to information available to them at the time of their examinations 
at december   nonperforming loans increased to million  or of portfolio loans as compared to million  or of portfolio loans at december  in addition  the coverage ratio of the allowance for loan losses verses nonperforming loans decreased to in as compared to a coverage ratio of in the increase in nonperforming loans and potential problem loans has been factored into the company s methodology for analyzing its allowance on a consistent basis 
the company has also taken steps to improve its credit quality including the formation of a quality assurance department to provide independent  detailed financial analysis of its largest  most complex loans  which it believes will help to improve its credit quality in the future 
management believes that at december   the allowance is adequate to cover losses that are probable in light of our current loan portfolio and existing economic conditions 
in october  the company acquired million in loans as a part of its acquisition of alaska first 
the company has determined that acquisition of these loans did not cause any material changes in the risk characteristics of the company s loan portfolio 
the increase in nonperforming loans between december  and december  in general has been caused by an increase in nonperforming residential construction and land development loans which have increased due to several factors 
first  there has been a slowdown in the residential real estate sales cycle in the company s major markets that has been caused in part by more restrictive mortgage lending standards that has decreased the number of eligible purchasers for residential properties 
in addition  there has been a decrease in new construction activity 
as a result  inventory levels have remained approximately constant over the last year 
second  the slowdown in the sales cycle and the decrease in new construction have led to slower absorption of residential lots 
third  a number of the company s residential construction and land development borrowers have been unable to profitably operate in this slower real estate market 
as a result of the slower residential real estate market  the company expects that its level of lending in this sector will decrease which will lead to a lower level of earnings from this portion of its loan portfolio 
while management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the allowance for loan losses  unforeseen market conditions and other events could result in adjustment to the allowance for loan losses  and net income could be significantly affected  if circumstances differed substantially from the assumptions used in making the final determination

management has consistently applied its methodology for calculating the allowance for loan losses from period to period  and the unallocated portion of the allowance has increased in to address the impact of the current economic environment on our loan portfolio 

table of contents credit authority and loan limits all of our loans and credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations 
these limitations apply to the borrower s total outstanding indebtedness and commitments to us  including the indebtedness of any guarantor 
generally  we are permitted to make loans to one borrower of up to of the unimpaired capital and surplus of the bank 
the loan to one borrower limitation for the bank was million at december  at december   the company had four relationships whose total direct and indirect commitments exceeded million  however no individual direct relationship exceeded the limit 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provision for loan losses 
loan policy our lending operations are guided by loan policies  which outline the basic policies and procedures by which lending operations are conducted 
generally  the policies address our desired loan types  target markets  underwriting and collateral requirements  terms  interest rate and yield considerations  and compliance with laws and regulations 
the policies are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
we supplement our own supervision of the loan underwriting and approval process with periodic loan reviews by experienced officers who examine quality  loan documentation  and compliance with laws and regulations 
our quality assurance department also provides independent  detailed financial analysis of our largest  most complex loans 
in addition  the department  along with the chief lending officer and others in the loan administration department  has developed processes to analyze and manage various concentrations of credit within the overall loan portfolio 
the loan administration department has also enhanced the procedures and processes for the analysis and reporting of problem loans along with the development of strategies to resolve them 
loans receivable loans receivable decreased to million at december   compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december   of the portfolio was scheduled to mature or reprice in with scheduled to mature or reprice between and future growth in loans is generally dependent on new loan demand and deposit growth  constrained by our policy of being well capitalized as determined by the fdic

table of contents the following table presents at december   the aggregate maturity and repricing data of our loan portfolio maturity within over year years years total in thousands commercial construction real estate term home equity lines and other consumer total fixed interest rate floating interest rate total commercial loans our commercial loan portfolio includes both secured and unsecured loans for working capital and expansion 
short term working capital loans generally are secured by accounts receivable  inventory  or equipment 
we also make longer term commercial loans secured by equipment and real estate 
we also make commercial loans that are guaranteed in large part by the small business administration or the bureau of indian affairs and commercial real estate loans that are participated with the alaska industrial development and export authority aidea 
commercial loans represented of our total loans outstanding as of december  and reprice more frequently than other types of loans  such as real estate loans 
more frequent repricing means that commercial loans are more sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in a rising interest rate environment  our philosophy is to emphasize the pricing of loans on a floating rate basis  which allows these loans to reprice more frequently and to contribute positively to our net interest margin 
the majority of these loans reprice to an index based upon the prime rate of interest 
in  the company began to implement floors in its loans as they were originated or renewed during the year 
construction loans land development we believe we are a major land development and residential construction lender 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of residential subdivision land development loans outstanding  or and of total loans 
one to four family residences we financed approximately one fifth of the single family houses constructed in anchorage in we originated one to four family residential construction loans to builders for construction of homes 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of one to four family residential and condominium construction loans  or and of total loans 
of the homes under construction at december  and  for which these loans had been made  and were subject to sale contracts between the builder and homebuyers who were pre qualified for loans  usually with other financial institutions 
the company s construction loans decreased from million to million in due to the continued decrease in new construction activity 
the company expects continued slowness in residential construction in  which  along with management s efforts to decrease loans measured for impairment and oreo  much of which is secured by residential construction and land development loans  should lead to further decreases in its construction loan balances 
commercial construction we also provide construction lending for commercial real estate projects 
such loans generally are made only when there is a firm take out commitment upon completion of the project by a third party lender 
commercial real estate we believe we are an active lender in the commercial real estate market 
at december   our commercial real estate loans were million  or of our loan portfolio  an increase over million  or of our loan portfolio at december  these loans are typically secured by office buildings  apartment complexes or warehouses 
loan maturities range from to years  ordinarily subject to our right to call the loan within to years of its origination 
the interest rate for approximately of these loans originated by northrim resets every one to five years based on the spread over an index rate  and reset on either a daily or monthly basis 
the indices for these loans have historically been prime or the respective 
table of contents treasury rate 
in  the company began to use the interest rates of the federal home loan bank of seattle as an additional index 
in addition  the company began to implement floors in its interest rates for loans originated or renewed during the year 
we may sell all or a portion of our commercial real estate loans to two state of alaska entities that were established to provide long term financing in the state  aidea  and the alaska housing finance corporation ahfc 
we may sell up to a loan participation to aidea 
aidea s portion of the participated loan typically features a maturity twice that of the portion retained by us and bears a lower interest rate 
the blend of our and aidea s loan terms allows us to provide competitive long term financing to our customers  while reducing the risk inherent in this type of lending 
we also originate and sell to ahfc loans secured by multifamily residential units 
typically  of these loans are sold to ahfc and we provide ongoing servicing of the loans for a fee 
aidea and ahfc make it possible for us to originate these commercial real estate loans and enhance fee income while reducing our exposure to risk 
home equity lines and other consumer loans we provide personal loans for automobiles  recreational vehicles  boats  and other larger consumer purchases 
we provide both secured and unsecured consumer credit lines to accommodate the needs of our individual customers  with home equity lines of credit serving as the major product in this area 
off balance sheet arrangements commitments and contingent liabilities in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various types of transactions that include commitments to extend credit that are not reflected on our balance sheet 
we apply the same credit standards to these commitments as in all of our lending activities and include these commitments in our lending risk evaluations 
our exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments

these funds  together with loan repayments  loan sales  other borrowed funds  retained earnings  and equity are used to make loans  to acquire securities and other assets  and to fund deposit flows and continuing operations 
the primary sources of demands on our liquidity are customer demands for withdrawal of deposits and borrowers demands that we advance funds against unfunded lending commitments

additionally  as noted above  our total deposits at december   were million 

table of contents on february   the board of directors approved payment of a per share dividend on february   to shareholders of record on february  this is a decrease of per share from the company s last dividend of per share that was declared in october the company reduced the dividend to reflect a payout level more consistent with earnings 
additionally  management believes that the decrease is the prudent course of action considering the uncertain economic and regulatory environment 
the sources by which we meet the liquidity needs of our customers are current assets and borrowings available through our correspondent banking relationships and our credit lines with the federal reserve bank and the fhlb 
at december   our current assets were million and our funds available for borrowing under our existing lines of credit were million 
given these sources of liquidity and our expectations for customer demands for cash and for our operating cash needs  we believe our sources of liquidity to be sufficient in the foreseeable future 
however  continued deterioration in the fhlb of seattle s financial position may result in impairment in the value of our fhlb stock  the requirement that the company contribute additional funds to recapitalize the fhlb of seattle  or a reduction in the company s ability to borrow funds from the fhlb of seattle  impairing the company s ability to meet liquidity demands 
in september  our board of directors approved a plan whereby we would periodically repurchase for cash up to approximately  or  of our shares of common stock in the open market 
in august of  the board of directors amended the stock repurchase plan and increased the number of shares available under the program by of total shares outstanding  or  shares 
in june of  the board of directors amended the stock repurchase plan and increased the number of shares available under the program by of total shares outstanding  or  shares 
we have purchased  shares of our stock under this program through december  at a total cost of million at an average price of  which leaves a balance of  shares available under the stock repurchase program 
no shares were repurchased on we intend to continue to repurchase our stock from time to time depending upon market conditions  but we can make no assurances that we will continue this program or that we will repurchase all of the authorized shares 
the stock repurchase program had an effect on earnings per share because it decreased the total number of shares outstanding in   and  by   and  shares respectively 
the company did not repurchase any of its shares in or the table below shows this effect on diluted earnings per share

we are subject to minimum capital requirements 
federal banking agencies have adopted regulations establishing minimum requirements for the capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies 
the requirements address both risk based capital and 
table of contents leverage capital 
we believe as of december   that the company and northrim bank met all applicable capital adequacy requirements 
the fdic has in place qualifications for banks to be classified as well capitalized 
as of december   the most recent notification from the fdic categorized northrim bank as well capitalized 
there were no conditions or events since the fdic notification that we believe have changed northrim bank s classification 
the table below illustrates the capital requirements for the company and the bank and the actual capital ratios for each entity that exceed these requirements 
based on recent turmoil in the financial markets and the increase in the company s loans measured for impairment and oreo  management intends to maintain a tier risk based capital ration for the bank in excess of in  exceeding the fdic s well capitalized capital requirement classification 
the capital ratio for the company exceed those for the bank primarily because the million trust preferred securities offering that the company completed in the second quarter of and another offering of million completed in the fourth quarter of are included in the company s capital for regulatory purposes although they are accounted for as a long term debt in our financial statements 
the trust preferred securities are not accounted for on the bank s financial statements nor are they included in its capital 
as a result  the company has million more in regulatory capital than the bank  which explains most of the difference in the capital ratios for the two entities 
adequately well actual actual december  capitalized capitalized ratio bhc ratio bank tier risk based capital total risk based capital leverage ratio see note of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the capital ratios 
effects of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates  which could affect the degree and timing of the repricing of our assets and liabilities 
in addition  inflation has an impact on our customers ability to repay their loans

the purpose of asset liability management is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting our earnings from undue interest rate risk  which arises from changes in interest rates and changes in the balance sheet mix  and by managing the risk return relationships between liquidity  interest rate risk  market risk  and capital adequacy 
we maintain an asset liability management policy that provides guidelines for controlling exposure to interest rate risk by setting a target range and minimum for the net interest margin and running simulation models under different interest rate scenarios to measure the risk to earnings over the next month period 
in order to control interest rate risk in a rising interest rate environment  our philosophy is to shorten the average maturity of the investment portfolio and emphasize the pricing of new loans on a floating rate basis in order to achieve a more asset sensitive position  therefore  allowing quicker repricings and maximizing net interest margin 
conversely  in a declining interest rate environment  our philosophy is to lengthen the average maturity of the investment portfolio and emphasize fixed rate loans  thereby becoming more liability sensitive 
in each case  the goal is to exceed our targeted net interest margin range without exceeding earnings risk parameters 
our excess liquidity not needed for current operations has generally been invested in short term assets or securities  primarily securities issued by government sponsored entities 
the securities portfolio contributes to our profits and plays an important part in the overall interest rate management 
the primary tool used to manage interest rate risk is determination of mix  maturity  and repricing characteristics of the loan portfolios 
the loan and securities portfolios must be used in combination with management of deposits and borrowing liabilities and other asset liability techniques to actively manage the applicable components of the balance sheet 
in doing so  we estimate our future needs  taking into consideration historical periods of high loan demand and low deposit balances  estimated loan and deposit increases  and estimated interest rate changes 
although analysis of interest rate gap the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities during a given period of time is one standard tool for the measurement of exposure to interest rate risk  we believe that because interest rate gap analysis does not address all factors that can affect earnings performance  it should not be used as the primary indicator of exposure to interest rate risk and the related volatility of net interest income in a changing interest rate environment 
interest rate gap analysis is primarily a measure of liquidity based upon the amount of change in principal amounts of assets and liabilities outstanding  as opposed to a measure of changes in the overall net interest margin 

table of contents the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing  and the resulting interest rate gap  of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts in the table are derived from internal data based upon regulatory reporting formats and  therefore  may not be wholly consistent with financial information appearing elsewhere in the audited financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the amounts shown below could also be significantly affected by external factors such as changes in prepayment assumptions  early withdrawals of deposits  and competition 
estimated maturity or repricing at december  within year years years total in thousands interest earning assets money market investments domestic certificates of deposit investment securities loans commercial real estate construction real estate term installment and other consumer total interest earning assets percent of total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand accounts money market accounts savings accounts certificates of deposit short term borrowings long term borrowings junior subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities percent of total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets as stated previously  certain shortcomings  including those described below  are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets have features that restrict changes in their interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the lives of the assets 
further  in the event of a change in market interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables as can the relationship of rates between different loan and deposit categories 
moreover  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an increase in market interest rates 

table of contents we utilize a simulation model to monitor and manage interest rate risk within parameters established by our internal policy 
the model projects the impact of a basis point increase and a basis point decrease  from prevailing interest rates  on the balance sheet over a period of months 
generalized assumptions are made on how investment securities  classes of loans and various deposit products might respond to the interest rate changes 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income nor precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results would differ from simulated results due to factors such as timing  magnitude and frequency of rate changes  customer reaction to rate changes  changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
based on the results of the simulation models at december   we expect a decrease in net interest income of  and an increase of million in net interest income over a month period  if interest rates decreased or increased an immediate basis points  respectively 
as indicated in the table above  at december   the company s interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature faster than the company s earning assets by a margin of million over the next months 
the results of the simulation model indicate a decrease in net interest income in a falling rate environment and an increase in net interest income in a rising rate environment because the repricing of interest bearing liabilities will lag the repricing of earning assets 
additionally  in some instances  the extent to which interest bearing liabilities reprice may not reach that of earning assets due in part to the historically low level of interest rates

estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenue and expenses for the period and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates include the allowance for loan losses  valuation of goodwill and other intangibles  and valuation of other real estate owned 
cash and cash equivalents for purposes of reporting cash flows  cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand  amounts due from banks  interest bearing balances with other banks  money market investments including interest bearing balances with the fhlb  banker s acceptances  commercial paper  securities purchased under agreement to resell  federal funds sold  and securities with maturities of less than days at acquisition 
investment securities securities available for sale are stated at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses  net of tax  excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income  unless an unrealized loss is deemed other than temporary 
gains and losses on available for sale securities sold are determined on a specific identification basis 
held to maturity securities are stated at cost  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount on a level yield basis 
the company has the ability and intent to hold these securities to maturity 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale or held to maturity security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and the establishment of a new cost basis for the security 
unrealized investment securities losses are evaluated at least quarterly on a specific identification basis to determine whether such declines in value should be considered other than temporary and therefore be subject to immediate loss recognition in income 
although these evaluations involve significant judgment  an unrealized loss in the fair value of a debt security is generally deemed to be temporary when the fair value of the security is below the carrying value primarily due to changes in interest rates  there has not been significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer  and the company has the intent and ability to hold the security for a sufficient time to recover the carrying value 
other factors that may be considered in determining whether a decline in the value is other than temporary include ratings by recognized rating agencies  actions of commercial banks or other lenders relative to the continued extension of credit facilities to the issuer of the security  the financial condition  capital strength and near term prospects of the issuer  and recommendations of investment advisors or market analysts 
loans  recognition of interest income and loan fees loans are carried at their principal amount outstanding  net of unamortized fees and direct loan origination costs 
interest income on loans is accrued and recognized on the principal amount outstanding except 
table of contents for loans in a non accrual status 
loans are placed on non accrual when management believes doubt exists as to the collectibility of the interest or principal 
cash payments received on non accrual loans are directly applied to the principal balance 
generally  a loan may be returned to accrual status when the delinquent principal and interest are brought current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and certain ongoing performance criteria have been met 
the company considers a loan to be impaired when it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
once a loan is determined to be impaired  the impairment is measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that if the loan is collateral dependant  the impairment is measured by using the fair value of the loan s collateral 
nonperforming loans greater than  are individually evaluated for impairment based upon the borrower s overall financial condition  resources  and payment record  and the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors 
loan origination fees received in excess of direct origination costs are deferred and accreted to interest income using a method approximating the level yield method over the life of the loan 
allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses the allowance to reflect inherent losses from its loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance is decreased by loan charge offs and increased by loan recoveries and provisions for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis  the company calculates the allowance based on an established methodology which has been consistently applied 
in determining its total allowance  the company first estimates a specific allowance for impaired loans 
this analysis is based upon a specific analysis for each impaired loan  including appraisals on loans secured by real property  management s assessment of the current market  recent payment history and an evaluation of other sources of repayment 
the company then estimates an allowance for all loans that are not impaired 
this allowance is based on loss factors applied to loans that are quality graded according to an internal risk classification system classified loans 
the company s internal risk classifications are based in large part upon regulatory definitions for classified loans 
the loss factors that the company applies to each group of loans within the various risk classifications are based on industry standards  historical experience and management s judgment 
portfolio components also receive specific attention in the allowance analysis when those components constitute a significant concentration as a percentage of the company s capital  when current market or economic conditions point to increased scrutiny  or when historical or recent experience suggests that additional attention is warranted in the analysis process 
once the allowance is determined using the methodology described above  management assesses the adequacy of the overall allowance through an analysis of the size and mix of the loan portfolio  historical and recent credit performance of the loan portfolio including the absolute level and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans  industry metrics and ratio analysis 
our banking regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance 
our regulators may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments related to information available to them at the time of their examinations 
while management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the allowance for loan losses  unforeseen market conditions and other events could result in adjustment to the allowance for loan losses  and net income could be significantly affected  if circumstances differed substantially from the assumptions used in making the final determination 
purchased receivables the bank purchases accounts receivable at a discount from its customers 
the purchased receivables are carried at cost 
the discount and fees charged to the customer are earned while the balances of the purchases are outstanding 
in the event an impairment or write down is evident and warranted  the charge is taken against the asset balance and not from the allowance for loan losses 
premises and equipment premises and equipment  including leasehold improvements  are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for financial reporting purposes is computed using the straight line method based upon the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets that vary according to the asset type and include  vehicles at years  furniture and equipment ranging between and years  leasehold improvements ranging between and years  and buildings over years 
maintenance and repairs are charged to current operations  while renewals and betterments are capitalized

a variable interest entity is an entity whose equity investors lack the ability to make decisions about the entity s activity through voting rights and do not have the obligation to absorb the entity s expected losses or receive residual returns if they occur 
the company made commitments to purchase a million interest in each of these partnerships in january  september and december  respectively 
other real estate owned other real estate owned represents properties acquired through foreclosure or its equivalent 
prior to foreclosure  the carrying value is adjusted to the fair value  less cost to sell  of the real estate to be acquired by an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses 
management s evaluation of fair value is based on appraisals or discounted cash flows of anticipated sales 
the amount by which the fair value less cost to sell is greater than the carrying amount of the loan plus amounts previously charged off is recognized in earnings up to the original cost of the asset 
any subsequent reduction in the carrying value is charged against earnings 
operating expenses associated with other real estate owned are charged to earnings in the period they are incurred 
advertising advertising  promotion and marketing costs are expensed as incurred 
the company reported total expenses of million for each of the periods ending december    and income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the future consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date

concentrations substantially all of our business is derived from the anchorage  matanuska valley  and fairbanks  areas of alaska 
as such  he company s growth and operations depend upon the economic conditions of alaska and these specific markets 
these areas rely primarily upon the natural resources industries  particularly oil production  as well as tourism  government and us military spending for their economic success

our business is and will remain sensitive to economic factors that relate to these industries and local and regional business conditions 
as a result  local or regional economic downturns  or downturns that disproportionately affect one or more of the key industries in regions served by the company  may have a more pronounced effect upon its business than they might on an institution that is less geographically concentrated 
the extent of the future impact of these events on economic and business conditions cannot be predicted  however  prolonged or acute fluctuations could have a material and adverse impact upon our results of operation and financial condition

while management uses what it believes are pertinent factors in estimating the liability  it is subject to change due to claim experience  type of claims  and rising medical costs 
off balance sheet financial instruments in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into various types of transactions that involve financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and are not reflected in the accompanying balance sheets 
these transactions may involve to varying degrees credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount  if any  recognized in the balance sheets 
management does not anticipate any loss as a result of these commitments 
the company s off balance sheet credit risk exposure is the contractual amount of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
the company applies the same credit standards to these contracts as it uses in its lending process 
december  in thousands off balance sheet commitments commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers 
these commitments have specified interest rates and generally have fixed expiration dates but may be terminated by the company if certain conditions of the contract are violated 
although currently subject to draw down  many of the commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
collateral held relating to these commitments varies  but generally includes real estate  inventory  accounts receivable  and equipment 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
credit risk arises in these transactions from the possibility that a customer may not be able to repay the company upon default of performance 
collateral held for standby letters of credit is based on an individual evaluation of each customer s creditworthiness 
note regulatory matters the company and northrim bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and northrim bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the company s and northrim bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory practices 
the company s and northrim bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgment by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
federal banking agencies have established minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital to risk weighted assets  and of tier i capital to average assets 
the regulations set forth the definitions of capital  risk weighted and average assets 
as of december   the most recent notification from the fdic categorized the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
management believes  as of december   that the company and northrim bank met all capital adequacy requirements 
the tables below illustrate the capital requirements for the company and the bank and the actual capital ratios for each entity that exceed these requirements 
management intends to maintain a tier risk based capital ratio for the bank in excess of in  exceeding the fdic s well capitalized capital requirement classification 
the dividends that the bank pays to the company are limited to the extent necessary for the bank to meet the regulatory requirements of a well capitalized bank 
the capital 
table of contents ratios for the company exceed those for the bank primarily because the million trust preferred securities offerings that the company completed in the second quarter of and in the fourth quarter of are included in the company s capital for regulatory purposes although they are accounted for as a liability in its financial statements 
the trust preferred securities are not accounted for on the bank s financial statements nor are they included in its capital 
as a result  the company has million more in regulatory capital than the bank at december  and  which explains most of the difference in the capital ratios for the two entities

the company elected not to value any additional assets or liabilities at fair value in accordance with sfas on january   the company also adopted the provisions of sfas this statement defines fair value  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements for fair value measurement 
this statement applies whenever assets or liabilities are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under currently existing standards 
fair value hierarchy in accordance with fasb statement  the company groups its assets and liabilities measured at fair value in three levels  based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value 
these levels are level valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active exchange markets  such as the new york stock exchange 
level also includes us treasury and federal agency securities  which are traded by dealers or brokers in active markets 
valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities 

table of contents level valuation is based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market 
level valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market 
these unobservable assumptions reflect the company s estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
valuation techniques include use of option pricing models  discounted cash flow models and similar techniques 
the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair value disclosures 
all financial instruments are held for other than trading purposes 
cash and money market investments due to the short term nature of these instruments  the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet represent their fair values 
investment securities fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments 
investments in federal home loan bank stock are recorded at cost  which also represents fair value 
loans in  fair value adjustments for loans are mainly related to credit risk  interest rate risk  required equity return  and liquidity risk 
credit risk is primarily addressed in the financial statements through the allowance for loan losses see note 
loans are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology and are pooled based on similar characteristics  such as underlying collateral  type of interest rate fixed or adjustable  types of amortization  and other similar factors 
a discount rate was developed based on the relative risk of the cash flows  taking into account the loan type  the maturity of the loans  liquidity risk and a required return on debt and capital 
an additional liquidity risk is estimated primarily using observable  historical sales of loans during periods of similar economic conditions 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas  impaired loans are carried at fair value 
specific valuation allowances are included in the allowance for loan losses 
the carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates its fair value 
in  loans were discounted using expected future cash flows  and impaired loans were recorded as described above in accordance with sfas purchased receivables fair values for purchased receivables are based on their carrying amounts due to their short duration and repricing frequency 
deposit liabilities the fair values of demand and savings deposits are equal to the carrying amount at the reporting date 
the carrying amount for variable rate time deposits approximate their fair value 
fair values for fixed rate time deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies currently offered interest rates to a schedule of aggregate expected monthly maturities of time deposits 
the carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates its fair value 
borrowings due to the short term nature of these instruments  the carrying amount of short term borrowings reported in the balance sheet approximate the fair value 
fair values for fixed rate long term borrowings are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies currently offered interest rates to a schedule of aggregate expected monthly payments 
junior subordinated debentures fair value adjustments for junior subordinated debentures are based on the current discounted cash flows to maturity 
management utilized a market approach to determine the appropriate discount rate for junior subordinated debentures 
assets subject to non recurring adjustment to fair value the company may be required to measure certain assets such as equity method investments  intangible assets or oreo at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with gaap 
any nonrecurring adjustments to fair value usually result from the write down of individual assets 
effective january   the company will be required to disclose the fair value of these non financial assets and liabilities in accordance with fasb staff position commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit the fair value of commitments is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements  taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties 
for fixed rate loan commitments  fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates 
the fair value of letters of credit is based on fees currently charged for similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise settle the obligation with the counterparties at the reporting date 
limitations fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time  based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument 
these estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument 
because no market exists for a significant portion of the company s financial instruments  fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience  current economic conditions  risk characteristics of various financial instruments  and other factors 
these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision 
changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates
