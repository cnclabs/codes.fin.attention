item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation all percentage amounts and ratios were calculated using the underlying data in thousands 
operating results for the year ended december  are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future fiscal years 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
overview since our inception  we have invested heavily in developing technology  laboratory systems and software to automate  accelerate and digitize traditional r d and pursue high throughput materials research 
our scientific team has deep technical expertise 
through symyx software  we offer customers integrated r d collaboration  execution and analysis applications  and access to scientific content and industry leading chemical informatics  logistics and decision support applications 
through symyx hpr  we provide research services to our customers and sometimes enter into longer term  broad technical alliances for discovery and development of new materials 
we also apply our expertise in high throughput research technologies to offer automated tools to enable improved r d execution in our customers laboratories 
we generate revenue and cash flows from operations from licensing symyx software  subscriptions to certain scientific content and accompanying services and support  from selling and supporting symyx hpr tools  from providing research services  and from licenses and royalties from our discovered materials and intellectual property 
recent events our major recent events and their impact on our business are highlighted below impairment to goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets valuation allowance in december  we recorded a million impairment charge to goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets as discussed below under the heading of impairment to goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
we also recorded in the fourth quarter a million valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
the impact of these charges and allowance on our financials is disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring in december  we announced a reorganization of our business in which we combined our former symyx tools and symyx research business units into a single unit  symyx hpr  moved from a single combined sales force to dedicated sales forces within our business units  and reduced our workforce by approximately 
we expect to savings from these action will be approximately million in we recorded restructuring charges of million in  including approximately million of cash charges  of which million was paid as of december  with regard to the restructuring plan commenced in october that related to the acquisition of mdl information systems  inc mdl  we made cash payments of approximately million in symyx notebook in april  we announced the availability of symyx notebook  our new  enterprise eln that is readily and easily configurable to meet the needs of biologists and analytical chemists  and enables r d organizations to replace multiple discipline specific elns with a single  multi discipline application deployable across the enterprise 
symyx notebook became available in the fourth quarter of  and was instrumental in customer successes with of the top worldwide pharmaceutical companies 
symyx isentris in september  we announced a significant release of the symyx isentris informatics system that provides scientists the freedom to create  manage  and share fully searchable local databases and to work offline 
going well beyond our industry leading isis software  symyx isentris is a key release in our continuing isis to isentris customer migration 

table of contents acquisition of integrity biosolution  llc in august  we used million cash to acquire integrity biosolution  a camarillo  california based provider of protein formulation and fill finish services to the biotechnology sector 
research services for life sciences launch in july  we launched our new client directed and collaborative research services for life sciences  providing clients access to our installed base of parallel experimentation and testing capabilities through packaged offerings for solubility studies  polymorph screening  salt selection  co crystallization  api stability in liquid and solid formulations  excipient compatibility  organic synthesis and process optimization 
impairment to goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets in the fourth quarter of  pursuant to our accounting policy  we performed an annual impairment test of goodwill 
as a result of this analysis  we concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill included in our symyx software and symyx hpr segments exceeded their implied fair values and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million  which is included in the caption impairment to goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
the impairment charge was determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting units within these segments as of december   with the implied fair value of the goodwill 
we considered both the income and market approaches in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill based upon a blended approach 
the income approach uses estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units discounted at estimated discount rates ranging from to 
the estimates of future operating results and cash flows were principally derived from an updated long term financial forecast developed as part of our strategic planning cycle conducted annually during the fourth quarter of the decline in the implied fair value of the goodwill and resulting impairment charge was primarily driven by the updated long term financial forecasts  which showed lower estimated near term and longer term profitability compared to estimates developed at the time of the completion of the mdl and integritybio acquisitions 
refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
in the fourth quarter of  due to the significant decline of our market capitalization  we also performed an impairment test of long lived assets 
as a result of this analysis  we concluded that the carrying amounts of intangibles and other long lived assets in symyx hpr segments exceeded their implied fair values and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million  which is also included in the caption impairment to goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
business acquisitions acquisition of integrity biosolution  llc on august   we acquired integrity biosolution  llc integritybio  a privately held research service company based in camarillo  california for approximately million  with additional contingent compensations as described below 
by acquiring integritybio  we expanded our research service offerings in the life sciences industry into biologic formulations  complementing our existing chemical formulations services 
the combination of symyx and integritybio creates a differentiated set of large molecule formulation services to customers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries by combining integritybio s formulation expertise with symyx s advanced high throughput research and informatics capabilities 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  we allocated the preliminary purchase price to the tangible assets  liabilities and intangible assets acquired  based on their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over the fair values was recorded as goodwill 
the fair value assigned to intangible assets acquired was based on estimates and assumptions determined by management 
the acquired goodwill was assigned entirely to our research business 
purchased intangibles with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective useful lives 
the total preliminary purchase price recorded for this acquisition was million  consisting of approximately million paid in cash net of cash acquired  working capital adjustments of million paid in january  and million in transaction costs  consisting of legal and other professional service fees 
the purchase price is preliminary because we will owe to the founder additional consideration calculated based on the revenue generated by integritybio s operations during the period from september to august

critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item in this annual report on form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
preparing financial statements and related disclosures requires management to exercise judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
estimates include the assumptions used in determining the implied fair value of goodwill  the forfeiture rates for stock based awards  the collectability of outstanding accounts receivables  reserve for excess or obsolete inventory  future warranty expenditures  assumptions such as the elements comprising a revenue arrangement  including the distinction between software upgrades enhancements and new products  when our products achieve technological feasibility  the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events recognized in the our financial statements or tax returns and the fair value of acquired intangible assets 
we evaluate our estimates  including those mentioned above  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
source of revenue and revenue recognition policy we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  financial accounting standards board technical bulletin  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts  the emerging issues task force consensus on issue or eitf  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  and other authoritative accounting literature 
we generate revenue from services provided under research collaborations  the sale of products  license of software  content subscriptions  provision of support and maintenance services  and the license of intellectual property 
it is possible for our customers to work with us in multiple areas of our business and contracts may include multiple elements of service revenue  product revenue  and license and royalty revenue 
in determining the basis for non software product revenue recognition  we first determine the fair value of any extended warranty services and defer this revenue to be recognized over the service period 
for those contracts that involve multiple element deliverables  we identify all deliverables and allocate revenue among the units of accounting in accordance with eitf in an arrangement that includes software that is more than incidental to the products or services as a whole  we recognize revenue from the software and software related elements  as well as any non software deliverable s for which a software deliverable is essential to its functionality  in accordance with sop service revenue consists of research and development funding received from collaborative partners as well as support and maintenance or extended warranty agreements 
product revenue consists of payments from customers for our tools  comprising hardware  associated software and intellectual property licenses and consumables 
royalties and license fees include fees for licensing of our software  intellectual property  proprietary materials and technology license payments and royalties on laboratory systems and software sold under license by third parties 

table of contents service revenue we recognize revenue from research agreements  software consulting agreements  and support and maintenance agreements as earned upon performance of the services specified in the agreements 
payments received that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue as the performance requirements are fulfilled 
non refundable up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology access fees  are deferred and recognized as earned upon performance of the services over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research term 
revenue from milestone payments  which are substantially at risk until the milestones are completed  is recognized upon completion of these milestone events 
milestone payments to date have been immaterial 
revenue allocable to support and maintenance is recognized on a straight line basis over the period the support and maintenance is provided 
our software licenses may provide for technical support  bug fixes and rights to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis for periods defined within the contract 
revenue related to this post contract customer support is deferred and recognized over the term of the contracted support 
for those arrangements that require significant production  modification  or customization of the software  such services are considered essential to software functionality 
accordingly  revenue from the entire arrangement ie  software license  database subscriptions  post contract customer support pcs and professional services is deferred until final delivery and acceptance of the product and the revenue is recognized ratably over the remaining initial pcs period or upon final delivery and acceptance when the initial pcs period has already ended 
for many customers  we have developed custom registration and other tools that are typically delivered on a time and materials basis 
these custom development projects are generally not sold in connection with a new software license deal  but rather to customers that have been using our software products for an extended period of time 
revenue from these arrangements is usually recognized on a monthly basis as the services are delivered and invoiced 
product sales we recognize revenue from the sale of symyx hpr tools and the license of associated software  and all related costs of products sold are expensed  once delivery has occurred and customer acceptance has been achieved 
a determination is made for each system delivered as to whether software is incidental to the system as a whole 
revenue from the sale of hpr tools is earned and recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if there are extended payment terms  we recognize product revenue as these payments become due 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond months not to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
in multiple element arrangements  we use the residual method to allocate revenue to delivered elements once we have established fair value for all undelivered elements 
a warranty expense accrual is established at the time of delivery for all tool sales 
software license and database content fees for database content and software licensed on an annual right to use basis  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the license 
for revenue allocable to the software portion of a multiple element arrangement or licensed on a perpetual basis  we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software product to the end user and commencement of the license  unless we have ongoing obligations for which fair value cannot be established or the fee is not fixed or determinable or collectibility is not probable  in which case we recognize revenue only when each of these criteria have been met 
by way of example  for our eln software products and the software products we acquired from mdl  we have not yet established the fair value of certain ongoing obligations and accordingly  any perpetual license fees are recognized ratably over the period of the ongoing obligations typically a bundled support and maintenance commitment of one year 
the only software product for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is our lea software product maintenance and annual licenses 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms longer than months not to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the total revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value for any remaining undelivered elements can be established 

table of contents intellectual property license fees and royalties we recognize license fee revenue for licenses to our intellectual property when earned under the terms of the agreements 
generally  revenue is recognized upon transfer of the license unless we have continuing obligations for which fair value cannot be established  in which case the revenue is recognized over the period of the obligation 
if there are extended payment terms  we recognize license fee revenue as these payments become due 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond months not to be fixed or determinable 
in certain licensing arrangements there is provision for a variable fee as well as a non refundable minimum amount 
in such arrangements  the amount of the non refundable minimum guarantee is recognized upon transfer of the license unless we have continuing obligations for which fair value cannot be established  and the amount of the variable fee in excess of the guaranteed minimum is recognized as revenue when it is fixed or determinable 
we recognize royalty revenue based on reported sales by third party licensees of products containing our materials and intellectual property 
if there are extended payment terms  royalty revenue is recognized as these payments become due 
non refundable royalties  for which there are no further performance obligations  are recognized when due under the terms of the agreements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
we assess our allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance against amounts due to us and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we record allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and our historical experience 
we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts in the amount of  upon the acquisition of mdl group companies on october  as of december   we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of stock based compensation we adopted sfas r  effective january   using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  stock based compensation expense recognized during the years after january  includes a espp awards with offering periods commencing  and stock options granted or assumed  prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  b espp awards with offering periods commencing subsequent to december  in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  and c restricted stock units  restricted stock and stock options awarded subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
under the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods are not restated 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 

table of contents accrued warranty a warranty expense accrual is established at the time of customer acceptance of a symyx tools system and is included as a cost of product sold 
management is required to exercise judgment in establishing the appropriate level of warranty expense accrual for each symyx tools system delivered and establishes the accrual based  in part  on reference to actual warranty costs incurred on similar systems 
the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material impact on our financial statements 
when actual warranty costs are anticipated to be higher than our original estimates  an additional expense is charged to cost of products sold in the period in which such a determination is made 
when actual warranty costs are lower than our original estimates  the difference will have a favorable impact to cost of products sold at the time the warranty expires for the systems 
in  and  we recorded favorable adjustments of approximately   and  respectively 
inventory we carry our inventory at the lower of cost or market  cost generally being determined on a specific identification basis 
we apply judgment in determining the provisions for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience and anticipated product demand 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

as required by sfas no 
 we test goodwill of its reporting units for impairment annually during its fourth quarter or whenever events occur or circumstances change  such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry  that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we used three reporting units in our impairment analysis symyx software  symyx research and symyx tools 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 we tests other long lived assets  including property  equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units with recognized goodwill for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these reporting units 
our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying reporting units 
in addition  we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets such as accounts receivable and property  plant and equipment to the estimated balance sheet for those reporting units 
we also consider our market capitalization adjusted for unallocated monetary assets such as cash  marketable debt securities and debt on the date we perform the analysis 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million to goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets 
see further discussion in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents accounting for income taxes income taxes have been provided using the liability method 
a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
we also recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority accordingly to financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
we consider the realizability of deferred tax assets and record valuation allowances when uncertainties related to the realization of such net deferred tax assets exist 
in  as a result of weighing all the positive and negative evidence  including our history of cumulative losses over the past three years and the difficulty of forecasting sufficient future taxable income  we recorded a million valuation allowance against federal and state deferred tax assets 
see the detailed discussion under the heading provision for income taxes in this section 
foreign currency translation we account for foreign currency translation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 foreign currency translation  as amended 
we translate the assets and liabilities of our international non us dollar functional currency subsidiaries into us dollars at the rates of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date 
revenue and expenses are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period 
translation adjustments are included in stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet caption accumulated other comprehensive income 
currency transaction losses derived from monetary assets and liabilities stated in a currency other than the functional currency and recognized in results of operations were million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the effect of foreign currency rate changes on cash and cash equivalents was decreases of   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
results of operations revenue amount in s change over previous year amount in s change over previous year amount in s service product license fees  content and royalties total revenue less than total revenue increased from to due to the increase in symyx software revenue as a result of the mdl acquisition in october  partially offset by a decrease in research revenue from exxonmobil and  to a lesser extent  dow  as well as lower hpr tools revenue due primarily to customer delays and cancellations in the second half of our total revenue in was  above revenue in  as increases in symyx software fourth quarter revenue including service and content revenue due to the mdl acquisition and slightly higher tools sales offset a decline in research service revenue and license fees and royalties 

table of contents revenue is attributed to the following geographic locations based on the physical location of our customers as a percentage of total revenue in the respective periods united states europe asia rest of the world total less than international revenue increased significantly in due to the mdl acquisition  which significantly expanded our life sciences customer base and increased our presence in europe and in japan 
the following table lists our major customers for the years ended december   and and revenue generated from these customers as a percentage of our total revenue in the respective periods 
we expect that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to be generated from a few key customers  though with the mdl acquisition we substantially reduced the concentration of our customer base 
exxonmobil dow total for  we expect dow to be flat to slightly down as a percent of revenue  and expect exxonmobil to account for less than of total revenue due to the may expiration of primary alliance agreement 
we segregate revenue by the following businesses amount in s change over previous year amount in s change over previous year amount in s symyx software symyx hpr total less than the reconciliation of segment revenue above to the revenue disclosed in the consolidated statements of operations is provided in note segment disclosure of notes to consolidated financial statements 
symyx software generates revenue primarily from the licensing of software  including the isentris platform and our lea and electronic laboratory notebook eln products  content subscriptions  and providing associated support  maintenance and consulting services 
symyx software revenue increased from to and again to  driven by products acquired through the mdl acquisition and related services 
symyx hpr generates revenue primarily from providing directed and collaborative research services and selling tools and associated services  and to a lesser extent  licensing materials and intellectual property 
the decrease in symyx hpr revenue in from resulted from the decrease in service revenue  product sales and license fees 
the decrease of symyx hpr service revenue was driven primarily by the expiration of the collaborative research component of our alliance with exxonmobil on may  in addition  the decrease in product sales revenue in compared to was primarily due to customer delays and cancellations in the second half of the year and  to a lesser degree  lower tools revenues for the year from exxon mobil and dow versus the prior year 
during the years ended december   and  we shipped  and tools  respectively  including our core x modules and benchtop products  to chemical  life science  academic and several other customers 

table of contents symyx hpr revenue decreased from to was driven by lower research service revenue due to the expiration of a number of other collaborations 
we launched research services initiatives in the chemical  energy and life science industries in late and mid  respectively  contributing to our revenue 
in august  we acquired integritybio 
while current revenues from these services initiatives are not material  we expect to focus on these services initiatives as key areas of opportunity for growth in research service in however  we can provide no assurances these initiatives will be successful 
prior to its spin out into visyx technologies inc in november  symyx sensors group provided development services and licenses for specific applications of our sensor technology 
symyx sensors revenue in of million primarily consisted of payments received from univation for sensor development services 
for reporting simplicity  we have grouped revenue from symyx sensors group in with revenue from symyx hpr 
costs of revenue we have significantly increased our software consulting and maintenance revenue and the costs associated with these revenue streams 
starting in we reclassified certain operating expenses related to software consulting and software and hardware maintenance as cost of service revenue 
we also reclassified certain operating expenses to costs of revenue related to amortization expenses of intangible assets arising from business combinations that were related to software licensed or product sold 
costs associated with providing contracted research services by integritybio are included in cost of service revenue 
costs associated with providing collaborative research services are included with research and development expenses 
cost of products sold in was million or of product sales revenue  compared to million or of product sales revenue in  and million or of product sales revenue in the fluctuation in the total cost of products sold in the past three years was primarily due to changes in product mix  as well as an inventory excess and obsolete charge of million in primarily due to the delays and cancellations from customers 
cost of products sold as a percentage of product sales revenue in was lower compared to other years due to changes in the product mix shipped in the respective years  and the development costs related to prototypes sold being expensed in prior periods as development costs  as discussed below 
the majority of our tools are built to order or to particular specifications 
we generally charge the development costs incurred prior to the commercial production of these systems to research and development expenses  resulting in a lower cost of products sold and a higher margin for these systems 
therefore  the cost of products sold as a percentage of product sales may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to variability of product mix 
the cost of products sold may also be affected by adjustments to the accrued warranty expense for pre existing sales 
when actual warranty costs are lower than our estimates  the difference will have a favorable impact to cost of products sold at the time the warranty expires for the systems 
when actual warranty costs are anticipated to be higher than our original estimates  an additional expense is charged to cost of products sold in the period when such a determination is made 
in  and  we made favorable adjustments to accrued warranty for pre existing sales of   and  respectively

the decrease in stock based compensation expenses in and was primarily due to the change in our compensation structure toward granting equity awards only to selected key employees and to increases in forfeiture rate assumptions based on actual turnover rates 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our results of operations for the years ended december    and was as follows in thousands costs of revenue research and development sales  general and administrative total research and development r d expenses our r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  facility costs  supplies and depreciation of facilities and laboratory equipment 
the table below indicates the major collaborative partners  defined as those contributing greater than of collaborative research revenue in  for whom we conducted research and development  together with the date upon which the current contract ended or ends and the primary focus of the collaborations 
partner current research contract ends primary focus of current collaborative efforts dow basic and specialty chemicals and materials research exxonmobil catalyst and process development for basic chemicals and refining applications we do not track our fully burdened r d costs or capital expenditures by project 
however  based on hours spent on each project  we estimate the r d efforts were allocated as follows 
table of contents customer sponsored projects internally funded projects total our funded r d efforts as a percentage of total r d efforts decreased significantly due to the expiration of our principal agreement with exxonmobil in may  and to a lesser degree  reduced research efforts provided to dow 
the increase of our r d efforts on internally funded software development projects as a percentage of total r d efforts resulted from the expanded software development workforce from the mdl acquisition 
the increase of r d expenses in over resulted primarily from additional salary related expenses and consulting fees related to the mdl acquisition 
r d expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased in compared to due to the significant increase in revenue driven by the mdl acquisition and the fact that r d as a percentage of revenue is lower in our software business than in our other business lines 
r d expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased in compared to primarily due to the increase in personnel related expenses in the fourth quarter of from the mdl acquisition without a fully corresponding revenue increase  as a significant amount of fourth quarter deferred revenue from mdl was written down as required by purchase accounting rules under us gaap 
innovations and advances generated by our research and development personnel support our symyx software and symyx hpr operations  and generate intellectual property and discovered materials that support our licensing activities 
as a result of the restructuring we implemented in the fourth quarter of  we expect our total r d expense to decline compared to sales  general and administrative sg a expenses our sg a expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales  business development  legal  general management  finance and human resources  as well as payments of commissions to our sales personnel and professional expenses  such as legal and accounting 
the increase in sg a expenses in was primarily due to the increased personnel costs for employees from the mdl acquisition for the full fiscal year 
the increase in sg a expenses in was due to the mdl acquisition and to the increased personnel costs associated with our expanded sales and marketing organizations and the reorganization of our management team 
sg a expenses represented  and of total revenue for years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of total revenue from to was primarily due to annual salary increase and increase in increased expenditures in marketing 
the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of total revenue from to was primarily due to the fact that we could not recognize certain acquisition related mdl deferred revenue under gaap to compensate for the acquisition driven increase in personnel costs 
impairment to goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we performed an impairment analysis in december for all of our business units and determined that the value of our goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets has been impaired primarily due to the significant decline of our market capitalization 
we recorded impairment charge of million  which included million to goodwill  million to intangible assets and million to fixed assets 
restructuring charges on december   in order to realign our operations to drive performance and improve operating efficiency  we implemented a reorganization plan to combine symyx tools and symyx research to create symyx hpr 
the plan included a worldwide reduction in force of approximately employees and the consolidation of certain facilities 
we recorded total restructuring charges of  in the fourth quarter of  consisting of million of severance and one time benefits and million of exit costs of facilities  write off of related fixed assets and associated legal costs 

table of contents acquired in process research and development in october  we acquired mdl in a transaction accounted for as a business combination using the purchase method 
the preliminary purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  including intangible assets  based on their estimated fair values 
the intangible assets include approximately million for acquired in process technology for projects that did not have future alternative uses 
we determined the value of the purchased in process technology using the income approach 
at the date of the mdl acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the technology in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed at the acquisition date in in july  we acquired autodose in a transaction accounted for as a business combination using the purchase method 
the preliminary purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  including intangible assets  based on their estimated fair values 
the intangible assets include approximately million for acquired in process technology for projects that did not have future alternative uses 
we determined the value of the purchased in process technology using the income approach 
at the date of the autodose acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the technology in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed at the acquisition date in amortization of intangible assets arising from business acquisitions in connection with various acquisitions  we have recorded an aggregate of million of intangible assets see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the amortization of intangible assets was recorded partially as costs of revenue and partially as operating expenses depending on the nature of these intangible assets 
gain from sale of equity interest in ilypsa we recorded a million gain in upon the sale of approximately equity interest in ilypsa  inc in the third quarter of  we received another million in cash upon the release of holdback related to the same transaction 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  for the years ended december   and consisted of interest income of approximately  million and million  respectively 
interest income represents interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest income decreased in and due to the significant decrease in our average investment balance after the mdl acquisition and the impact of decreasing average interest rates 
other expense for consisted of million foreign currency losses  partially offset by a million gain from the sale of our occupational health service ohs business in may we recorded a significant amount of foreign currency losses in due to the increased presence of our foreign operations after the mdl acquisition and the material fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates during provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million in  and income tax expenses of million in and million in our effective income tax rate was for  for and for the effective income tax benefit rate was lower than our statutory combined federal and state rate of in due to the non deductibility of the majority of goodwill impairments and a million valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the effective income tax rate was lower than our statutory combined federal and state rate of in due to income tax benefits from research and development credits and tax exempt interest income 
the effective income tax rate for was higher than our statutory rate principally due to the non deductibility of both the in process research and development charge from the autodose acquisition and certain stock based compensation expenses 

table of contents we record income tax expense using the asset and liability method 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between amounts reported for income tax purposes and financial statement purposes  using current tax rates 
we recognize a valuation allowance if we anticipate that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as a result of uncertainties related to the realization of our net deferred tax assets at december  we established the valuation allowance as a result of weighing all positive and negative evidence  including our history of cumulative losses over the past three years and the difficulty of forecasting sufficient future taxable income 
the valuation allowance reflects the conclusion of management that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if the actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the valuation allowance may require adjustment which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
on january   we adopted financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
as a result  we recognized a million increase in liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
as of december   our total unrecognized tax benefits were million  of which million of tax benefits  if recognized  would affect the effective income tax rate 
we do not anticipate the total amounts of unrecognized income tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the next months 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
it also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb issued staff position fsp  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  to fiscal years beginning after november  accordingly  we adopted certain provisions of sfas on january  on a prospective basis for our financial assets and liabilities  which require that we determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy established in sfas we also elected to delay the adoption of sfas for our nonfinancial assets liabilities under fsp until january  and is not expecting the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value  as follows level inputs  which include quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs  which include observable inputs other than level inputs  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability  and level inputs  which include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the underlying asset or liability 
level assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques  as well as significant management judgment or estimation 

table of contents the only type of financial assets to be measured at fair value using level inputs on a recurring basis was our money market funds 
we derived the fair value of our money market funds from quoted market price and measured the fair value of our money market funds using level inputs to be million 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised sfas r  business combinations 
under sfas no 
r  an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date 
it further requires that acquisition related costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred  restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period impact income tax expense 
in addition  acquired in process research and development ipr d is capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over its estimated useful life 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas is based on the economic entity concept of consolidated financial statements  under which all residual economic interest holders in an entity have an equity interest in the consolidated entity  even if the residual interest is relative to only a portion of the entity 
sfas requires that a noncontrolling interest in a consolidated subsidiary be displayed in the consolidated statement of financial position as a separate component of equity because the fasb concluded that noncontrolling interests meet the definition of equity of the consolidated entity 
in addition  net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas is effective for the first annual reporting period on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we do not have any noncontrolling interest as of december  in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is intended to improve financial reporting of derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable financial statement users to better understand the effects of derivatives and hedging on an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
the provisions of sfas are effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after november  we do not anticipate the adoption of sfas will have material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fsp fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fas 
this guidance is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas r when the underlying arrangement includes renewal or extension of terms that would require substantial costs or result in a material modification to the asset upon renewal or extension 
companies estimating the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must now consider their historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements or  in the absence of historical experience  must consider assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension as adjusted for sfas s entity specific factors 
fas is effective for us beginning january  and will impact future business combinations 
liquidity and capital resources this section discusses the effects of the changes in our balance sheets  cash flows and commitments on our liquidity and capital resources 
balance sheet and cash flows we had positive cash flow from operating activities for the year ended december  we ended fiscal year with cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million 
this compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million at december  
table of contents our operating activities provided million and million of cash in and  respectively  and used million of cash in the sources of cash for the three years were primarily the receipt of funding from research partners  payments from product sales and licensing fees 
in we paid approximately million in income taxes  of which the majority was related to the gain from the ilypsa transaction described below 
because this tax payment was recorded against operating cash flow while the original sales proceeds were recorded as investing cash flow  our cash flow from operating activities was negative for our accounts receivable balance at december  decreased significantly compared to december  due to the collection of payments for tools shipped in the fourth quarter of and comparatively lower tools shipments in the fourth quarter of current liabilities increased by approximately million at december  as compared to december  primarily due to the increase in deferred revenue  as our deferred revenues associated with the mdl business returned to more normalized levels 
on october   we completed the acquisition of mdl and reduced mdl s content subscriptions and product support obligations to estimated fair values as of the acquisition date 
to the extent former mdl customers renew these content subscriptions and product support contracts  we will recognize the full value of the content subscriptions and product support contracts as deferred revenues and recognize the related revenue ratably over the contract period 
we currently expect net positive operating cash flow for  but that operating cash flow will be positive or negative in certain quarters  reflecting the seasonality of our businesses 
as a result of adopting sfas r    and million of excess tax benefits for the years ended december   and  respectively  have been classified as an operating cash outflow and a financing cash inflow 
net cash used in investing activities was  and million in and  respectively 
net cash from investing activities was million in included in the cash used in investing activities for were net cash payments for integritybio acquisition of million and an additional investment in intermolecular of million  partially offset by a working capital adjustment in connection with the mdl acquisition and a million from the sale of ilypsa equity interest received in included in the cash from investing activities for were net proceeds of million from marketable securities  proceeds from the sale of ilypsa equity interest of million  partially offset by a net cash payment for mdl acquisition of million 
included in the cash used in investing activities were million for long term investments in intermolecular and visyx and a net of million for the acquisition of autodose 
during  the majority of proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities were re invested in marketable securities 
the other fluctuations from period to period were due primarily to the timing of purchases  sales  and maturities of our marketable securities 
cash used in purchases of property  plant and equipment was million  million and million  respectively  in  and the large amount of cash used in purchases of property  plant and equipment in was primarily associated with the build out of an additional leased facility 
we believe we have built out sufficient facilities spaces for our current business needs  but believe we may incur additional one time charges in facilities consolidation and reconfiguration in the near term to address the ongoing evolution of our businesses 
financing activities provided million and  of cash in and  respectively  and used million of cash in the cash inflows were primarily the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sale of stock under the employee stock purchase plan in each of  and  and for  excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
cash outflows from financing activities in and included approximately  and million  respectively  payment of employee withholding tax in lieu of issuing common stock upon the vest of restricted stock units 
cash outflows in consisted of million of cash used to repurchase our common stock 
on september   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with bank of america  na  as administrative agent and l c issuer the agent  and each lender from time to time a party thereto 
under the credit agreement  the agent has agreed to provide a million aggregate commitment for a two year revolving credit facility and issuances of letters of credit for symyx the facility  secured by substantially all of our assets excluding intellectual property 
as of december   we had no borrowing under the facility 
in the fourth quarter of  due to the non cash impairment charges and valuation allowances recorded  we did not meet the consolidated net worth covenant related to the facility existing default as of december  in march  we entered into an amendment to the facility with the agent which provided a waiver with respect to the existing default and lowered the consolidated net worth covenant amount for future measurement dates 
we believe our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  our bank credit facility  and the cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures  investment requirements  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the next twelve months 
nonetheless  we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot provide assurance that additional funding  if sought  will be available or be on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants which may restrict our business 
collaborative arrangements and licensing may require us to relinquish our rights to some of our technologies or products 
our failure to raise capital when needed  or on terms favorable to us  may harm our business and operating results 

table of contents contractual commitments our contractual commitments consist of our obligations under operating leases facility commitments  our commitments to purchase inventory and fixed assets and services purchase commitments  and our commitments for royalty payments royalty commitments  due when we receive customer payments 
as of december  and  our contractual commitments were million and million  respectively 
the decrease in our contractual commitments in was due to facility lease payments made in  partially offset by commitments from our various new leases 
we expect to satisfy these obligations as they become due over the next eight years 
future principal commitments as of december  were as follows in thousands total less than year years years more than years facility commitments purchase commitments royalty commitments total other commitments as of december   we carried a million accrued liability associated with uncertainties in income taxes 
we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the periods of any cash settlement with the respective tax authorities and have recorded the liability as a long term payable on our consolidated balance sheets 
customer indemnification from time to time  we agree to indemnify our customers against certain third party liabilities  including liability if our products infringe a third party s intellectual property rights 
we account for such indemnification provisions in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
other than for limited exceptions eg  intellectual property indemnity or bodily harm  our indemnification obligation in these arrangements is typically limited to no more than the amount paid by the customer 
as of december   we were not subject to any pending intellectual property related litigation 
we have not received any requests for and have not been required to make any payments under these indemnification provisions during any periods covered in these consolidated financial statements 
contingencies as discussed in note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements  the former stockholders of autodose sa are eligible to receive additional purchase price consideration of up to million swiss franc or equivalent to million using foreign currency exchange rate in effect on december  upon the achievement of certain and revenue targets with respect to our autodose product line 
we evaluate the possibility of achieving these targets from time to time 
if any of the revenue targets are met or are probable to be met  we would record the fair value of any additional consideration as an additional cost of the acquisition 
no additional consideration was recorded as of december  based on our current forecast of revenue from our autodose product line  we do not expect to record any additional consideration during the remainder of 
table of contents pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  the founder of integritybio will earn an additional million in cash  so long as the founder serves as our employee continuously for months from the acquisition date 
we are accruing this liability ratably over the required service period of months 
as of december   we have recorded  long term payable to the founder 
we also agreed to pay of total revenue generated by integritybio during the one year period starting from september  to the founder as an additional consideration pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement 
we will start to accrue the associated additional consideration in the third of quarter of at of the periodic revenue generated by integritybio 
insurance we carry insurance with coverage and coverage limits that we believe to be adequate 
although there can be no assurance that such insurance is sufficient to protect us against all contingencies  our management believes that our insurance protection is reasonable in view of the nature and scope of our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and have not established any special purpose entities as of december  we have not guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities or entered into any options on non financial assets 
dividend policy we have never declared or paid any dividends on our capital stock 
further  under the terms of our credit agreement with bank of america  na  we are restricted from making any cash dividend payments 
we currently expect to retain future earnings  if any  to support the development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we do not use derivative instruments to manage risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings 
we provide our products and services to customers in the united states  europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
sales are primarily made in us dollars  and to a lesser but increasing extent  swiss francs  euros  japanese yens  and british pounds 
a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises in part from inter company accounts with our foreign subsidiaries 
these inter company accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary  and  when re measured and translated in us dollars  have an impact on our operating results depending upon the movement in foreign currency rates 
during fiscal  our total realized and unrealized gains due to movements in foreign currencies  primarily swiss francs  euros  japanese yens  and british pounds was million 
as exchange rates vary  these foreign exchange results may vary and adversely or favorably impact operating results 
an unfavorable change of in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements 
our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash equivalents and marketable investments which have maturities of less than two years 
however  in we maintained our cash in treasury bill money market funds  classified as cash and cash equivalents  and at december  did not have any short term investments 
as a result  we did not have any exposure to interest rate changes 
in we maintained a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  liquid debt securities that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
at december  our investment portfolio was comprised of approximately million in money market funds and million in us corporate debt instruments 
the securities in our investment portfolio were not leveraged  were classified as available for sale and were subject to interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from december  levels  the impact on the fair value of our portfolio would have been insignificant 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
interest rate sensitivity principal amount by expected maturity in thousands average interest rate mature in fair value as of december  marketable securities average interest rate
