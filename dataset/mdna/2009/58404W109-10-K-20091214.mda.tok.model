item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a healthcare provider focused primarily on providing high acuity services  predominantly the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease 
we own and operate hospitals in partnership with physicians whom we believe have established reputations for clinical excellence 
we also have partnerships with community hospital systems  and we manage the cardiovascular program of various hospitals operated by other parties 
we opened our first hospital in and currently have ownership interests in and operate ten hospitals  including eight in which we own a majority interest 
each of our majority owned hospitals is a freestanding  licensed general acute care hospital that provides a wide range of health services with a focus on cardiovascular care 
each of our hospitals has a twenty four hour emergency room staffed by emergency department physicians 
the hospitals in which we have ownership interests have a total of licensed beds and are located predominately in high growth markets in seven states arizona  arkansas  california  louisiana  new mexico  south dakota  and texas 
during may we completed our bed expansion at louisiana medical center and heart hospital  with remaining capacity for an additional beds at that hospital 
during october we opened a new acute care hospital in kingman  arizona 
this hospital is designed to accommodate a total of licensed beds  with an initial opening of of its licensed beds 
in addition to our hospitals  we currently own and or manage cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic facilities or programs 
ten of these programs are located at hospitals operated by other parties 
these facilities offer invasive diagnostic and  in some cases  therapeutic procedures 
the remaining six facilities are not located at hospitals and offer only diagnostic procedures 
we believe our facilities provide superior clinical outcomes  which  together with our ability to provide management capabilities and capital resources  positions us to expand upon our relationships with physicians and community hospitals to increase our presence in existing and new markets 
basis of consolidation 
we have included in our consolidated financial statements hospitals and cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic facilities over which we exercise substantive control  including all entities in which we 
table of contents own more than a interest  as well as variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary 
we have used the equity method of accounting for entities  including variable interest entities  in which we hold less than a interest and over which we do not exercise substantive control  and are not the primary beneficiary 
accordingly  the hospitals in which we hold a minority interest are excluded from the net revenue and operating results of our consolidated company and our consolidated hospital division 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold a portion of our equity interest in harlingen medical center  therefore  beginning in july  we began excluding this hospital from net revenue and operating results of our consolidated company and our consolidated hospital division 
similarly  a number of our diagnostic and therapeutic facilities are excluded from the net revenue and operating results of our consolidated company and our consolidated medcath partners division 
our minority interest in the results of operations for the periods discussed for these entities is recognized as part of the equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in our statements of income in accordance with the equity method of accounting 
we sold our equity interests in heart hospital of lafayette and cape cod cardiology services llc in fiscal and  respectively  and the net assets of dayton heart hospital and sun city cardiac center associates in fiscal and  respectively 
accordingly  for all periods presented  the results of operations for these entities have been excluded from continuing operations and are reported in income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes 
same facility hospitals 
our policy is to include  on a same facility basis  only those facilities that were open and operational during the full current and prior fiscal year comparable periods 
for example  on a same facility basis for our consolidated hospital division for the fiscal year ended september   we exclude the results of operations of harlingen medical center  which  during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the entire fiscal and  ceased to be a consolidated subsidiary due to the sale of a portion of the hospital  as discussed in the basis of consolidation above 
revenue sources by division 
the largest percentage of our net revenue is attributable to our hospital division 
the following table sets forth the percentage contribution of each of our consolidating divisions to consolidated net revenue in the periods indicated below 
year ended september  division hospital medcath partners corporate and other net revenue revenue sources by payor 
we receive payments for our services rendered to patients from the medicare and medicaid programs  commercial insurers  health maintenance organizations  and our patients directly 
generally  our net revenue is determined by a number of factors  including the payor mix  the number and nature of procedures performed and the rate of payment for the procedures 
since cardiovascular disease disproportionately affects those age and older  the proportion of net revenue we derive from the medicare program is higher than that of most general acute care hospitals 
the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net revenue we earned by category of payor in each of our last three fiscal years 
year ended september  payor medicare medicaid commercial and other  including self pay total consolidated net revenue a significant portion of our net revenue is derived from federal and state governmental healthcare programs  including medicare and medicaid  and we expect the net revenue that we receive from the medicare program as a 
table of contents percentage of total consolidated net revenue will remain significant in future periods 
our payor mix may fluctuate in future periods due to changes in reimbursement  market and industry trends with self pay patients and other similar factors 
the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  retroactive and prospective rate adjustments  administrative rulings  court decisions  executive orders and freezes and funding reductions  all of which may significantly affect our business 
in addition  reimbursement is generally subject to adjustment following audit by third party payors  including the fiscal intermediaries who administer the medicare program for cms 
final determination of amounts due providers under the medicare program often takes several years because of such audits  as well as resulting provider appeals and the application of technical reimbursement provisions 
we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might result from these programs  however  due to the complexity of laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs  the manner in which they are interpreted and the other complexities involved in estimating our net revenue  there is a possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
see item business and item a risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis and make changes as experience develops or new information becomes known 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we define critical accounting policies as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine and have the potential to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by governmental programs such as medicare and medicaid and other third party payors such as commercial insurers  health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations are generally less than our established billing rates 
payment arrangements with third party payors may include prospectively determined rates per discharge or per visit  a discount from established charges  per diem payments  reimbursed costs subject to limits and or other similar contractual arrangements 
as a result  net revenue for services rendered to patients is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts as services are rendered 
we account for the difference between the estimated realizable rates under the reimbursement program and the standard billing rates as contractual adjustments 
the majority of our contractual adjustments are system generated at the time of billing based on either government fee schedules or fee schedules contained in our managed care agreements with various insurance plans 
portions of our contractual adjustments are performed manually and these adjustments primarily relate to patients that have insurance plans with whom our hospitals do not have contracts containing discounted fee schedules  also referred to as non contracted payors and patients that have secondary insurance plans following adjudication by the primary payor 
estimates of contractual adjustments are made on a payor specific basis and based on the best information available regarding our interpretation of the applicable laws  regulations and contract terms 
while subsequent adjustments to the systematic contractual allowances can arise due to denials  short payments deemed immaterial for continued collection effort and a variety of other reasons  such amounts have not historically been significant 

table of contents we continually review the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to the laws and regulations and any changes in the contractual terms of our programs 
final settlements under some of these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties  which can take several years to determine 
from a procedural standpoint  for government payors  primarily medicare  we recognize estimated settlements in our consolidated financial statements based on filed cost reports 
we subsequently adjust those settlements as we obtain new information from audits or reviews by the fiscal intermediary and  if the result of the fiscal intermediary audit or review impacts other unsettled and open cost reports  then we recognize the impact of those adjustments 
we estimate current year settlements based on models designed to approximate our cost report filings and revise our estimates in february of each year upon completion of the actual cost report and tentative settlement 
due to the complexity of laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs  the manner in which they are interpreted  and the other complexities involved in estimating our net revenue  there is a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
we provide care to patients who meet certain criteria under our charity care policy without charge or at amounts less than our established rates 
because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care  they are not reported as net revenue 
our managed diagnostic and therapeutic facilities and mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories operate under various contracts where management fee revenue is recognized under fixed rate and percentage of income arrangements as services are rendered 
in addition  certain diagnostic and therapeutic facilities and mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories recognize additional revenue under cost reimbursement and equipment lease arrangements 
net revenue from our owned diagnostic and therapeutic facilities and mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts due from patients  third party payors  and others as services are rendered  including estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third party payors 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients in our hospital division 
the remainder of our accounts receivable principally consist of amounts due from billings to hospitals for various cardiovascular care services performed in our medcath partners division and amounts due under consulting and management contracts 
to provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
we estimate this allowance based on such factors as payor mix  aging and the historical collection experience and write offs of our respective hospitals and other business units 
adverse changes in business office operations  payor mix  economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental healthcare reimbursement could affect our collection of accounts receivable 
when possible  we will attempt to collect co payments from patients prior to admission for inpatient services as a part of the pre registration and registration processes 
if unsuccessful  we will also attempt to reach a mutually agreed upon payment arrangement at that time 
to the extent possible  the estimated amount of the patient s financial responsibility is determined based on the services to be performed  the patient s applicable co payment amount or percentage and any identified remaining deductible and co insurance percentages 
if payment arrangements are not provided upon admission or only a partial payment is obtained  we will attempt to collect any estimated remaining patient balance upon discharge 
we also comply with the requirements under applicable law concerning collection of medicare co payments and deductibles 
patients who come to our hospitals for outpatient services are expected to make payment or adequate financial arrangements before receiving services 
patients who come to the emergency room are screened and stabilized to the extent of the hospital s capability for any emergency medical condition in accordance with applicable laws  rules and other regulations in order that financial arrangements do not delay such screening  stabilization  and appropriate disposition 
general and professional liability risk 
we are self insured for medical malpractice  workers compensation healthcare and dental coverage up to certain maximum liability amounts 
although the amounts accrued are actuarially determined based on analysis of historical trends of losses  settlements  litigation costs and other factors  the amounts we will ultimately disburse could differ from such accrued amounts 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is required to be evaluated for impairment at the same time every year and when an event occurs or circumstances 
table of contents change that  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
a two step method is used for determining if goodwill is impaired 
step one is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit s carrying value  including goodwill 
if this test indicates the fair value is less than the carrying value  then step two is required to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
we have selected september th as our annual testing date 
due to overall market conditions during the first quarter of fiscal resulting in a decline in our market capitalization  we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill as of december  the fair value of the reporting unit our hospital division was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow  market multiple and comparable transaction methods 
these methods are based on our best estimate of future revenues and operating costs  comparable transactions that have taken place in the market place and are reconciled to our market capitalization 
the results of our interim analysis concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value 
we performed our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of september  utilizing the same historical methods as discussed above 
initially our analysis resulted in a fair value for which we could not satisfactorily reconcile to our market capitalization 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our stock price underperformed comparable companies as well as the broader markets  and we also experienced a decline in our fourth quarter operating results 
as a result of these events we placed greater weight on the discounted cash flow method  which resulted in a fair value that was below the carrying value of the reporting unit at september  the second step of the impairment testing process involved the allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit derived in the first step of the impairment test to the fair value of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities 
this process requires significant management estimates and judgments  and is used to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the fair value in excess of amounts allocated to such net assets represented the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit 
as a result goodwill was written down to its implied fair value of zero  derived in the second step  causing the entire balance of million of goodwill to be impaired during the fourth quarter of fiscal the non cash impairment expense did not affect our operations  cash flow  cash position or access to our bank facility 
long lived assets 
long lived assets  which include finite lived intangible assets  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
the determination of whether or not long lived assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of those assets 
changes in our strategy  assumptions and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of long lived assets 
earnings allocated to minority interests 
earnings allocated to minority interests represent the allocation of profits and losses to minority owners in our consolidated subsidiaries 
because our hospitals are owned as joint ventures  each hospital s earnings and losses are generally allocated for accounting purposes to us and our physician and community hospital partners on a pro rata basis in accordance with the respective ownership percentages in the hospital 
if  however  the cumulative net losses of a hospital exceed its initial capitalization and committed capital obligations of our partners  then we recognize a disproportionately higher share  up to  of the hospital s losses  instead of the smaller pro rata share of the losses that normally would be allocated to us based upon our percentage ownership 
the disproportionate allocation to us of a hospital s losses would reduce our consolidated net income in that reporting period 
when the same hospital has earnings in a subsequent period  a disproportionately higher share  up to  of the hospital s earnings will be allocated to us to the extent we have previously recognized a disproportionate share of that hospital s losses 
the disproportionate allocation to us of a hospital s earnings would increase our consolidated net income in that reporting period 
the determination of disproportionate losses to be allocated is based on the specific terms of each hospital s operating agreement  including each partner s contributed capital  obligation to contribute additional capital to provide working capital loans  or to guarantee the outstanding obligations of the hospital 
during each of our fiscal 
table of contents years  and  our disproportionate recognition of earnings and losses in our hospitals had a net positive negative impact of million  million  and million  respectively  on our reported income from continuing operations before income taxes and discontinued operations 
we expect our earnings allocated to minority interests to fluctuate in future periods as we either recognize disproportionate losses and or recoveries thereof through disproportionate profits of our hospitals 
as of september   we have million of cumulative disproportionate losses allocated to us 
we could also be required to recognize disproportionate losses at our other hospitals not currently in a disproportionate allocation position depending on their results of operations in future periods 
income taxes 
income taxes are computed on the pretax income based on current tax law 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences or benefits of differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or their future deductibility is uncertain 
developing the provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
share based compensation compensation expense for share based awards made to employees and directors are recognized based on the estimated fair value of each award over the awards vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using  either an option pricing model for stock options or the closing market value of our stock for restricted stock and restricted stock units  and expense the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the requisite service period in the company s statement of operations 
we calculated the share based compensation expense for each stock option on the date of grant by using a black scholes option pricing model 
the key assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model are the expected life of the stock option  the risk free interest rate and expected volatility 
the expected volatility used in the black scholes option pricing model incorporates historical share price volatility and was based on an analysis of historical prices of our stock 
the expected volatility reflects the historical volatility for a duration consistent with the contractual life of the options 
the expected life of the stock options granted represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free interest rates are based on zero coupon united states treasury yields in effect at the date of grant consistent with the expected exercise timeframes 
stock options awarded to employees are fully vested at the time of grant  with the condition that the optionee is prohibited from selling the share of stock acquired upon exercise of the option for a specified period of time 
as a result  total share based compensation is recorded for stock options on the option grant date 
during fiscal we granted shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees and directors  respectively 
restricted stock granted to employees  excluding executives of the company  vest in equal annual installments over a three year period 
executives of the company defined by us as vice president or higher received two restricted stock grants 
the first grant of restricted stock vests in equal annual installments over a three year period 
the second grant of restricted stock vests over a three year period based on established performance conditions 
restricted stock units granted to directors are fully vested at the date of grant and are paid in the form of common stock upon each applicable director s termination of service on the board

excludes emergency department and our heartsaver ct program 
major diagnostic category mdc corresponds to a circulatory system principal diagnosis 
we have historically referred to mdc procedures as our core procedures 
net revenue increased to million for our fiscal year ended september  from million for our fiscal year ended september  of this million increase in net revenue  our hospital division generated a million increase  our medcath partners division generated a million decrease and our corporate and other division generated a million decrease 
the hospital division increase was comprised of an million increase in net patient revenue and a million increase in other operating revenue 
we continued to experience a shift in inpatient to outpatient procedures in our hospital division during fiscal our inpatient admissions were down for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year  however our outpatient procedures  taking into consideration outpatient visits excluding emergency department visits  increased as a result of the shift from inpatient to outpatient procedures 
our emergency department visits increased during fiscal compared to fiscal  driven primarily by our expansion and marketing efforts 
total outpatient net patient revenue excluding emergency department and our heart saver program net revenue increased from of total hospital net revenue for fiscal to for fiscal during we established a consolidated primary care physician group at one of our hospitals 
net revenue for fiscal includes million related to this new group 
the related expenses are also reported as a component of income from operations 
our net revenue was positively impacted by an overall decrease in deductions for uncompensated care of or million 
we commonly refer to these deductions as charity care 
charity care was million for 
table of contents fiscal compared to million for fiscal charity care is recorded for patients that meet certain federal poverty guidelines and request charity consideration in line with our policy 
the number of patients that qualified for charity care decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal and  we recognized net negative contractual adjustments to our net revenue of million and million  respectively  related to the filing of prior years medicare cost reports as well as other medicare and medicaid settlement adjustments 
therefore  these adjustments had a year over year negative impact of million to net revenue 
personnel expense 
personnel expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  personnel expense remained flat at for the comparable periods 
we recognized share based compensation expense of million and million for the fiscal years ended september and  respectively 
the million decrease in share based compensation expense was offset by an increase in personnel expense related to cost of living wage adjustments made during the first quarter of fiscal and an increase in our hospital division benefit costs related to our self insured medical plan due to an increase in employee related medical claims during fiscal medical supplies expense 
medical supplies expense increased to million  or of net revenue  for fiscal from million  or of net revenue  for fiscal we experienced an increase in expense related to aicd s  heart valves  drug eluting stents and vascular graft supplies during fiscal offset by a reduction in expense for bare metal stents  orthopedic and chargeable medical supplies 
the increase in aicd s  heart valves  drug eluting stents and vascular graft supplies was directly related to a combination of a higher utilization of supplies per procedure  an increase in the number of procedures performed or the use of higher cost supplies for these procedures 
conversely  the reduction in bare metal stents and orthopedic supplies is the direct result of lower utilization of supplies per procedure and lower cost for the units used per procedure 
bad debt expense 
bad debt expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal total uncompensated care  which includes charity care deductions recorded as a reduction to patient revenue and bad debt expense  was million for fiscal  or of hospital division net patient revenue  compared to million  or of hospital division net patient revenue for fiscal we have experienced an increase in bad debt expense primarily related to an increase in the uncollectibility of the self pay balance after insurance and a reduction in patients that qualify for charity care and or government assistance 
the reduction in total uncompensated care to net revenue is due to improved collections during fiscal our days sales outstanding were for fiscal compared to for fiscal same facility basis 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase is mainly driven by clinical and non clinical contract services due to the growth in volume at several of our facilities  particularly emergency department visits  as well as increased maintenance costs at our hospitals as machinery warranties have expired at several of our facilities 
these increases have been offset by a decline in administrative contract services and collection agency fees as these services are brought in house to control costs and gain efficiencies 
in addition  we incurred a million increase in costs related to a new primary care physician group at one of our hospitals 
we also incurred million in penalty expense for the anticipated settlement of regulatory claims at two of our hospitals related to the identification  return and self reporting of million in reimbursement for certain procedures performed at those hospitals in prior fiscal years  million in professional fees associated with an internal assessment of certain controls and procedures completed during the quarter and million in severance fees for fiscal however  these expenses were offset by lower corporate and other and partner division costs for medical claims and decreased salaries and wages related to a reduction of employees in the partners division 
pre opening expenses 
we incurred approximately million and million in pre opening expenses during fiscal and pre opening expenses represent costs specifically related to projects under development 
as of september  and  we had one hospital under development  hualapai medical center in kingman  arizona  which opened on october  the amount of pre opening expenses  if any  we incur in future periods will depend on the nature  timing and size of our development activities 

table of contents depreciation 
depreciation increased to million for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  the increase in depreciation is the direct result of expansion at several of our facilities as well as the purchase of newer computer equipment to replace outdated hardware 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this million decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to the overall reduction in our outstanding debt  a decrease in the interest rate on our outstanding debt  and the capitalization of interest on our capital expansion projects 
capitalized interest was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal loss on early extinguishment of debt 
during december  we redeemed all of our outstanding senior notes for million  which included the payment of a repurchase premium of million and accrued interest of million 
the senior notes were redeemed through borrowings under the senior secured credit facility and available cash on hand 
in addition  we incurred million in expenses related to the write off of previously incurred financing costs associated with the senior notes 
there was no loss on early extinguishment of debt for fiscal interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease is a result of the decrease in cash balances and the decrease in interest earned on cash balances during fiscal equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is attributable to a million growth in earnings for our unconsolidated affiliates related to our partners division offset by a reduction of million related to the hospital division 
the increase for our partners division is the result of a new minority owned venture that had a full year of operations in fiscal the decline for our hospital division is the result of an overall net decrease in income from our two minority owned hospitals 
minority interest share of earnings of consolidated subsidiaries 
minority interest share of earnings of consolidated subsidiaries decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decline is the result of an overall net decrease in income before minority interest of certain of our established hospitals 
we expect our earnings allocated to minority interests to fluctuate in future periods as we either recognize disproportionate losses and or recoveries thereof through disproportionate profit recognition 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  which represented an effective tax rate of and  respectively 
the fiscal effective rate is below our federal statutory rate of primarily due to the non deductibility for income tax purposes of a majority of the million impairment expense related to goodwill 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes 
income from discontinued operations  net of taxes  reflects the results of dayton heart hospital  cape cod cardiology services llc  sun city cardiac center associates and the heart hospital of lafayette for fiscal and fiscal net income from discontinued operations was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal income from discontinued operations  net of taxes  includes the gains on the sale of cape cod cardiology services llc and sun city cardiac center associates for fiscal offset by operating losses of other discontinued entities 
income from discontinued operations  net of taxes  for fiscal includes the gain recorded as a result of the sale of certain assets of dayton heart hospital offset by operating losses of dayton heart hospital prior to the sale

as part of the recapitalization  our ownership in harlingen medical center was reduced from a majority ownership of to a minority ownership of 
due to this change in ownership  we began accounting for harlingen medical center as an equity investment at the beginning of the fiscal quarter ended september  as opposed to including harlingen medical center in our consolidated results of operations 
as such  our fiscal year and our fourth quarter of fiscal consolidated results exclude the financials results of harlingen medical center 
the following management discussion and analysis focuses on same facility results of operations and  therefore  excludes harlingen medical center from the results of both fiscal and fiscal when appropriate 

table of contents net revenue 
net revenue decreased to million for our fiscal year ended september  from million for our fiscal year ended september  of this million decrease in net revenue  our hospitals generated a million decrease  our medcath partners division generated a million decrease  our cardiology consulting and management operations generated a million increase  and our corporate and other division generated a million decrease 
on a same facility basis our net revenue increased million  or from the prior fiscal year 
we experienced a shift in inpatient to outpatient procedures during fiscal on a same facility basis our admissions were down for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year  however our adjusted admissions  which take into consideration outpatient visits  increased as a result of the shift from inpatient to outpatient procedures 
during fiscal we experienced an increase in net revenues of and from outpatient drug eluting stents and bare metal stents  respectively  when compared to fiscal net revenue from inpatient drug eluting stents and bare metal stents were down and  respectively  on a same facility basis in fiscal compared to fiscal our net revenue has been negatively impacted by an overall increase in deductions for uncompensated care 
we commonly refer to these deductions as charity care 
charity care was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal charity care is recorded for patients that meet certain federal poverty guidelines 
the number of patients that qualified for charity care increased during fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  we recognized net negative contractual adjustments to our net revenue of million related to the filing of our medicare cost reports as well as other medicare and medicaid settlement adjustments 
further  the fiscal year ended september  was negatively impacted as a result of recording a million reduction in net revenue for a portion of certain federal healthcare billings reimbursed in prior years 
see note contingencies and commitments of our consolidated financial statements 
in contrast  we recognized negative contractual adjustments to our net revenue of million during fiscal related to our medicare cost reports and other medicare and medicaid settlement adjustments for prior fiscal periods 
personnel expense 
personnel expense decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  personnel expense increased to from for the comparable periods 
on a same facility basis  personnel expense increased to of net revenue for the fiscal year ended september  from for the fiscal year ended september  this increase is mainly due to cost of living wage adjustments made during the first quarter of fiscal and an increase in labor costs due to the continued demand for nurses and other technicians in several of our markets 
we recognized share based compensation of million and million for the fiscal year ended september and  respectively 
medical supplies expense 
medical supplies expense decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal medical supplies expense on a same facility basis increased slightly to from as a percentage of net revenue for the fiscal year ending september  compared to the fiscal year ending september  medical supplies expense as a percentage of adjusted admission has remained flat on a same facility basis year over year 
bad debt expense 
bad debt expense decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal same facility bad debt expense increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal same facility bad debt expense also increased to of net revenue for the fiscal year ending september  compared to for the fiscal year ended september  due to a decrease in payments and write offs as a percentage of patient billings 
we have experienced an unfavorable trend regarding the collection of the portion of the amount due from patients after insurance and a decrease in the number of patients that qualify for medicaid 

table of contents other operating expenses 
other operating expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal same facility other operating expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal we continue to see an increase in contract services due to the growth in volume at several of our facilities as well as increased maintenance costs at our hospitals as machinery warranties have expired at several of our facilities 
pre opening expenses 
we incurred approximately million and million in pre opening expenses during fiscal and pre opening expenses represent costs specifically related to projects under development  primarily new hospitals

cardiovascular procedures can often be scheduled ahead of time  permitting some 
table of contents patients to choose to undergo the procedure at a time and location of their preference 
some of the types of trends that we have experienced in the past and may experience again in the future include the markets where some of our hospitals are located are susceptible to seasonal population changes with part time residents living in the area only during certain months of the year  patients choosing to schedule procedures around significant dates  such as holidays  and physicians in the market where a hospital is located schedule vacation from their practice during the summer months of the year  around holidays and for various professional meetings held throughout the world during the year 
to the extent these types of events occur in the future  as in the past  we expect they will affect the quarterly results of operations of our hospitals 
liquidity and capital resources working capital and cash flow activities 
our consolidated working capital was million at september  and million at september  the decrease of million in working capital primarily resulted from cash outflows for capital expenditures as a result of our hospital expansions  the repurchase of our senior notes  and the payment of federal and state income taxes offset by cash flows from operations 
at september  million of cash was restricted and held in escrow as required by the city of kingman  arizona in conjunction with the company s development of the hualapai mountain medical center 
the escrowed funds were released during the fourth quarter of fiscal upon our completion of the common infrastructure construction projects affecting the city of kingman 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we were informed by one of our medicare fiscal intermediaries that outlier payments received prior to january  would not be disputed  therefore  we reversed million that was originally recorded to account for outlier payments that had been received in at september  and  we carried a reserve of million and million  respectively  for the outlier payments received in the cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million and million for the years ending september  and  respectively 
the million increase is primarily attributed to the decrease in federal and state income tax payments made during fiscal compared to fiscal  offset by cash flows from operations

in addition the company may have recorded off setting assets associated with these guarantees  see note in addition  we have million in unrecognized tax benefits 
during november  we amended and restated our senior secured credit facility the amended credit facility 
the amended credit facility provides for a three year term loan facility in the amount of million the term loan and a revolving credit facility in the amount of million the revolver  which includes a million sub limit for the issuance of stand by and commercial letters of credit and a million sub limit for swing line loans

borrowings under the amended credit facility  excluding swing line loans  bear interest per annum at a rate equal to the sum of libor plus the applicable margin or the alternate base rate plus the applicable margin 
the amended credit facility continues to be guaranteed jointly and severally by us and certain of our existing and future  direct and indirect  wholly owned subsidiaries and continues to be secured by a first priority perfected security interest in all of the capital stock or other ownership interests owned by us and our subsidiary guarantors in each of their subsidiaries  and  subject to certain exceptions in the credit facility  all other present and future assets and properties of the medcath and the subsidiary guarantors and all intercompany notes

table of contents during december we redeemed our outstanding senior notes the senior notes issued by medcath holdings corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of us  for million  which included the payment of a repurchase premium of million and accrued interest of million 
the senior notes were redeemed through borrowings under the amended credit facility and available cash on hand 
in addition to the aforementioned repurchase premium we incurred million in expense related to the write off of previously incurred financing costs associated with the senior notes 
the repurchase premium and write off of previously incurred financing costs have been included in the consolidated statement of income as loss on early extinguishment of debt 
at september   we had million of outstanding debt  million of which was classified as current 
of the outstanding debt  million was outstanding under our amended credit facility  million was outstanding to various lenders to our hospitals  and the remaining million of debt was outstanding to lenders for medcath partners diagnostic services under capital leases 
of the million outstanding under our amended credit facility  million was outstanding under the revolver 
the maximum availability under the revolver is million which is reduced by the aforementioned outstanding borrowings under the revolver and outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
covenants related to our long term debt restrict the payment of dividends and require the maintenance of specific financial ratios and amounts and periodic financial reporting 
at september   texsan heart hospital was in violation of financial covenants which govern its equipment loans outstanding 
accordingly  the total outstanding balance of million for these loans has been included in the current portion of long term debt and obligations under capital leases in our consolidated balance sheet for fiscal the covenant violations did not result in any other non compliance related to the covenants governing our other outstanding debt arrangements 
at september   we guaranteed either all or a portion of the obligations of our subsidiary hospitals for equipment and other notes payable 
we provide these guarantees in accordance with the related hospital operating agreements  and we receive a fee for providing these guarantees from the hospitals or the physician investors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of the terms  covenants and repayment schedule surrounding our debt 
we believe that internally generated cash flows and available borrowings under our amended credit facility will be sufficient to finance our business plan  capital expenditures and our working capital requirements for the next to months 
intercompany financing arrangements 
we provide secured real estate  equipment and working capital financings to our majority owned hospitals 
the aggregate amount of the intercompany real estate  equipment and working capital and other loans outstanding as of september  and were million and million  respectively 
each intercompany real estate loan is separately documented and secured with a lien on the borrowing hospital s real estate  building and equipment and certain other assets 
each intercompany real estate loan typically matures in to years and accrues interest at variable rates based on libor plus an applicable margin or a fixed rate similar to terms commercially available 
each intercompany equipment loan is separately documented and secured with a lien on the borrowing hospital s equipment and certain other assets 
amounts borrowed under the intercompany equipment loans are payable in monthly installments of principal and interest over terms that range from to years 
the intercompany equipment loans accrue interest at rates ranging from to 
the weighted average interest rate for the intercompany equipment loans at september  was 
we typically receive a fee from the minority partners in the subsidiary hospitals as consideration for providing these intercompany real estate and equipment loans 
we also use intercompany financing arrangements to provide cash support to individual hospitals for their working capital and other corporate needs 
we provide these working capital loans pursuant to the terms of the operating agreements between our physician and hospital investor partners and us at each of our hospitals 
these intercompany loans are evidenced by promissory notes that establish borrowing limits and provide for a market rate of interest to be paid to us on outstanding balances 
these intercompany loans are subordinate to each hospital s 
table of contents mortgage and equipment debt outstanding  but are senior to our equity interests and our partners equity interests in the hospital venture and are secured  subject to the prior rights of the senior lenders  in each instance by a pledge of certain of the borrowing hospital s assets 
also as part of our intercompany financing and cash management structure  we sweep cash from individual hospitals as amounts are available in excess of the individual hospital s working capital needs 
these funds are advanced pursuant to cash management agreements with the individual hospital that establish the terms of the advances and provide for a rate of interest to be paid consistent with the market rate earned by us on the investment of its funds 
these cash advances are due back to the individual hospital on demand and are subordinate to our equity investment in the hospital venture 
as of september  and  we held million and million  respectively  of intercompany working capital and other notes and related accrued interest  net of advances from our hospitals 
because these intercompany notes receivable and related interest income are eliminated with the corresponding notes payable and interest expense at our consolidating hospitals in the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements the amounts outstanding under these notes do not appear in our consolidated financial statements or accompanying notes 
information about the aggregate amount of these notes outstanding from time to time may be helpful  however  in understanding the amount of our total investment in our hospitals 
in addition  we believe investors and others will benefit from a greater understanding of the significance of the priority rights we have under these intercompany notes receivable to distributions of cash by our hospitals as funds are generated from future operations  a potential sale of a hospital  or other sources 
because these notes receivable are senior to the equity interests of medcath and our partners in each hospital  in the event of a sale of a hospital  the hospital would be required first to pay to us any balance outstanding under its intercompany notes prior to distributing any of the net proceeds of the sale to any of the hospital s equity investors as a return on their investment based on their pro rata ownership interests 
also  appropriate payments to us to amortize principal balances outstanding and to pay interest due under these notes are generally made to us from a hospital s available cash flows prior to any pro rata distributions of a hospital s earnings to the equity investors in the hospitals 
off balance sheet arrangements 
the company s off balance sheet arrangements consist of guarantees of consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiary equipment loans and operating leases that are reflected in the table above and as discussed in notes and  respectively  in the consolidated financial statements 
reimbursement  legislative and regulatory changes legislative and regulatory action has resulted in continuing changes in reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs that will continue to limit payments we receive under these programs 
within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are substantial areas subject to legislative and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations  and discretion which may further affect payments made under those programs  and the federal and state governments may  in the future  reduce the funds available under those programs or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of our hospitals or require other changes in our operations 
additionally  there may be a continued rise in managed care programs and future restructuring of the financing and delivery of healthcare in the united states 
these events could have an adverse effect on our future financial results 
see item a risk factors reductions or changes in reimbursement from government or third party payors could adversely impact our operating results 
inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages  such as the growing nationwide shortage of qualified nurses  occur in the marketplace 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we have implemented cost control measures  including our case and resource management program  to curb increases in operating costs and expenses 
we have  to date  offset increases in operating costs by increasing reimbursement for services and expanding services 
however  we cannot predict our ability to cover  or offset  future cost increases 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain a policy for managing risk related to exposure to variability in interest rates  commodity prices  and other relevant market rates and prices which includes considering entering into derivative instruments freestanding derivatives  or contracts or instruments containing features or terms that behave in a manner similar to derivative instruments embedded derivatives in order to mitigate our risks 
in addition  we may be required to hedge some or all of our market risk exposure  especially to interest rates  by creditors who provide debt funding to us 
currently one of our hospitals in which we have a minority interest and account for under the equity method entered into an interest rate swap during fiscal for purposes of hedging variable interest payments on long term debt outstanding for that hospital 
the interest rate swap is accounted for as a cash flow hedge by the hospital whereby changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap flow through comprehensive income of the hospital 
potential losses of earnings and cash flows due to the market risk of the aforementioned interest rate swap are immaterial 
interest rate risk our amended credit facility borrowings expose us to risks caused by fluctuations in the underlying interest rates 
the total outstanding balance of our amended credit facility was million at september  a change of basis points in the underlying interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately million during the fiscal year ended september
