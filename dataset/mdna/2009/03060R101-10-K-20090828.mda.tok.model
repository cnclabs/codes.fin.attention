item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading independent auto finance company specializing in purchasing retail automobile installment sales contracts originated by franchised and select independent dealers in connection with the sale of used and new automobiles 
we generate revenue and cash flows primarily through the purchase  retention  subsequent securitization and servicing of finance receivables 
as used herein  loans include auto finance receivables originated by dealers and purchased by us 
to fund the acquisition of receivables prior to securitization  we use available cash and borrowings under our credit facilities 
we earn finance charge income on the finance receivables and pay interest expense on borrowings under our credit facilities 
through wholly owned subsidiaries  we periodically transfer receivables to securitization trusts trusts that issue asset backed securities to investors 
we retain an interest in these securitization transactions in the form of restricted cash accounts and overcollateralization  whereby more receivables are transferred to the trusts than the amount of asset backed securities issued by the trusts  as well as the estimated future excess cash flows expected to be received by us over the life of the securitization 
excess cash flows result from the difference between the finance charges received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to investors in the asset backed securities  net of credit losses and expenses 
excess cash flows from the trusts are initially utilized to fund credit enhancement requirements in order to attain specific credit ratings for the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
once targeted credit enhancement requirements are reached and maintained  excess cash flows are distributed to us or  in a securitization utilizing a senior subordinated structure  may be used to accelerate the repayment of certain subordinated securities 
in addition to excess cash flows  we receive monthly base servicing fees and we collect other fees  such as late charges  as servicer for securitization trusts 
for securitization transactions that involve the purchase of a financial guaranty insurance policy  credit enhancement requirements will increase if specified portfolio performance ratios are exceeded 
excess cash flows otherwise distributable to us from trusts in which the portfolio performance ratios were exceeded and from other trusts which may be subject to limited cross collateralization provisions are accumulated in the trusts until such higher levels of credit enhancement are reached and maintained 
senior subordinated securitizations typically do not utilize portfolio performance ratios 
we structure our securitization transactions as secured financings 
accordingly  following a securitization  the finance receivables and the related securitization notes payable remain on the consolidated balance sheets 
we recognize finance charge and fee income on the receivables and interest expense on the securities issued in the securitization transaction and record a provision for loan losses to cover probable loan losses on the receivables 
prior to october   our securitization transactions were structured as sales of finance receivables 
in connection with the acquisitions described below  we also acquired two securitization trusts which were accounted for as sales of finance receivables 
receivables sold under this structure are referred to herein as gain on sale receivables 
at june   we had no outstanding gain on sale securitizations 
on may   we acquired the stock of bay view acceptance corporation bvac 
bvac served auto dealers in states offering specialized auto finance products  including extended term financing and higher loan to value advances to consumers with prime credit bureau scores 
on january   we acquired the stock of long beach acceptance corporation lbac 
lbac served auto dealers in states offering auto finance products primarily to consumers with near prime credit bureau scores 

table of contents the operations of bvac and lbac have been integrated into our origination  servicing and administrative activities and we provide auto finance products solely under the americredit financial services  inc name 
throughout calendar and the first half of calendar  we continually revised our operating plans in an effort to preserve and strengthen our capital and liquidity position and to maintain sufficient capacity on our credit facilities to fund new loan originations until capital market conditions improve for securitization transactions 
under these revised plans  we increased the minimum credit score requirements and tightened loan structures for new loan originations  decreased our originations infrastructure by closing and consolidating credit center locations  selectively decreased the number of dealers from whom we purchase loans and reduced originations and support function headcount 
we have discontinued new originations in our direct lending  leasing and specialty prime platforms  certain partner relationships  and in canada 
our origination levels were reduced to million for the three months ended june   compared to million for the three months ended june  we completed a securitization transaction in july and used the proceeds primarily to repay borrowings under our credit facilities 
as a result  we have greater unused borrowing capacity on our credit facilities and we are seeking to modestly increase origination levels in fiscal from our annualized originations levels for the three months ended june  critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of revenue and costs and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates and those differences may be material 
the accounting estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established systematically based on the determination of the amount of probable credit losses inherent in the finance receivables as of the reporting date 
we review charge off experience factors  delinquency reports  historical collection rates  estimates of the value of the underlying collateral  economic trends  such as unemployment rates  and other information in order to make the necessary judgments as to the probable credit losses 
we also use historical charge off experience to determine a loss confirmation period  which is defined as the time between when an event  such as delinquency status  giving rise to a probable credit loss occurs with respect to a specific account and when such account is charged off 
this loss confirmation period is applied to the forecasted probable credit losses to determine the amount of losses inherent in finance receivables at the reporting date 
assumptions regarding credit losses and loss confirmation periods are reviewed periodically and may be impacted by actual performance of finance receivables and changes in any of the factors discussed above 
should the credit loss assumption or loss confirmation period increase  there would be an increase in the amount of allowance for loan losses required  which would decrease the net carrying value of finance receivables and increase the amount of provision for loan losses recorded on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive operations 
a and increase in cumulative net credit losses over the loss confirmation period would increase the allowance for loan losses as of june   as follows in thousands adverse change adverse change impact on allowance for loan losses we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable losses inherent in our receivables  however  because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge off amount will not exceed such estimates or that our credit loss assumptions will not increase 

table of contents income taxes we are subject to income tax in the united states and canada 
in the ordinary course of our business  there may be transactions  calculations  structures and filing positions where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
at any point in time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions and we record liabilities for estimated tax results based on the requirements of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin accounting standards codification asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement management believes that the estimates its uses are reasonable 
however  due to expiring statutes of limitations  audits  settlements  changes in tax law or new authoritative rulings  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will be comparable to what was reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we may need to adjust our accrued tax assets or liabilities if actual results differ from estimated results or if we adjust these assumptions in the future  which could materially impact the effective tax rate  earnings  accrued tax balances and cash 
as a part of our financial reporting process  we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered 
unless recovery is more likely than not  the provision for income taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets 
in this process  certain criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses  credit carrybacks  estimated taxable income in future years and the duration of the carryforward periods 
we incurred a significant taxable loss for fiscal for us tax purposes  we can carryback approximately million of taxable losses for fiscal to offset taxes paid in fiscal and any remaining us net operating loss can be carried forward for years 
we expect to fully utilize this asset over the carryforward period 
in contrast to us federal tax rules  there is generally no carryback potential for the majority of us state tax jurisdictions and the various state carryforward periods range from to years 
we have established a valuation allowance against a portion of our state tax net operating loss 
our judgment regarding future taxable income may change due to evolving corporate and operational strategies  market conditions  changes in us  state or international tax laws and other factors which may later alter our judgment of the utilization of these assets 
during fiscal  the company experienced an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code 
in general under section  an ownership change is defined as an increase in ownership of certain shareholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
under section  following an ownership change  special limitations apply to the use by a loss corporation of its i net operating loss carryforwards arising before the ownership change and ii net unrealized built in losses 
the company does not believe that the ownership change significantly impacts the ability to utilize its existing net operating losses

the provision for loan losses recorded for fiscal and reflects inherent losses on receivables originated during those periods and changes in the amount of inherent losses on receivables originated in prior periods 
the provision for loan losses increased to  million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a result of weaker credit performance from the lbac portfolio and sub prime loans originated in calendar years and as well as higher expected future losses due to weaker economic conditions  particularly in certain geographic areas  including florida and southern california

credit quality we provide financing in relatively high risk markets  and  therefore  anticipate a corresponding high level of delinquencies and charge offs 
the following tables present certain data related to the receivables portfolio dollars in thousands june  june  principal amount of receivables  net of fees nonaccretable acquisition fees allowance for loan losses receivables  net number of outstanding contracts average carrying amount of outstanding contract in dollars allowance for loan losses and nonaccretable acquisition fees as a percentage of receivables 
table of contents the allowance for loan losses and nonaccretable acquisition fees as a percentage of receivables increased to as of june   from as of june   as a result of higher expected future losses due to weaker economic conditions  an increase in the average age or seasoning of the portfolio and lower expected recovery rates on repossessed collateral 
delinquency the following is a summary of finance receivables that are i more than days delinquent  but not yet in repossession  and ii in repossession  but not yet charged off dollars in thousands june  june  amount percent amount percent delinquent contracts to days greater than days in repossession an account is considered delinquent if a substantial portion of a scheduled payment has not been received by the date such payment was contractually due 
delinquencies in our managed receivables portfolio may vary from period to period based upon the average age or seasoning of the portfolio  seasonality within the calendar year and economic factors 
due to our target customer base  a relatively high percentage of accounts become delinquent at some point in the life of a loan and there is a high rate of account movement between current and delinquent status in the portfolio 
delinquencies in finance receivables were higher at june   as compared to june   as a result of weaker economic conditions and an increase in the average age or seasoning of the portfolio 
deferrals in accordance with our policies and guidelines  we  at times  offer payment deferrals to consumers  whereby the consumer is allowed to move up to two delinquent payments to the end of the loan generally by paying a fee approximately the interest portion of the payment deferred  except where state law provides for a lesser amount 
our policies and guidelines limit the number and frequency of deferments that may be granted 
additionally  we generally limit the granting of deferments on new accounts until a requisite number of payments have been received 
due to the nature of our customer base and policies and guidelines of the deferral program  which policies and guidelines have not changed materially in several years  approximately of accounts historically comprising the portfolio receive a deferral at some point in the life of the account 
an account for which all delinquent payments are cleared through a deferment transaction  which may include installment payments  is classified as current at the time the deferment is granted and therefore is not included as a delinquent account 
thereafter  such account is aged based on the timely payment of future installments in the same manner as any other account 
contracts receiving a payment deferral as an average quarterly percentage of average receivables outstanding were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
deferment levels were higher in fiscal than in prior years as weaker economic conditions resulted in more eligible consumers requesting and being granted deferments 

table of contents the following is a summary of total deferrals as a percentage of receivables outstanding june  june  never deferred deferred times times greater than times total deferred total we evaluate the results of our deferment strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred versus the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time 
based on this evaluation  we believe that payment deferrals granted according to our policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio 
changes in deferment levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of finance receivables charged off by us 
however  the timing of a charge off may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a charge off 
to the extent that deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is charged off  historical charge off ratios and loss confirmation periods used in the determination of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses are also impacted 
increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period  which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and therefore increase the allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses 
changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses 
charge offs the following table presents charge off data with respect to our finance receivables portfolio dollars in thousands years ended june  finance receivables repossession charge offs less recoveries mandatory charge offs a net charge offs net charge offs as a percentage of average receivables recoveries as a percentage of gross repossession charge offs a mandatory charge offs represent accounts days delinquent that are charged off in full with no recovery amounts realized at time of charge off and the net write down of finance receivables in repossession to the net realizable value of the repossessed vehicle when the repossessed vehicle is legally available for sale 
net charge offs as a percentage of average receivables outstanding may vary from period to period based upon the average age or seasoning of the portfolio and economic factors 
the increase in net charge offs through fiscal  as a percentage of average receivables  as compared to fiscal  was a result of weaker economic conditions  an increase in the average age or seasoning of the portfolio and a decline in wholesale auction values for used cars 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general our primary sources of cash have been finance charge income  servicing fees  distributions from securitization trusts  net proceeds from senior notes and convertible senior notes transactions  borrowings under credit facilities  transfers of finance receivables to trusts in securitization transactions and collections and recoveries on finance receivables 
our primary uses of cash have been purchases of finance receivables  repayment of credit facilities  securitization notes payable and other indebtedness  funding credit enhancement requirements for securitization transactions and credit facilities  repurchases of unsecured debt  operating expenses  and income taxes 
we used cash of  million   million and  million for the purchase of finance receivables during fiscal  and  respectively 
these purchases were funded initially utilizing cash and borrowings under credit facilities and our strategy is to subsequently obtain long term financing for finance receivables in securitization transactions 
credit facilities in the normal course of business  in addition to using our available cash  we pledge receivables to and borrow under our credit facilities to fund our operations and repay these borrowings as appropriate under our cash management strategy 
as of june   credit facilities consisted of the following in millions facility type maturity a facility amount advances outstanding master warehouse facility march  medium term note facility october prime near prime facility b lease warehouse facility c a because the facilities are non recourse to us  the outstanding debt balance at maturity will generally be repaid over time based on the amortization of receivables pledged 
b in april  the prime near prime facility was amended to end the revolving period and the outstanding debt balance will be repaid over time based on the amortization of the receivables pledged 
c in june  the lease warehouse facility was amended to end the revolving period and to provide for quarterly payments of approximately million until april when the facility will be repaid in full 
in march  we amended and extended our master warehouse facility 
the amendment  which was approved by all ten active lenders in the facility  reduced the size of the facility to  million from  million  and extended the revolving period to march from october in march when the revolving period ends  the outstanding balance will be repaid over time based on the amortization of the receivables pledged until april when the remaining balance will be due and payable 
we also amended certain covenants under the facility  including i increasing the maximum rolling six month annualized portfolio net loss ratio to through october  through december  through march and thereafter  ii removing the day aging limitation on pledged receivables and iii lowering the minimum interest coverage requirement to times earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  except for the september  december and march quarters  when it is times earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in conjunction with the amendment  the advance rate on the master warehouse facility declined immediately from approximately to approximately and will gradually decrease to approximately by february in may  we reduced the facility size to  million from  million and we further reduced the facility size in july to  million to align our borrowing capacity with our origination levels 

table of contents also in march  we amended the rolling six month annualized portfolio net loss ratio covenant in our medium term note facility to levels consistent with changes in the master warehouse facility 
in october  when the revolving period ends  the outstanding balance will be repaid over time based on the amortization of the receivables pledged until october when any remaining amount will be due and payable 
our credit facilities contain various covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios  asset quality and portfolio performance ratios portfolio net loss and delinquency ratios  and pool level cumulative net loss ratios as well as limits on deferment levels

convertible senior notes in september  we issued million of convertible senior notes of which million are due in  bearing interest at a rate of per annum  and million are due in  bearing interest at a rate of per annum 
interest on the notes is payable semiannually 
subject to certain conditions  the notes  which are uncollateralized  may be converted prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share and per share for the notes due in and  respectively 
upon conversion  the conversion value will be paid in cash equal to the principal amount of the notes and to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the notes  shares of our common stock 
the notes are convertible only in the following circumstances if the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price during specified periods set forth in the indentures under which the notes were issued  if the average trading price per  principal amount of the notes is less than or equal to of the average conversion value of the notes during specified periods set forth in the indentures under which the notes were issued or upon the occurrence of specific corporate transactions set forth in the indentures under which the notes were issued 
in connection with the issuance of these convertible senior notes  we used net proceeds of million to purchase  shares of our common stock 
in conjunction with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  we purchased call options that entitle us to purchase shares of our common stock in an amount equal to the number of shares issued upon conversion of the notes at per share and per share for the notes due in and  respectively 
these call options are expected to allow us to offset the dilution of our shares if the conversion feature of the convertible senior notes is exercised 

table of contents we also sold warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share and  shares of our common stock at per share for the notes due in and  respectively 
in no event are we required to deliver a number of shares in connection with the exercise of these warrants in excess of twice the aggregate number of shares initially issuable upon the exercise of the warrants 
we have analyzed the conversion feature  call option and warrant transactions under emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company s own stock asc  and determined they meet the criteria for classification as equity transactions 
as a result  both the cost of the call options and the proceeds of the warrants are reflected in additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheets  and we will not recognize subsequent changes in their fair value 
during fiscal  we repurchased on the open market million of our convertible senior notes due in at an average price of of the principal amount of the notes repurchased

at the time of securitization of finance receivables  we are required to pledge assets equal to a specified percentage of the securitization pool to provide credit enhancement required for specific credit ratings for the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
generally  we employ two types of securitization structures 
the structure we had utilized most frequently involves the purchase of a financial guaranty insurance policy issued by an insurer 
because the financial 
table of contents guaranty insurers historically used by us have either been downgraded by the rating agencies due to risk exposures on insurance policies that guarantee mortgage debt or have decided to no longer issue insurance policies on asset backed securities  we do not anticipate utilizing this structure in the foreseeable future 
the second type of securitization structure we use and the structure we anticipate utilizing for the foreseeable future  involves the sale of subordinated asset backed securities in order to provide credit enhancement for the senior asset backed securities 
in july  we entered into a senior subordinated securitization  amcar  that has initial cash deposit and overcollateralization requirements of 
this level of credit enhancement requires significantly greater use of our capital than in similar securitization transactions we have completed in the past 
increases or decreases to the credit enhancement level required in future securitization transactions will depend  in part  on the net interest margin of the finance receivables transferred  the collateral characteristics of the finance receivables transferred  credit performance trends of our finance receivables  our financial condition and the economic environment 
in april  we entered into a one year  billion forward purchase commitment agreement with deutsche 
under this agreement and subject to certain terms  deutsche committed to purchase triple a rated asset backed securities issued by our sub prime amcar securitization platform in registered public offerings 
we paid million of upfront commitment fees and issued a warrant to purchase up to million shares of our common stock valued at million in connection with the agreement 
we utilized million of the commitment in conjunction with the execution of our amcar and transactions 
unamortized warrant costs of million and unamortized commitment fees of million  as of june   are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
effective december   we executed a letter agreement with deutsche whereby the parties mutually agreed to terminate the forward purchase commitment agreement 
the remaining unamortized warrant costs of million and unamortized commitment fees of million at the termination date were charged to interest expense during fiscal in september  we entered into agreements with wachovia capital markets  llc and wachovia bank  national association together  wachovia  to establish two funding facilities under which wachovia would provide total funding of million  during the one year term of the facilities  secured by asset backed securities as collateral 
in conjunction with our amcar transaction  we obtained funding under these facilities of million by pledging double a rated asset backed securities the class b notes as collateral and million by pledging single a rated asset backed securities the class c notes as collateral 
under these funding facilities  we retained the class b notes and the class c notes issued in the transaction and then sold the retained notes to a special purpose subsidiary  which in turn pledged such retained notes as collateral to secure the funding under the two facilities 
currently  the facilities are fully utilized 
at the end of the one year term  the facilities  if not renewed  will amortize in accordance with the securitization transaction until paid off 
we paid million of upfront commitment fees and issued a warrant to purchase up to million shares of our common stock valued at million in connection with these facilities  which are being amortized to interest expense over the one year term of the facilities 
unamortized warrant costs of million and unamortized commitment fees of million  as of june   are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
in november  we entered into a purchase agreement with fairholme under which fairholme purchased million of asset backed securities  consisting of million of class b notes and million of class c notes in the amcar transaction 
we have analyzed the warrant transactions described above under emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company s own stock asc  and determined they meet the criteria for classification as equity transactions 
as a result  the amortization of the warrant costs is reflected in additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheets  and we will not recognize subsequent changes in their fair value 

table of contents cash flows related to securitization transactions were as follows in millions years ended june  initial credit enhancement deposits restricted cash overcollateralization distributions from trusts secured financing trusts gain on sale trusts the agreements with the insurers of our securitization transactions covered by a financial guaranty insurance policy provide that if portfolio performance ratios delinquency  cumulative default or cumulative net loss in a trust s pool of receivables exceed certain targets  the specified credit enhancement levels would be increased 
the securitization transactions insured by some of our financial guaranty insurance providers are cross collateralized to a limited extent 
in the event of a shortfall in the original targeted credit enhancement requirement for any of these securitization trusts after a certain period of time  excess cash flows from other transactions insured by the same insurance provider would be used to satisfy the shortfall amount 
during fiscal and  three securitizations lb a  lb b and lb a had delinquency ratios in excess of the targeted levels 
two of these lbac securitizations lb b and lb a also had cumulative net loss and cumulative default ratios in excess of the targeted levels 
as part of an arrangement with the insurer of these transactions  the excess cash flows from our other securitizations insured by this insurer were used to fund higher credit enhancement requirements in the lbac trusts which exceeded the portfolio performance ratios 
the higher required credit enhancement levels in these three lbac trusts were reached as of june  two other lbac securitizations lb a and lb b had delinquency ratios in excess of their targeted levels as of june  excess cash flows from these trusts are being used to build higher credit enhancement in each respective trust instead of being distributed to us 
during fiscal  we entered into an agreement with an insurer to increase the portfolio performance ratios in the m securitization 
in return for higher portfolio performance ratios  we agreed to use excess cash flow from other securitizations insured by this insurer to fund the higher credit enhancement requirement for the m trust 
as of june   we had reached the higher required credit enhancement in this trust 
during fiscal  we amended certain other portfolio performance ratios in this securitization and in return we agreed to increase the restricted cash account in this securitization by approximately million 
the agreements that we have entered into with our financial guaranty insurance providers in connection with securitization transactions insured by them contain additional specified targeted portfolio performance ratios delinquency  cumulative default and cumulative net loss that are higher than the limits referred to above 
if  at any measurement date  the targeted portfolio performance ratios with respect to any insured trust were to exceed these additional levels  provisions of the agreements permit the financial guaranty insurance providers to declare the occurrence of an event of default and take steps to terminate our servicing rights to the receivables sold to that trust 
in addition  the servicing agreements on certain insured securitization trusts are cross defaulted so that a default declared under one servicing agreement would allow the financial guaranty insurance provider to terminate our servicing rights under all servicing agreements for securitization trusts in which they issued a financial guaranty insurance policy 
additionally  if these higher targeted portfolio performance levels were exceeded and the financial guaranty insurance providers elect to declare an event of default  the insurance providers may retain all excess cash generated by other securitization transactions insured by them as additional credit enhancement 
this  in turn  could result in defaults under our other securitizations and other material indebtedness  including under our senior note and convertible note indentures 
although we have never exceeded these additional targeted portfolio performance ratios  and we currently believe it is unlikely that an event of 
table of contents default would be declared and our servicing rights terminated if we were to exceed these higher targeted ratios  there can be no assurance that an event of default will not be declared and our servicing rights will not be terminated if i such targeted portfolio performance ratios are breached  ii we breach our obligations under the servicing agreements  iii the financial guaranty insurance providers are required to make payments under a policy  or iv certain bankruptcy or insolvency events were to occur 
as of june   no such servicing right termination events have occurred with respect to any of the trusts formed by us 
stock repurchases during fiscal and  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share  and  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share  respectively 
we did not repurchase any shares of common stock in fiscal we have repurchased  million of our common stock since inception of our share repurchase program in april  and we have remaining authorization to repurchase million of our common stock 
covenants in our indentures entered into with respect to our senior notes and convertible senior notes limit our ability to repurchase stock 
currently  we are not eligible to repurchase shares under the indenture limits and do not anticipate pursuing repurchase activity for the foreseeable future 
recent market developments we anticipate a number of factors will continue to adversely impact our liquidity in fiscal i higher credit enhancement levels in our credit facilities and in any securitization transactions we may execute  ii unprecedented disruptions in the capital markets making the availability of credit facilities and execution of securitization transactions more challenging and expensive  and iii decreasing cash distributions from our securitization trusts due to weaker credit performance 
throughout calendar and the first half of calendar  we continually revised our operating plans in an effort to preserve and strengthen our capital and liquidity position and to maintain sufficient capacity on our credit facilities to fund new loan originations until capital market conditions improve for securitization transactions 
under these revised plans  we increased the minimum credit score requirements and tightened loan structures for new loan originations  decreased our originations infrastructure by closing and consolidating credit center locations  selectively decreased the number of dealers from whom we purchase loans and reduced originations and support function headcount 
we have discontinued new originations in our direct lending  leasing and specialty prime platforms  certain partner relationships  and in canada 
our origination levels were reduced to million for the three months ended june   compared to million for the three months ended june  we completed a securitization transaction in july and used the proceeds primarily to repay borrowings under our credit facilities 
as a result  we have greater unused borrowing capacity on our credit facilities and we are seeking to modestly increase origination levels in fiscal from our annualized originations levels for the three months ended june  we believe we have sufficient liquidity and warehouse capacity to operate through fiscal with the amendment of our master warehouse facility  execution of our amcar securitization and our current targeted level of new loan originations we do not anticipate having to access the securitization market again until the second half of fiscal however  if we are unable to renew our master warehouse facility at a sufficient size at maturity in march or if the asset backed securities market is not accessible on reasonable terms in the second half of fiscal  we may need to curtail or even suspend origination activities to sustain adequate liquidity 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fluctuations in market interest rates impact our credit facilities and securitization transactions 
our gross interest rate spread  which is the difference between interest earned on our finance receivables and interest paid  is affected by changes in interest rates as a result of our dependence upon the issuance of variable rate securities and the incurrence of variable rate debt to fund our purchases of finance receivables 
credit facilities finance receivables purchased by us and pledged to secure borrowings under our credit facilities bear fixed interest rates 
amounts borrowed under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates 
to protect the interest rate spread within each credit facility  our special purpose finance subsidiaries are contractually required to purchase interest rate cap agreements in connection with borrowings under our credit facilities 
the purchaser of the interest rate cap agreement pays a premium in return for the right to receive the difference in the interest cost at any time a specified index of market interest rates rises above the stipulated cap rate 
the purchaser of the interest rate cap agreement bears no obligation or liability if interest rates fall below the cap rate 
as part of our interest rate risk management strategy and when economically feasible  we may simultaneously sell a corresponding interest rate cap agreement in order to offset the premium paid by our special purpose finance subsidiary to purchase the interest rate cap agreement and thus retain the interest rate risk 
the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement purchased by the special purpose finance subsidiary is included in other assets and the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement sold by us is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
in november  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in interest payments on our medium term note facility caused by fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate 
these interest rate swap agreements are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are included in liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
securitizations the interest rate demanded by investors in our securitization transactions depends on prevailing market interest rates for comparable transactions and the general interest rate environment 
we utilize several strategies to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our gross interest rate margin  including the use of derivative financial instruments and the regular sale or pledging of auto receivables to securitization trusts 
in our securitization transactions  we transfer fixed rate finance receivables to trusts that  in turn  sell either fixed rate or floating rate securities to investors 
the fixed rates on securities issued by the trusts are indexed to market interest rate swap spreads for transactions of similar duration or various london interbank offered rates libor and do not fluctuate during the term of the securitization 
the floating rates on securities issued by the trusts are indexed to libor and fluctuate periodically based on movements in libor 
derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swap and cap agreements  are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on these transactions 
we use interest rate swap agreements to convert the variable rate exposures on securities issued by our securitization trusts to a fixed rate  thereby locking in the gross interest rate spread to be earned by us over the life of a securitization 
interest rate swap agreements purchased by us do not impact the amount of cash flows to be received by holders of the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
the interest rate swap agreements serve to offset the impact of increased or decreased interest paid by the trusts on floating rate asset backed securities on the cash flows to be received by us from the trusts 
we utilize such arrangements to modify our net interest sensitivity to levels deemed appropriate based on our risk tolerance 
in circumstances where the interest rate risk is deemed to be tolerable  usually if the risk is less than one year in term at inception  we may choose not to hedge potential fluctuations in cash flows due to changes in interest rates 
our special purpose finance subsidiaries are contractually required to purchase a derivative financial instrument to protect the net spread in connection with the issuance of floating rate securities even if we choose not to hedge our future cash flows 
although the interest rate cap agreements are purchased by the trusts  cash outflows from the trusts 
table of contents ultimately impact our retained interests in the securitization transactions as cash expended by the securitization trusts will decrease the ultimate amount of cash to be received by us 
therefore  when economically feasible  we may simultaneously sell a corresponding interest rate cap agreement to offset the premium paid by the trust to purchase the interest rate cap agreement 
the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements purchased by the special purpose finance subsidiaries in connection with securitization transactions are included in other assets and the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements sold by us are included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements are reflected in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive operations 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in interest payments on nine of our active securitization transactions 
portions of these interest rate swap agreements are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as hedges is included in liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
interest rate swap agreements that are not designated as hedges are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets

notional amounts on interest rate swap and cap agreements are based on contractual terms 
credit facilities and securitization notes payable amounts have been classified based on expected payoff 
senior notes and convertible senior notes principal amounts have been classified based on maturity 
the notional amounts of interest rate swap and cap agreements  which are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts  represent average amounts that will be outstanding for each of the years included in the table 
notional amounts do not represent amounts exchanged by parties and  thus  are not a measure of our exposure to loss through our use of these agreements 
management monitors our hedging activities to ensure that the value of derivative financial instruments  their correlation to the contracts being hedged and the amounts being hedged continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk 
however  there can be no assurance that our strategies will be effective in minimizing interest rate risk or that increases in interest rates will not have an adverse effect on our profitability
