item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook summary we reported solid financial results from operations for the fourth quarter and the year ended as we anticipated in the third quarter  the effect of the global economic downturn and substantial drop in oil and natural gas prices has primarily been limited to our us gulf of mexico gom barge business 
utilization of our international rigs was solid during the fourth quarter  and our rental tool business continued to perform at high utilization rates 
the worldwide economy has continued to slow and the global recession continues to widen 
we believe that our strategy  performance and diversification have been sound  and have cushioned us from the severity of current market forces  but the nature and extent of any reduction in worldwide demand for drilling as a consequence of a worldwide economic recession and its ultimate effect on our operations is still unknown 
we believe that utilization of our international rigs will remain stable in due to the number of rigs under long term contracts see item a risk factors  and expect our rental tools business to remain stable as well 
accordingly  we expect our operating performance in these two segments to be better than what current industry trends would indicate 
we expect utilization of our gom barge rigs to remain at low levels for the near future as customers in this market are watching energy prices and waiting for signs of stability before making decisions on spending plans for however  operators may curtail or delay projects that are dependent upon financing or may experience an inability to pay suppliers and or service companies  including our company 
we have not experienced material delays in payments from our customers 
overview in the fourth quarter of we took a million non cash goodwill charge primarily as a result of the application of sfas no 
in today s economic environment 
current accounting rules require a comparison of carrying values of assets including goodwill to current equity is in excess of market capitalization 
the write off eliminates all of the goodwill that was recognized at the time we acquired our rental tools business and gom barge rigs in this goodwill write off will have no impact on ongoing operations or cash flows 
exclusive of the goodwill charge  we achieved record operating results for the entire year 
in the fourth quarter of gross margin declined million to million as compared to million for the third quarter of our gom barge business gross margin was million for the fourth quarter of  lower than the gross margin achieved in the third quarter of for the year  gom results  while lower than previous periods  were solid at million operating gross margin 
gross margin for our international drilling operations declined in the fourth quarter of as compared to the third quarter of overall by million due to million related to equipment changes that delayed drilling on our four rig contract in western kazakhstan 
gross margins in our other international operations increased by million in the fourth quarter of as compared to the third quarter of  with increases coming from all regions and all areas other than the karachaganak area in western kazakhstan discussed above 
overall  utilization for our international fleet was percent for the fourth quarter of as compared to percent in the third quarter of rental tools gross margin increased percent in the fourth quarter of  as compared to the third quarter of as a result of increased rental tools sales 
our rental tools segment achieved another year of record operating results 
gross margin from our contract and engineering services business increased million in the fourth quarter of as compared to the third quarter of  primarily as a result of higher dayrates on our operations and maintenance contracts  and earnings on our rig construction project 
capital expenditures for totaled million  including major projects of million and for maintenance and drill pipe 
major projects included completion of new rigs of approximately million  construction on aadu rigs and office set up for alaska operations of million  
table of contents overview and outlook continued overview continued million upgrades and refurbishments for gom barges and million for equipment and property for our rental tools business 
cash expenditures totaled million  with an additional million in accrued expenditures 
outlook we expect solid earnings from our international operations throughout we expect increases in earnings for our four rig contract in kazakhstan as drilling resumed in late december for one rig  february for two and in early march for the last rig 
two of these rigs are under contract through mid and the other two through mid in mexico we have eight rigs drilling  two of which are under contract through mid  four of which are under contract through early to mid  one through the third quarter of  and one with a recent three well extension which is expected to keep the rig operating throughout current utilization of our international rigs is at percent 
our rental tools operations should remain stable as we anticipate many of our major oil company customers will continue to operate at current levels  primarily in deepwater e p projects 
in fact  several of our largest customers have indicated that their drilling programs will continue at prior year levels 
in addition  we expect the development of unconventional resource plays to continue through as operators ensure that they satisfy their drilling obligations under oil and gas leases in these areas  particularly in the haynesville shale area  which are generally short term and expensive 
we also expect solid results from our project management and engineering services segment  including increased earnings from our construction contract segment in these increased earnings are due primarily to the bp liberty construction contract as we progress toward the completion of the construction and delivery of the rig which is targeted for the first quarter earnings on this project are based on percentage of completion 
current us gom barge utilization is with only three rigs drilling 
barge will resume operation in early march after the completion of shipyard refurbishments 
we are in discussion with other customers regarding drilling prospects which could be awarded as early as march however  we currently have no assurance that gom utilization will increase as this is dependent upon the factors noted above 
see also risk factors in item a 
capital expenditures for are projected to be approximately million which includes approximately million for major projects and million for maintenance and drill pipe spending of which million is for quail 
major projects are comprised primarily of million to complete the alaskan aadu alaskan arctic drilling units rigs and facilities and approximately million for upgrades for our barge rig operating in the caspian sea 
on september  we drew down million on our revolving credit facility  and on october and   we drew down an additional aggregate amount of million 
the funds will be used over the next months to fund the construction of two new build rigs to perform the five year drilling contract in alaska based on the executed letter of intent with bp 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  we recorded net income of million for the year ended december  which included a goodwill write off of million  as compared to net income of million for the year ended december  operating gross margin was million for the year ended december  which consists of increases in international drilling operations  project management and engineering services  construction contract and rental tools of million offset by a decrease of million in us drilling and a million increase in depreciation expense as compared to the year ended december  in  we began separate presentation of our project management and engineering services segment 

we have begun to separately monitor this non capital intensive segment as a focus of our long term strategic growth plan 
prior to  these results were included in the us and international drilling segments  and as 
table of contents overview and outlook continued overview continued such  segment information has been recasted to conform to the new presentation 
we also created a new segment in to separately reflect results of our extended reach rig construction contract

the gross margin amounts  excluding depreciation and amortization  and gross margin percentages should not be used as a substitute for those amounts reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
however  we monitor our business segments based on several criteria  including gross margin 
management believes that this information is useful to our investors because it more accurately reflects cash generated by segment 
such gross margin amounts are reconciled to our most comparable gaap measure as follows 
table of contents results of operations continued project management international and construction us drilling drilling engineering contract rental tools year ended december  dollars in thousands operating gross margin depreciation and amortization operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization year ended december  operating gross margin depreciation and amortization operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization operating gross margin revenues less direct operating expenses  including depreciation and amortization expense 
us drilling segment revenues for the u 
s drilling segment decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decreased revenues were primarily due to a million decrease for our barge drilling operations as average dayrates for our deep drilling barges fell approximately  per day 
also in we had two land rigs drilling in the us that historically operate in our international land segment 
these rigs contributed million in revenues as compared to no us revenues in the same period for as the two rigs were relocated to our mexico operations during as a result of the above mentioned factors  gross margins  excluding depreciation and amortization  decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of international drilling segment international drilling revenues increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in revenues in mexico  algeria and turkmenistan increased by million  million and million  respectively  as there were minimal drilling operations in these countries during and a dayrate increase for our barge rig operating in mexico 
revenues in the cis region increased by million primarily attributable to a million increase in the karachaganak area of kazakhstan as a result of the addition of rigs and to existing operations of rigs and  an increase in the dayrate for our barge rig operating in the caspian sea and the above mentioned turkmenistan revenues 
these increases were offset by lower utilization of our two rigs in colombia in  resulting in a decrease of million as compared to in our asia pacific region  revenues decreased million due mainly to completion of our contract within bangladesh for rig in march million  lower utilization in papua new guinea million being partially offset by a million increase in new zealand due to increased dayrates and operating days and a million increase in our indonesia operations 
international operating gross margin  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased million to million during the year ended compared to the year ended  due primarily to favorable increases in our operations in mexico million and the cis region million  offset by decreases in colombia million and our asia pacific region million 
the increase in mexico is attributable to five rigs operating the entire period in and two rigs commencing operations in february in as we were in the start up phase for these operations in the third quarter of in the cis region  the primary driver was the increased dayrates for our barge rig operating in the caspian sea  increased utilization in the 
table of contents results of operations continued international drilling segment continued karachaganak area of kazakhstan and operation of rig in turkmenistan were the main drivers of the million increase 
in colombia  the completion of our contracts in late and late february were the cause of the decrease  although rig began a one year contract in mid may our asia pacific region decline of million was a result of rig in bangladesh not operating in as compared to and papua new guinea incurring lower utilization when compared to the same period of  with these declines being partially offset by increases in our new zealand and indonesia operations 
project management and engineering services segment revenues for this segment increased million during as compared to this increase was the result of higher revenues for our operations in sakhalin island million and kuwait million 
for sakhalin operations  million was due to higher dayrates and million due to reimbursable expenses on which we earn a fixed fee 
for our kuwait contract million of the increase was due to reimbursables and million was due to additional services provided 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in our papua new guinea project management contracts that ceased operations during project management and engineering services do not incur depreciation and amortization  and as such  gross margin for this segment increased million in the current period as compared to the prior period 
labor rate increases effective in november which were retroactive to june  positively impacted gross margin 
construction contract segment revenues from the construction of the extended reach drilling rig for use in the alaskan beaufort sea were million for this project is a cost plus fixed fee contract 
gross margin for the epci project was million based on the percentage of completion of the contract in which costs to date compared to projected total costs are used to determine the percent complete cost to cost method 
rental tools segment rental tools revenues increased million to million during the year ended december  as compared to the increase was due primarily to an increase in rental revenues of million at our texarkana  texas facility  million at our new iberia  louisiana facility  million from our newest location in williston  north dakota and million from our victoria  texas location  partially offset by declines of million from our evanston  wyoming facility  million at our odessa  texas location and million at our international operations 
revenues increased as a result of our expansion efforts in texarkana  texas and williston  north dakota 
rental tools gross margins  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased million to million for the current period as compared to the and expansion of quail has been completed as equipment has been delivered and quail s new facility in texarkana  texas opened in april the new facility provides increased coverage of the barnett  fayetteville  woodford and haynesville shale areas in east texas  southwest arkansas  southeast oklahoma and northwest louisiana 
other financial data gain on asset dispositions was million  a decrease of million as a result of minor asset sales in as compared to gains of million during the same period in as we sold two workover barge rigs in january for a recognized gain of million 
interest expense for was relatively unchanged as compared to the same period of interest income for decreased million due to lower cash balances available for investments as compared to general and administration expense increased million as compared to the year ended  due primarily to higher legal and professional fees associated with the ongoing doj and sec investigations into the customs agent discussed in note in 
table of contents results of operations continued other financial data continued the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these fees included upgrades to our compliance process and code of conduct 
in  we entered into two variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements 
the swap agreements did not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly  we reported the mark to market change in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives in earnings 
during  we had no swaps outstanding and therefore reported no charge or benefit related to swaps  as compared to the year ended december  where we recognized a million decrease in the fair value of the derivative positions 
for additional information see note income tax expense was million for the year ended december   as compared to income tax expense of million for the year ended december  income tax expense for includes a benefit of million of fin interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our settlement of interest related to our kazakhstan tax case see note kazakhstan tax case  the establishment of a valuation allowance of million related to a papua new guinea deferred tax asset  the reversal of a million valuation allowance relating to foreign tax credits  a charge of million accounted for under fin related to certain intercompany transactions between our us companies and foreign affiliates  a charge of million related to non deductible goodwill and a benefit of million for the recovering of prior years foreign taxes as a credit in the us versus a deduction 
based on the level of projected future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax asset is deductible in papua new guinea  management believes that it is more likely than not that our subsidiary will not realize the benefit of this deduction in papua new guinea 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  we recorded net income of million for the year ended december   as compared to net income of million for the year ended december  operating gross margin was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  gain on disposition of assets for was million as compared to million in the comparable period in

us drilling segment revenues for the u 
s drilling segment increased million to million for as compared to the increased revenues were primarily due to a million increase for deep drilling barges  as a result of a full year of operations for ultra deep barge rig  percent fleet utilization in versus percent in and a percent increase in dayrates 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in revenues for intermediate and workover barges due primarily to the sale of workover barge rigs and see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
barge rig was undergoing an upgrade from workover to deep drilling status until late may and newly constructed barge rig began operations in december during we also had two repositioned international land rigs operating in the us market which contributed million to the increase in us drilling segment revenues 
average dayrates for the deep drilling barge rigs increased approximately  per day in as compared to as a result of higher dayrates and additional revenue days on the deep drilling barge rigs  the addition of two land rigs  gross margins  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased million to million 
this increase includes a million decrease for the two land rigs as a result of expenses incurred in moving the rigs out of the us after completion of wells in early international drilling segment international drilling revenues increased million to million during the year ended december  of this increase  million is related to an increase in international land drilling revenues  offset by a million decrease in revenues from offshore operations due primarily to the sale of our barge rigs in nigeria in the third quarter of in our americas region  drilling revenues in mexico increased million to million due to higher dayrates under the new contracts entered into in and higher utilization

our equity loss related to our percent owned joint venture in saudi arabia was million  consisting of million in accrued liquidated damages  a operating loss and a million reserve for advances to the joint venture 
general and administration expense decreased million as compared to the year ended as a result of a change  in going forward in our method of estimating the amount of corporate shared services costs allocable to operations 
the current method is based on a third party study of actual shared service time spent on each operation  whereas the previous method was less precise and based on each operation s portion of total revenues

the obligations of the company under the credit facility are guaranteed by substantially all of the company s domestic subsidiaries  except for domestic subsidiaries owned by foreign subsidiaries and certain immaterial subsidiaries  each of which has executed a guaranty 
the credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants regarding ratios for consolidated leverage  consolidated interest coverage and consolidated senior secured leverage 
as of december  our consolidated leverage ratio was to compared to the maximum permitted to  our consolidated interest coverage ratio was to compared to the minimum permitted to and our consolidated senior secured leverage ratio was to compared to the maximum permitted to at this time the company does not anticipate triggering any of these covenants during the credit facility is available for general corporate purposes and to fund reimbursement obligations under letters of credit the banks issue on our behalf pursuant to this facility 
revolving loans are available under the credit facility subject to a borrowing base calculation based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable  certain specified barge drilling rigs and eligible rental equipment of the company and its subsidiary guarantors 
as of december   there were million in letters of credit outstanding  million outstanding on the term loan facility and million outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
the term loan will begin amortizing on september  at equal installments of million per quarter 
as of december   the amount drawn represents percent of the capacity of the revolving credit facility which also reflects a million reduction in available borrowing resulting from the bankruptcy filing of lehman brothers holdings  inc  the parent corporation of lehman commercial paper  inc  which had a million lending commitment 
subsequent to year end  lehman commercial paper  inc assigned its obligations under the credit facility to trustmark national bank 
on the closing date  january   trustmark national bank fully funded lehman commercial paper  inc s commitments  including an additional million that lehman commercial paper  inc did not fund in october  therefore  increasing our borrowings under the revolving credit facility to million 
the company expects to use the drawn amounts over the next twelve months to fund construction of two new rigs for work in alaska 
although the credit crisis may affect certain customers ability to pay  the company anticipates it has sufficient liquidity to meet its expected capital expenditures and manage any delays in collection of receivables 
percent convertible senior notes on july   we issued million aggregate principal amount of percent convertible senior notes the notes due july  the notes were issued at par and interest is payable semiannually on july th and january th 
the significant terms of the convertible notes are as follows notes conversion feature the initial conversion price for note holders to convert their notes into shares is at a common stock share price equivalent of shares of common stock per  note value 
conversion rate adjustments occur for any issuances of stock  warrants  rights or options except for stock purchase plans or dividend re investments or any other transfer of benefit to substantially all stockholders  or as a result of a tender or exchange offer 
the company may  under advice of its board of directors  increase the conversion rate at its sole discretion for a period of at least days 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources continued financing activities continued notes settlement feature upon tender of the notes for conversion  the company can either settle entirely in shares or a combination of cash and shares  solely at the company s option 
the company s policy is to satisfy our conversion obligation for our notes in cash  rather than in common stock  for at least the aggregate principal amount of the notes 
this reduced the resulting potential earnings dilution to only include any possible conversion premium  which would be the difference between the average price of our shares and the conversion price per share of common stock 
contingent conversion feature note holders may only convert notes into shares when either sales price or trading price conditions are met  on or after the notes due date or upon certain accounting changes or certain corporate transactions fundamental changes involving stock distributions 
make whole provisions are only included in the accounting and fundamental change conversions such that holders do not lose value as a result of the changes 
over allotment provision the initial offering was for million aggregate principal amount with an over allotment provision to allow the underwriters an option to purchase an additional million 
the option was in fact  exercised for the entire million on the same date on which the notes were issued  and therefore was never outstanding 
settlement feature upon conversion  we will pay shares of our common stock and cash  if any  based on a daily conversion rate multiplied by a volume weighted average price of our common stock during a specified period following the conversion date 
conversions can be settled in cash or shares  solely at our discretion 
as of december   none of the conditions allowing holders of the senior notes to convert had been met 
concurrently with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  the company purchased a convertible note hedge the note hedge and sold warrants in private transactions with counterparties that were different than the ultimate holders of the notes 
the note hedge included purchasing free standing call options and selling free standing warrants  both exercisable in the company s common shares 
the convertible note hedge allows us to receive shares of our common stock from the counterparties to the transaction equal to the amount of common stock related to the excess conversion value that we would issue and or pay to the holders of the senior convertible notes upon conversion 
the terms of the call options mirror the notes major terms whereby the call option strike price is the same as the initial conversion price as are the number of shares callable  per share and  shares respectively 
this feature prevents dilution of the company s outstanding shares 
the warrants allow the company to sell  common shares at a strike price of per share 
the conversion price of the notes remains at per share  and the existence of the call options and warrants serve to guard against dilution at share prices less than per share  since we would be able to satisfy our obligations and deliver shares upon conversion of the notes with shares that are obtained by exercising the call options 
we paid a premium of approximately million for the call options  and we received proceeds for a premium of approximately million for the sale of the warrants 
this reduced the net cost of the note hedge to million 
the expiration date of the note hedge is the earlier of the last day on which the convertible notes remain outstanding  and the maturity date of the convertible notes 
the convertible notes are a legal form debt and are classified as a liability in our consolidated financial statements 
because we have the choice of settling the call options and the warrants in cash or shares of our common stock  and these contracts meet all of the applicable criteria for equity classification as outlined in eitf no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  the cost of the call options and proceeds from the sale of the warrants are classified in stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  because both of these contracts are 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources continued financing activities continued classified in stockholders equity and are solely indexed to our own common stock  they are not accounted for as derivatives under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
debt issuance costs totaled approximately million and are being amortized over the five year term of the notes using the effective interest method 
proceeds from the transaction of million were used to call our outstanding senior floating rate notes  to pay the net cost of hedge and warrant transactions  and for general corporate purposes 
on september   we redeemed million face value of our senior floating rate notes pursuant to a redemption notice dated august  at the redemption price of percent 
a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our convertible senior notes was used to fund the redemption 
credit facility on september   we replaced our existing million credit agreement with a new million amended and restated credit agreement credit facility which expires in september the credit facility is secured by rental tools equipment  accounts receivable and the stock of substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries  other than domestic subsidiaries owned by a foreign subsidiary and contains customary affirmative and negative covenants such as minimum ratios for consolidated leverage  consolidated interest coverage and consolidated senior secured leverage 
the credit facility was available for general corporate purposes and to fund reimbursement obligations under letters of credit the banks issue on our behalf pursuant to this facility 
revolving loans were available under the credit facility subject to a borrowing base limitation based on percent of eligible receivables plus a value for eligible rental tools equipment 
the credit facility called for a borrowing base calculation only when the credit facility had outstanding loans  including letters of credit  totaling at least million 
as of december   there were million in letters of credit outstanding and million of outstanding loans 
other liquidity on january  we completed the public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  for total net proceeds of million before expenses  but after underwriter discount 
proceeds from this offering were used for capital expansions  including rig upgrades  new rig construction and expansion of our rental tools business

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  materials and supplies obsolescence  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes  workers compensation and health insurance and contingent liabilities for which settlement is deemed to be probable 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that such estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies as they are complex and require significant judgments  assumptions and or estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
other significant accounting policies are summarized in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of property  plant and equipment 
we periodically evaluate our property  plant and equipment to ensure that the net carrying value is not in excess of the net realizable value 
we review our property  plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may be impaired 
for example  evaluations are performed when we experience sustained significant declines in utilization and dayrates and we do not contemplate recovery in the near future  or when we reclassify property and equipment to assets held for sale or as discontinued operations as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we consider a number of factors  including estimated undiscounted future cash flows  appraisals less estimated selling costs and current market value analysis in determining net realizable value 
assets are written down to fair value if the fair value is below net carrying value 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
they involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets and reflect management s assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels  dayrates and costs 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets 
as a result of certain impairment indicators mentioned in impairment of goodwill below  we tested our long lived assets for impairment as of december  and determined there was no asset impairment required 
impairment of goodwill 
we periodically assess whether the excess of cost over net assets acquired goodwill is impaired based generally on the estimated fair value of that operation 
if the estimated fair value is in excess of the carrying value of the operation  no further analysis is performed 
if the fair value of each operation to which goodwill has been assigned is less than its carrying value  we deduct the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and compare the residual amount to the carrying value of the goodwill to determine if impairment should be recorded 
changes in dayrate and utilization assumptions used in the fair value calculations could result in fair value estimates that are below carrying value  resulting in an impairment of goodwill 
we also test for impairment based on other events or changes in circumstances that may indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform an annual impairment analysis of goodwill at each year end 
our annual impairment tests of goodwill for and indicated 
table of contents other matters continued critical accounting policies continued that the fair value of operations to which goodwill relates exceeded the carrying values as of december  and  accordingly  no impairments were recorded 
in  we wrote off all goodwill as the carrying value of the reporting units to which goodwill related  was in excess of fair value as calculated under sfas no 
the write off was driven primarily by adverse market conditions that reduced the company s equity market capitalization below its shareholders equity see note  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
insurance reserves 
our operations are subject to many hazards inherent to the drilling industry  including blowouts  explosions  fires  loss of well control  loss of hole  damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters 
any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death  damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities  suspension of operations  environmental damage and damage to the property of others 
generally  drilling contracts provide for the division of responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer  and we seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks 
to the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements  we seek protection through insurance 
however  there is no assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above 
moreover  our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible 
based on the risks discussed above  we estimate our liability in excess of insurance coverage and record reserves for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
reserves related to insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the insurance claims and our past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of insured claims could differ significantly from the amounts estimated 
we accrue actuarially determined amounts in our consolidated balance sheet to cover self insurance retentions for workers compensation  employers liability  general liability  automobile liability claims and health benefits 
these accruals use historical data based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims to project future losses 
these estimates and accruals have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount of claims paid 
as the determination of our liability for insurance claims could be material and is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts  management believes that accounting estimates related to insurance reserves are critical 
accounting for income taxes 
we are a us company and we operate through our various foreign branches and subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world 
consequently  our tax provision is based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income is earned 
the income tax rates imposed and methods of computing taxable income in these jurisdictions vary 
therefore  as a part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
our effective tax rate for financial statement purposes will continue to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions 
current income tax expense represents either liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year  nonresident withholding taxes or changes in prior year tax estimates which may result from tax audit adjustments 
our deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported on the consolidated balance sheet 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in order to determine the amount of deferred tax assets or liabilities  as well as the valuation allowances  we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income  where rigs will be deployed and other matters 
changes in these estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the deferred tax assets and liabilities or valuation allowances  including as discussed below 

table of contents other matters continued critical accounting policies continued our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets requires that we achieve certain future earnings levels prior to the expiration of our nol net operating loss carryforwards 
in the event that our earnings performance projections do not indicate that we will be able to benefit from our nol carryforwards  valuation allowances are established 
we periodically evaluate our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards and  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  will record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
we provide for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as the earnings are not permanently reinvested 
our accounting policy for income taxes is also affected by fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which we adopted january  this interpretation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts recorded as liabilities and related disclosures due to the uncertainty as to final resolution of certain tax matters 
because the recognition of liabilities under this interpretation may require periodic adjustments and may not necessarily imply any change in management s assessment of the ultimate outcome of these items  the amount recorded may not accurately anticipate actual outcome 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues and expenses on dayrate contracts as drilling progresses 
for meterage contracts  which are rare  we recognize the revenues and expenses upon completion of the well 
revenues from rental activities are recognized ratably over the rental term which is generally less than six months 
mobilization fees received and related mobilization costs incurred are deferred and amortized over the term of the contract period 
construction contract revenues and costs are recognized on a percentage of completion basis using the cost to cost method 
recent accounting pronouncements see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in  we entered into two variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements 
the swap agreements did not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly  we reported the mark to market change in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives in earnings 
for the year ended december   we recognized a million decrease in the fair value of the derivative positions and for the year ended december  we recognized a minimal change in the fair value of the derivative positions 
on july   we terminated one swap scheduled to expire in september and received million 
the second swap was not renewed and expired on september  long term debt the estimated fair value of our million principal amount of senior notes due  based on quoted market prices  was million at december  the estimated fair value of our million principal amount of convertible senior notes due was million on december
