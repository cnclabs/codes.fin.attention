item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if  as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions  we are unable to receive sufficient dividends and or distributions from our businesses  we may be limited in our ability to reduce the level of our outstanding debt and declare distributions on our llc interests 

table of contents we may not be able to successfully fund future acquisitions due to the unavailability of debt or equity financing on acceptable terms  which could impede the implementation of our acquisition strategy and negatively impact our business 
one component of our strategy over the long term is the pursuit of growth through selective acquisitions 
in order to make acquisitions  we will generally require funding from external sources 
since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be readily predicted  we may need to be able to obtain funding on short notice to benefit fully from attractive opportunities 
sufficient funding for an acquisition may not be available on short notice or may not be available on terms acceptable to us  particularly in light of the ongoing difficulties in the credit and capital markets 
furthermore  the level of our subsidiary indebtedness may limit our ability to obtain additional financing at the corporate holding company level 
in addition to debt financing  our strategy over the long term is to fund or refinance a portion of the consideration for future acquisitions through the issuance of additional llc interests 
if our llc interests do not have a sufficient per share market value  issuance of new llc interests may not be economically attractive or  if issued regardless  may result in significant dilution of our then existing shareholders 
in addition  issuances of new llc interests  either privately or publicly  may occur at a discount to the price of our llc interests on the nyse at the time 
our equity financing activities may cause the market price of our stock to decline 
alternatively  we may not be able to complete the issuance of the required amount of llc interests on short notice or at all due to a lack of investor demand for the llc interests at prices that we find acceptable 
an inability to fund acquisitions on acceptable terms or at all would prevent us from pursuing our acquisition strategy 
our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy and to pay and grow distributions over the long term depends on our ability to successfully implement our acquisition strategy and manage the growth of our business 
a major component of our strategy over the long term is to acquire additional infrastructure businesses both within the sectors in which we currently operate and in sectors where we currently have no presence 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses in a timely manner  failure of the acquired business to implement strategic initiatives we set for it  achieve expected synergies and or achieve expected results  failure to identify material risks or liabilities associated with the acquired business prior to its acquisition  diversion of management s attention and internal resources away from the management of existing businesses and operations  and the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business 
we expect to face significant competition for acquisition opportunities  and some of our competitors may have greater financial resources or access to financing on more favorable terms than we will 
this competition may limit our acquisition opportunities  lead to higher acquisition prices or both 
we cannot assure you that we will benefit from our relationship with the macquarie group to help us make or finance acquisitions 
the successful implementation of our acquisition strategy to date  particularly acquisitions in the airport services business and of a interest in imtt  has resulted in the rapid growth of our business and places significant demands on management  administrative  operational and financial resources 
we have devoted significant resources to integrating acquired businesses of which most  if not all  would have been privately owned and not subject to financial and disclosure requirements and controls applicable to us public companies 
we have and may in the future expend significant time and resources to develop and implement effective systems and procedures  including accounting and financial reporting systems  for these acquired businesses 
furthermore  other than our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  the personnel of macquarie s capital funds division performing services for us under the management services agreement may work on matters unrelated to the company and its businesses  which may result in a further diversion of management time and resources 
our ability to manage our growth will depend on our maintaining and allocating an appropriate level of internal resources  information systems and controls throughout our business 
our inability to successfully implement our growth strategy or successfully manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our business  cash flow and ability to pay distributions on our llc interests 

table of contents we own  and may acquire in the future  investments in which we share voting control with third parties and  consequently  our ability to exercise significant influence over the business or level of their distributions to us may be limited 
we own of imtt and may acquire less than majority ownership in other businesses in the future 
our ability to influence the management of jointly controlled businesses  and the ability of these businesses to continue operating without disruption  depends on our reaching agreement with our co investors and reconciling investment and performance objectives for these businesses 
to the extent that we are unable to agree with co investors regarding the business and operations of the relevant investment  the performance of the investment and level of distributions to us are likely to suffer  and could have a material adverse effect on our results and our ability to raise capital or pay distributions on our llc interests 
furthermore  we may from time to time own non controlling interests in investments 
management and controlling shareholders of these investments may develop different objectives than we have and may not make distributions to us at levels that we had anticipated 
our inability to exercise significant influence over the operations  strategies and policies of non controlled investments means that decisions could be made that could adversely affect our results and our ability to generate cash and pay distributions on our llc interests 
our business is dependent on our relationships  on a contractual and regulatory level  with government entities that may have significant leverage over us 
government entities may be influenced by political considerations to take actions adverse to us 
our business generally is  and will continue to be  subject to substantial regulation by governmental agencies 
in addition  our business relies on obtaining and maintaining government permits  licenses  concessions  leases or contracts 
government entities  due to the wide ranging scope of their authority  have significant leverage over us in their contractual and regulatory relationships with us that they may exercise in a manner that causes us delays in the operation of our business or pursuit of our strategy  or increased administrative expense 
furthermore  government permits  licenses  concessions  leases and contracts are generally very complex  which may result in periods of non compliance  or disputes over interpretation or enforceability 
if we fail to comply with these regulations or contractual obligations  we could be subject to monetary penalties or we may lose our rights to operate the affected business  or both 
where our ability to operate an infrastructure business is subject to a concession or lease from the government  the concession or lease may restrict our ability to operate the business in a way that maximizes cash flows and profitability 
further  our ability to grow our current and future businesses will often require consent of numerous government regulators 
increased regulation restricting the ownership or management of us assets  particularly infrastructure assets  by non us persons  given the non us ultimate ownership of our manager  may limit our ability to pursue acquisitions 
any such regulation may also limit our manager s ability to continue to manage our operations  which could cause disruption to our business and a decline in our performance 
in addition  any required government consents may be costly to seek and we may not be able to obtain them 
failure to obtain any required consents could limit our ability to achieve our growth strategy 
our contracts with government entities may also contain clauses more favorable to the government counterparty than a typical commercial contract 
for instance  a lease  concession or general service contract may enable the government to terminate the agreement without requiring them to pay adequate compensation 
in addition  government counterparties also may have the discretion to change or increase regulation of our operations  or implement laws or regulations affecting our operations  separate from any contractual rights they may have 
governments have considerable discretion in implementing regulations that could impact these businesses 
because our businesses provide basic  everyday services  and face limited competition  governments may be influenced by political considerations to take actions that may hinder the efficient and profitable operation of our businesses and investments 
governmental agencies may determine the prices we charge and may be able to restrict our ability to operate our business to maximize profitability 
where our businesses or investments are sole or predominant service providers in their respective service areas and provide services that are essential to the community  they are likely to be subject to rate regulation by governmental agencies that will determine the prices they may charge 
we may also face fees or other charges imposed by government agencies that increase our costs and over which we have no control 
we may 
table of contents be subject to increases in fees or unfavorable price determinations that may be final with no right of appeal or that  despite a right of appeal  could result in our profits being negatively affected 
in addition  we may have very little negotiating leverage in establishing contracts with government entities  which may decrease the prices that we otherwise might be able to charge or the terms upon which we provide products or services 
businesses and investments we acquire in the future may also be subject to rate regulation or similar negotiating limitations 
our businesses are subject to environmental risks that may impact our future profitability 
our businesses including businesses in which we invest are subject to numerous statutes  rules and regulations relating to environmental protection 
our airport services and airport parking businesses are subject to environmental protection requirements relating to the storage  transport  pumping and transfer of fuel  and our district energy business is subject to requirements relating mainly to its handling of significant amounts of hazardous materials 
our gas production and distribution business is subject to risks and hazards associated with the refining  handling  storage and transportation of combustible products 
these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury  loss of life  damage or destruction of property and equipment  and environmental damage 
any losses we face could be greater than insurance levels maintained by our businesses  which could have an adverse effect on their and our financial results 
in addition  disruptions to physical assets could reduce our ability to serve customers and adversely affect sales and cash flows 
imtt s operations in particular are subject to complex  stringent and expensive environmental regulation and future compliance costs are difficult to estimate with certainty 
imtt also faces risks relating to the handling and transportation of significant amounts of hazardous materials 
failure to comply with regulations or other claims may give rise to interruptions in operations and civil or criminal penalties and liabilities that could adversely affect the profitability of this business and the distributions it makes to us  as could significant unexpected compliance costs 
further  these rules and regulations are subject to change and compliance with any changes could result in a restriction of the activities of our businesses  significant capital expenditures and or increased ongoing operating costs 
a number of the properties owned by imtt have been subject to environmental contamination in the past and require remediation for which imtt is liable 
these remediation obligations exist principally at imtt s bayonne and lemont facilities and could cost more than anticipated or could be incurred earlier than anticipated or both 
in addition  imtt may discover additional environmental contamination at its bayonne  lemont or other facilities that may require remediation at significant cost to imtt 
further  the past contamination of the properties owned by imtt  including by former owners or operators of such properties  could result in remediation obligations  personal injury  property damage  environmental damage or similar claims by third parties 
we may also be required to address other prior or future environmental contamination  including soil and groundwater contamination that results from the spillage of fuel  hazardous materials or other pollutants 
under various federal  state  local and foreign environmental statutes  rules and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for noncompliance with applicable environmental and health and safety requirements and for the costs of investigation  monitoring  removal or remediation of hazardous materials 
these laws often impose liability  whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of hazardous materials 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of those materials at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not that facility is or ever was owned or operated by that person and whether or not the original disposal or treatment activity accorded with all regulatory requirements 
the presence of hazardous materials on a property could result in personal injury  loss of life  damage or destruction of property and equipment  environmental damage and similar claims by third parties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating income 
we may face a greater exposure to terrorism than other companies because of the nature of our businesses and investments 
we believe that infrastructure businesses face a greater risk of terrorist attack than other businesses  particularly those businesses that have operations within the immediate vicinity of metropolitan and suburban areas 
specifically  because of the combustible nature of the products of our gas production and distribution 
table of contents business and consumer reliance on these products for basic services  the business sng plant  transmission pipelines  barges and storage facilities may be at greater risk for terrorism attacks than other businesses  which could affect its operations significantly 
any terrorist attacks that occur at or near our business locations would likely cause significant harm to our employees and assets 
as a result of the terrorist attacks in new york on september   insurers significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverage available for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism  war or similar events 
a terrorist attack that makes use of our property  or property under our control  may result in liability far in excess of available insurance coverage 
in addition  any further terrorist attack  regardless of location  could cause a disruption to our business and a decline in earnings 
furthermore  it is likely to result in an increase in insurance premiums and a reduction in coverage  which could cause our profitability to suffer 
we are dependent on certain key personnel  and the loss of key personnel  or the inability to retain or replace qualified employees  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we operate our businesses on a stand alone basis  relying on existing management teams for day to day operations 
consequently  our operational success  as well as the success of our internal growth strategy  will be dependent on the continued efforts of the management teams of our businesses  who have extensive experience in the day to day operations of these businesses 
furthermore  we will likely be dependent on the operating management teams of businesses that we may acquire in the future 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to retain or replace qualified employees  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our income may be affected adversely if additional compliance costs are required as a result of new safety  health or environmental regulation 
our businesses and investments are subject to federal  state and local safety  health and environmental laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations affect all aspects of their operations and are frequently modified 
there is a risk that any one of our businesses or investments may not be able to comply with some aspect of these laws and regulations  resulting in fines or penalties 
additionally  if new laws and regulations are adopted or if interpretations of existing laws and regulations change  we could be required to increase capital spending and incur increased operating expenses in order to comply 
because the regulatory environment frequently changes  we cannot predict when or how we may be affected by such changes 
a significant and sustained increase in the price of oil could have a negative impact on the revenue of a number of our businesses 
a significant and sustained increase in the price of oil could have a negative impact on the profitability of a number of our businesses 
higher prices for jet fuel could result in less use of aircraft by general aviation customers  which would have a negative impact on the profitability of our airport services business 
higher prices for jet fuel will increase the cost of traveling by commercial aviation  which could result in lower enplanements at the airports where our airport parking business operates and therefore less patronage of our parking facilities and lower revenue 
higher fuel prices could increase the cost of power to our businesses generally which they may not be able to fully pass on to customers 
risks related to our airport services business current economic conditions and increased pricing competition in our airport services business may have an adverse effect on our market share and fuel margins  causing a decline in the profitability of that business 
some of our competitors in our airport services business are pursuing more aggressive pricing strategies 
these competitors operate fbos at number of airports where we operate or at airports near where we operate 
this competition  combined with the continuation or worsening of current economic conditions  may result in increased focus on cost among our customers and  consequently  a decline in corporate jet usage and increased price sensitivity 
these factors may cause our volumes of fuel sales and market share to decline and may result in increased margin pressure  adversely affecting the profitability of this business 

table of contents our airport services business is subject to a variety of competitive pressures  and the actions of competitors may have a material adverse effect on the revenue of our airport services business 
fbo operators at a particular airport compete based on a number of factors  including location of the facility relative to runways and street access  service  value added features  reliability and price 
many of our fbos compete with one or more fbos at their respective airports  and  to a lesser extent  with fbos at nearby airports 
furthermore  leases related to our fbo operations may be subject to competitive bidding at the end of their term 
some present and potential competitors have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources than we do  which may negatively impact our ability to compete at each airport or for lease renewal 
our fbos do not have the right to be the sole provider of fbo services at any of our fbo locations 
the authority responsible for each airport has the ability to grant other fbo leases at the airport and new competitors could be established at those fbo locations 
the addition of new competitors is particularly likely if we are seen to be earning significant profits from these fbo operations 
any such actions  if successful  may reduce  or impair our ability to increase  the revenue of the fbo business 
the termination for cause or convenience of one or more of the fbo leases would damage our airport services business significantly 
our airport services revenue is derived from long term leases at airports and one heliport 
if we default on the terms and conditions of our leases  including upon an insolvency  the relevant authority may terminate the lease without compensation 
additionally  our leases at chicago midway  philadelphia  north east philadelphia  new orleans international and orange county airports and the metroport th street heliport in new york city  representing approximately of our airport service business gross profit in  allow the relevant authority to terminate the lease at their convenience 
in each case  we would then lose the income from that location and potentially the expected returns from prior capital expenditures 
we would also likely be in default under the loan agreements of our airport services business and be obliged to repay our lenders a portion or all of our outstanding loan amount 
the tsa is considering new regulation which could impair the relative convenience of general aviation and adversely affect demand for our airport services business 
the tsa has proposed new regulations known as the large aircraft security program lasp  which would require all us operators of general aviation aircraft exceeding  pounds maximum take off weight to implement security programs that are subject to tsa audit 
in addition  the proposed regulation would require airports servicing these aircraft to implement security programs involving additional security measures  including passenger and baggage screening 
we believe these new regulations  if implemented  will affect many of our customers and all of the airports at which we operate 
these rules  if adopted  could decrease the convenience and attractiveness of general aviation travel relative to commercial air travel and  therefore  may adversely impact demand for our airport services business 
risks related to imtt imtt s business is dependent on the demand for bulk liquid storage capacity in the locations where it operates 
demand for imtt s bulk liquid storage is largely a function of us domestic demand for chemical  petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products and  less significantly  the extent to which such products are imported into and or exported out of the united states 
us domestic demand for chemical  petroleum and v a products is influenced by a number of factors  including economic conditions  growth in the us economy  the pricing of chemical  petroleum and v a products and their substitutes 
import and export volumes of these products to and from the united states are influenced by demand and supply imbalances in the united states and overseas  the cost of producing chemical  petroleum and v a products domestically vis vis overseas and the cost of transporting the products between the united states and overseas destinations 
in addition  changes in government regulations that affect imports and exports of bulk chemical  petroleum and v a products  including the imposition of surcharges or taxes on imported or exported 
table of contents products  could adversely affect import and export volumes to and from the united states 
a reduction in demand for bulk liquid storage  particularly in the new york harbor or the lower mississippi river  as a consequence of lower us domestic demand for  or imports exports of  chemical  petroleum or v a products  could lead to a decline in storage rates and tankage volumes rented by imtt and adversely affect imtt s revenue and profitability and the distributions it makes to us 
imtt s business could be adversely affected by a substantial increase in bulk liquid storage capacity in the locations where it operates 
an increase in available bulk liquid storage capacity in excess of growth in demand for such storage in the key locations in which imtt operates  such as new york harbor and the lower mississippi river  could result in overcapacity and a decline in storage rates and tankage volumes rented by imtt and could adversely affect imtt s revenue and profitability and the distributions it makes to us 
imtt s business could be adversely affected by the insolvency of one or more large customers 
imtt has a number of customers that together generate a material proportion of imtt s revenue and gross profit 
in  imtt s ten largest customers by revenue generated approximately of total revenues 
the insolvency of any of these large customers could result in an increase in unutilized storage capacity in the absence of such capacity being rented to other customers and adversely affect imtt s revenue and profitability and the distributions it makes to us 
imtt s business involves hazardous activities  is partly located in a region with a history of significant adverse weather events and is potentially a target for terrorist attacks 
we cannot assure you that imtt is  or will be in the future  adequately insured against all such risks 
the transportation  handling and storage of petroleum  chemical and v a products are subject to the risk of spills  leakage  contamination  fires and explosions 
any of these events may result in loss of revenue  loss of reputation or goodwill  fines  penalties and other liabilities 
in certain circumstances  such events could also require imtt to halt or significantly alter operations at all or part of the facility at which the event occurred 
consistent with industry practice  imtt carries insurance to protect against most of the accident related risks involved in the conduct of the business  however  the limits of imtt s coverage mean imtt cannot insure against all risks 
in addition  because imtt s facilities are not insured against loss from terrorism or acts of war  such an attack that significantly damages one or more of imtt s major facilities would have a negative impact on imtt s future cash flow and profitability and the distributions it makes to us 
further  losses sustained by insurers during hurricanes in the us gulf region may result in lower insurance coverage and increased insurance premiums for imtt s properties in louisiana 
risks related to our gas production and distribution business our gas production and distribution business operating results are affected by hawaii s economy 
the primary driver of hawaii s economy is tourism 
a significant portion of the sales of our gas production and distribution business is generated from businesses that rely on tourism as their primary source of revenue 
these businesses include hotels and resorts  restaurants and laundries  comprising nearly half of sales 
as a result of the current economic climate  hawaii has recently experienced significant declines in levels of tourism which has affected the local economy generally and has caused declines in the business volume of gas sold 
if the level of tourism fails to improve or continues to decline  the business commercial contribution margin and profitability could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  a reduction in new housing starts and commercial development may reduce growth opportunities for the business 
our gas production and distribution business relies on its synthetic natural gas  or sng  plant  including its transmission pipeline  for a significant portion of its sales 
disruptions at that facility could adversely affect the business ability to serve customers 
disruptions at the sng plant resulting from mechanical or operational problems or power failures could affect the ability of our gas production and distribution business to produce sng 
most of the regulated sales on oahu are of sng and are produced at this plant 
disruptions to the primary and redundant production systems would have a significant adverse effect on sales and cash flows 

table of contents our gas production and distribution business depends heavily on the two oil refineries  located on the island of oahu  for both liquefied petroleum gas and the primary feedstock for its sng plant 
disruptions or shutdowns at either of those refineries may adversely affect the operations of our gas production and distribution business 
our gas production and distribution business comprises the manufacture of sng and the distribution of sng and liquefied petroleum gas  or lpg 
any feedstock  sng or lpg supply disruptions or shutdowns that limit its ability to manufacture and deliver gas to customers would adversely affect the cost of our operations 
increased costs could result from an inability to source feedstock at favorable costs  extended unavailability of one or both of the oahu refineries or disruption to crude oil supplies or feedstock to hawaii resulting in higher reliance on imports 
an inability to purchase lpg from foreign sources would materially adversely affect our operations 
in addition  because we have only one current contracted source of feedstock for our sng  if tesoro chooses to discontinue the production or sale of feedstock to us  which they could do with little notice  our utility business would suffer a significant disruption and potentially significant operating costs and capital expenditures until alternative supplies could be arranged 
our gas production and distribution business is also limited in its ability to store both foreign sourced lpg and domestic lpg at the same location at the same time and  therefore  any disruption in supply may cause a short term depletion of lpg 
all supply disruptions  if occurring for an extended period  could materially adversely impact the business contribution margin and cash flows 
the most significant costs for our gas production and distribution business are locally sourced lpg  lpg imports and feedstock for the sng plant  the costs of which are directly related to petroleum prices 
to the extent that these costs cannot be passed on to customers  the business contribution margin and cash flows will be adversely affected 
the profitability of our gas production and distribution business is based on the margin of sales prices over costs 
since lpg and feedstock for the sng plant are commodities  changes in the market for these products can have a significant impact on costs 
in addition  increased reliance on higher priced foreign sources of lpg  whether due to disruptions or shortages in local sources or otherwise  could also have a significant impact on costs 
our gas production and distribution business has no control over these costs  and  to the extent that these costs cannot be passed on to customers  the business financial condition and the results of operations would be adversely affected 
higher prices could result in reduced customer demand or could result in customer conversion to alternative energy sources 
this would reduce sales volume and adversely affect profits 
our gas production and distribution business operations on the islands of hawaii  maui and kauai rely on lpg that is transported to those islands by jones act qualified barges from oahu and from non jones act vessels from foreign ports 
disruptions to those vessels could adversely affect the business results of operations 
our gas production and distribution business has time charter agreements allowing the use of two barges that have the capability of transporting  gallons and  gallons of lpg  respectively 
the jones act requires that vessels carrying cargo between two us ports meet certain requirements 
the barges used by our gas production and distribution business are the only two jones act qualified barges available in the hawaiian islands and capable of carrying large volumes of lpg 
they are near the end of their useful economic lives  and the barge owner intends to replace one or both of them in the near future 
to the extent that the barge owner is unable to replace these barges  or alternatively  these barges are unable to transport lpg from oahu and the business is not able to secure foreign source lpg or obtain an exemption to the jones act  the storage capacity on those islands could be depleted and sales and cash flows could be adversely affected 
the recovery of amounts expended for capital projects and operating expenses in the regulated operations is subject to approval by the hawaii public utilities commission  or hpuc  which exposes our gas production and distribution business to the risk of incurring costs that may not be recoverable from regulated customers 
in the past  our gas production and distribution business has requested rate increases from the hpuc approximately every five years as its operating costs increased and as capital investments were committed 

table of contents when the hpuc approved our purchase of the business  it stipulated that no rate increase may be implemented until our gas production and distribution business is currently seeking an increase in its utility rates with interim rate increases expected as early as july however  there is a risk that the hpuc will not grant any such rate increases or it will permit only part of the increase  which may have a material adverse effect on the business financial condition and results of operations 
the non regulated operations of our gas production and distribution business are subject to a variety of competitive pressures and the actions of competitors  particularly those involved in other energy sources  could have a materially adverse effect on operating results 
in hawaii  gas is largely used by commercial and residential customers for water heating and cooking 
our gas production and distribution business also has wholesale customers that resell product to other end users 
gas end use applications may be substituted by other fuel sources such as electricity  diesel  solar and wind  particularly if the price of gas increases relative to other fuel sources  due to higher commodity supply costs or otherwise 
customers could  for a number of reasons  including increased gas prices  lower costs of alternative energy or convenience  meet their energy needs through alternative sources 
this could have an adverse effect on the business sales  revenue and cash flows 
approximately two thirds of the employees of our gas production and distribution business are members of a labor union 
a work interruption may adversely affect our gas production and distribution business 
approximately two thirds of the employees of our gas production and distribution business are covered under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on april  labor disruptions related to that contract or to other disputes could affect gas manufacturing  gas distribution systems  gas delivery and customer services 
any labor dispute  as well as the process of contract negotiations  has the potential of creating morale issues  which  if severe enough may adversely impact productivity 
because of its geographic location  hawaii  and in turn our gas production and distribution business  is subject to earthquakes and certain weather risks that could materially disrupt operations 
hawaii is subject to earthquakes and certain weather risks  such as hurricanes  floods  heavy and sustained rains and tidal waves 
because the business sng plant  sng transmission line and several storage facilities are close to the ocean  weather related disruptions are possible 
in addition  earthquakes may cause disruptions 
these events could damage its assets or could result in wide spread damage to its customers  thereby reducing sales volumes and  to the extent such damages are not covered by insurance  the business revenue and cash flows 
risks related to our district energy business pursuant to the terms of a use agreement with the city of chicago  the city of chicago has rights that  if exercised  could have a significant negative impact on our district energy business 
in order to operate our district cooling system in downtown chicago  we have obtained the right to use certain public ways of the city of chicago under a use agreement  which we refer to as the use agreement 
under the terms of the use agreement  the city of chicago retains the right to use the public ways for a public purpose and has the right in the interest of public safety or convenience to cause us to remove  modify  replace or relocate our facilities at our own expense 
if the city of chicago exercises these rights  we could incur significant costs and our ability to provide service to our customers could be disrupted  which would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the use agreement is non exclusive  and the city of chicago is entitled to enter into use agreements with our potential competitors 
the use agreement expires on december  and may be terminated by the city of chicago for any uncured material breach of its terms and conditions 
the city of chicago also may require us to pay liquidated damages of  a day if we fail to remove  modify  replace or relocate our facilities when required to do so  if we install any facilities that are not properly authorized under the use agreement or if our district cooling system does not conform to the city of chicago s standards 
each of these non compliance penalties could result in substantial financial loss or effectively shut down our district cooling system in downtown chicago 

table of contents any proposed renewal  extension or modification of the use agreement requires approval by the city council of chicago 
extensions and modifications subject to the city of chicago s approval include those to enable the expansion of chilling capacity and the connection of new customers to the district cooling system 
the city of chicago s approval is contingent upon the timely filing of an economic disclosure statement  or eds  by us and certain of the beneficial owners of our stock 
if any of these investors fails to file a completed eds form within days of the city of chicago s request or files an incomplete or inaccurate eds  the city of chicago has the right to refuse to provide the necessary approval for any extension or modification of the use agreement or to rescind the use agreement altogether 
if the city of chicago declines to approve extensions or modifications to the use agreement  we may not be able to increase the capacity of our district cooling system and pursue our growth strategy for our district energy business 
furthermore  if the city of chicago rescinds or voids the use agreement  our district cooling system in downtown chicago would be effectively shut down and our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected as a result 
certain of our investors may be required to comply with certain disclosure requirements of the city of chicago and non compliance may result in the city of chicago s rescission or voidance of the use agreement and any other arrangements our district energy business may have with the city of chicago at the time of the non compliance 
in order to secure any amendment to the use agreement with the city of chicago to pursue expansion plans or otherwise  or to enter into other contracts with the city of chicago  the city of chicago may require any person who owns or acquires or more of our llc interests to make a number of representations to the city of chicago by filing a completed eds 
our llc agreement requires that in the event that we need to obtain approval from the city of chicago in the future for any specific matter  including to expand the district cooling system or to amend the use agreement  we and each of our then investors would need to submit an eds to the city of chicago within days of the city of chicago s request 
in addition  our llc agreement requires each investor to provide any supplemental information needed to update any eds filed with the city of chicago as required by the city of chicago and as requested by us from time to time 
any eds filed by an investor may become publicly available 
by completing and signing an eds  an investor will have waived and released any possible rights or claims which it may have against the city of chicago in connection with the public release of information contained in the eds and also will have authorized the city of chicago to verify the accuracy of information submitted in the eds 
the requirements and consequences of filing an eds with the city of chicago will make compliance with the eds requirements difficult for our investors 
if any investor fails to comply with the eds requirements on time or the city of chicago determines that any information provided in any eds is false  incomplete or inaccurate  the city of chicago may rescind or void the use agreement or any other arrangements thermal chicago has with the city of chicago  and pursue any other remedies available to them 
if the city of chicago rescinds or voids the use agreement  our district cooling system in downtown chicago would be effectively shut down and our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected as a result 
if certain events within or beyond the control of our district energy business occur  our district energy business may be unable to perform its contractual obligations to provide chilling and heating services to its customers 
if  as a result  its customers elect to terminate their contracts  our district energy business may suffer loss of revenue 
in addition  our district energy business may be required to make payments to such customers for damages 
in the event of a shutdown of one or more of our district energy business plants due to operational breakdown  strikes  the inability to retain or replace key technical personnel or events outside its control  such as an electricity blackout  or unprecedented weather conditions in chicago  our district energy business may be unable to continue to provide chilling and heating services to all of its customers 
as a result  our district energy business may be in breach of the terms of some or all of its customer contracts 
in the event that such customers elect to terminate their contracts with our district energy business as a consequence of their loss of

northwind aladdin derives most of its cash flows from a contract with the planet hollywood resort and casino formerly known as the aladdin resort and casino in las vegas to supply cold and hot water and back up electricity 
the aladdin resort and casino emerged from bankruptcy immediately prior to mde s acquisition of northwind aladdin in september  and  during the course of those proceedings  the contract with northwind aladdin was amended to reduce the payment obligations of the aladdin resort and casino 
if the planet hollywood resort and casino were to enter into bankruptcy again and a cheaper source of the services that northwind aladdin provides can be found  our contract may be terminated or amended 
this could result in a total loss or significant reduction in our income from northwind aladdin  for which we may receive no compensation 
risks related to our airport parking business there is substantial doubt as to the ability of our parking business to continue as a going concern and creditors of that business may seek recourse to the company regardless of the legal merits 
the ongoing downturn in the us economy and the decline in commercial air travel have caused the results of our airport parking business to decline  particularly its revenues  ebitda and cash from operations 
in the past  the business has funded its operations in part with its own cash on hand  however  in the second and third quarters of  we contributed cash to the business to enable it to meet its liquidity requirements 
we have not contributed any cash to the business for the fourth quarter of nor do we intend to make any cash contributions to this business in the future other than potentially obligations that we have guaranteed 
it is highly likely that our airport parking business will not be able to refinance or pay its debt obligations that mature in in light of the current credit markets and performance of the airport parking business  there is substantial doubt as to the parking business ability to continue as a going concern 
upon an event of default under the airport parking business debt agreements or an insolvency  creditors of the business may choose to foreclose on or assume control of the business assets 
creditors of the business may also attempt to seek recovery from the company and  through the company  seek recourse to the assets of our other businesses  regardless of the merits of such a claim or lack thereof  which could result in substantial legal costs and significant disruption of management time and resources  thereby adversely affecting our profitability 
our airport parking business is exposed to competition from both on airport and off airport parking  which could slow our growth or harm our business 
at each of the locations at which our airport parking business operates  it competes with both on airport parking facilities  many of which are located closer to passenger terminals  and other off airport parking facilities 
if an airport expands its parking facilities or if new off airport parking facilities are opened or existing facilities expanded  customers may be drawn away from our sites or we may have to reduce our parking rates  or both 
parking rates charged by us at each of our locations are set with reference to a number of factors  including prices charged by competitors and quality of service by on airport and off airport competitors  the location and quality of the facility and the level of service provided 
additional sources of competition to our parking operations may come from new or improved transportation to the airports where our parking facilities are located 
improved rail  bus or other services may encourage our customers not to drive to the airport and therefore negatively impact revenue 

table of contents changes in regulation by airport authorities or other governmental bodies governing the transportation of customers to and from the airports at which our airport parking business operates may negatively affect our operating results 
our airport parking business shuttle operations transport customers between the airport terminals and its parking facilities and are regulated by  and are subject to  the rules and policies of the relevant local airport authority  which may be changed at their discretion 
some airport authorities levy fees on off airport parking operators for the right to transport customers to the terminals 
there is a risk that airport authorities may deny or restrict our access to terminals  impede our ability to manage our shuttle operations efficiently  impose new fees or increase the fees currently levied 
further  the faa and the transportation security administration  or tsa  regulate the operations of all the airports at which our airport parking business has locations 
the tsa has the authority to restrict access to airports as well as to impose parking and other restrictions around the airports 
the tsa could impose more stringent restrictions in the future that would inhibit the ability of customers to use our parking facilities 
risks related to ownership of our stock our manager s affiliation with macquarie group limited and the macquarie group may result in conflicts of interest or a decline in our stock price 
our manager is an affiliate of macquarie group limited and a member of the macquarie group 
from time to time  we have entered into  and in the future we may enter into  transactions and relationships involving macquarie group limited  its affiliates  or other members of the macquarie group 
such transactions have included and may include  among other things  the acquisition of businesses and investments from macquarie group members  the entry into debt facilities and derivative instruments with members of the macquarie group serving as lender or counterparty  and financial advisory services provided to us by the macquarie group 
although our audit committee  all of the members of which are independent directors  is required to approve of any related party transactions  including those involving members of the macquarie group or its affiliates  the relationship of our manager to the macquarie group may result in conflicts of interest 
in addition  as a result of our manager s being a member of the macquarie group  negative market perceptions of macquarie group limited generally or of macquarie s infrastructure management model  or macquarie group statements or actions with respect to other managed vehicles  may affect market perceptions of our company and cause a decline in the price of our llc interests unrelated to our financial performance and prospects 
in the event of the underperformance of our manager  we may be unable to remove our manager  which could limit our ability to improve our performance and could adversely affect the market price of our llc interests 
under the terms of the management services agreement  our manager must significantly underperform in order for the management services agreement to be terminated 
the company s board of directors cannot remove our manager unless our llc interests underperform a weighted average of two benchmark indices by more than in relative terms and more than in absolute terms in out of consecutive quarters prior to and including the most recent full quarter  and the holders of a minimum of of the outstanding llc interests excluding any llc interests owned by our manager or any affiliate of the manager vote to remove our manager  our manager materially breaches the terms of the management services agreement and such breach continues unremedied for days after notice  our manager acts with gross negligence  willful misconduct  bad faith or reckless disregard of its duties in carrying out its obligations under the management services agreement  or engages in fraudulent or dishonest acts  or our manager experiences certain bankruptcy events 

table of contents because our manager s performance is measured by the market performance of our llc interests relative to a weighted average of two benchmark indices  even if the absolute market performance of our llc interests does not meet expectations  the company s board of directors cannot remove our manager unless the market performance of our llc interests also significantly underperforms the weighted average of the benchmark indices 
if we were unable to remove our manager in circumstances where the absolute market performance of our llc interests does not meet expectations  the market price of our llc interests could be negatively affected 
our manager can resign on days notice and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time  resulting in a disruption in our operations which could adversely affect our financial results and negatively impact the market price of our llc interests 
our manager has the right  under the management services agreement  to resign at any time on days notice  whether we have found a replacement or not 
if our manager resigns  we may not be able to find a new external manager or hire internal management with similar expertise within days to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to do so quickly  our operations are likely to experience a disruption  our financial results could be adversely affected  perhaps materially  and the market price of our llc interests may decline substantially 
in addition  the coordination of our internal management  acquisition activities and supervision of our businesses and investments are likely to suffer if we were unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by our manager and its affiliates 
furthermore  if our manager resigns  the company and its subsidiaries will be required to cease using the macquarie brand entirely  including changing their names to remove any reference to macquarie 
this may cause the value of the company and the market price of our llc interests to decline 
certain provisions of the management services agreement and the operating agreement of the company make it difficult for third parties to acquire control of the company and could deprive you of the opportunity to obtain a takeover premium for your llc interests 
in addition to the limited circumstances in which our manager can be terminated under the terms of the management services agreement  the management services agreement provides that in circumstances where the stock ceases to be listed on a recognized us exchange as a result of the acquisition of stock by third parties in an amount that results in the stock ceasing to meet the distribution and trading criteria on such exchange or market  the manager has the option to either propose an alternate fee structure and remain our manager or resign  terminate the management services agreement upon days written notice and be paid a substantial termination fee 
the termination fee payable on the manager s exercise of its right to resign as our manager subsequent to a delisting of our llc interests could delay or prevent a change in control that may favor our shareholders 
furthermore  in the event of such a delisting  any proceeds from the sale  lease or exchange of a significant amount of assets must be reinvested in new assets of our company  subject to debt repayment obligations 
we would also be prohibited from incurring any new indebtedness or engaging in any transactions with shareholders of the company or its affiliates without the prior written approval of the manager 
these provisions could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize a premium on the llc interests owned by them 
the operating agreement of the company  which we refer to as the llc agreement  contains a number of provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or discouraging a third party from acquiring  control of the company 
these provisions include restrictions on the company s ability to enter into certain transactions with our major shareholders  with the exception of our manager  modeled on the limitation contained in section of the delaware general corporation law  allowing only the company s board of directors to fill vacancies  including newly created directorships and requiring that directors may be removed only for cause and by a shareholder vote of  requiring that only the company s chairman or board of directors may call a special meeting of our shareholders  
table of contents prohibiting shareholders from taking any action by written consent  establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to the company s board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by our shareholders at a shareholders meeting  having a substantial number of additional llc interests authorized but unissued  providing the company s board of directors with broad authority to amend the llc agreement  and requiring that any person who is the beneficial owner of or more of our llc interests make a number of representations to the city of chicago in its standard form of economic disclosure statement  or eds  the current form of which is included in our llc agreement  which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this report 
the market price and marketability of our llc interests may from time to time be significantly affected by numerous factors beyond our control  which may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through future equity financings 
the market price of our llc interests may fluctuate significantly 
many factors that are beyond our control may significantly affect the market price and marketability of our llc interests and may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through equity financings 
these factors include the following price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets generally  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of macquarie group limited and or vehicles managed by the macquarie group or branded under the macquarie name or logo  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of registered investment companies  business development companies or companies in our sectors  which may not be related to the operating performance of these companies  changes in our earnings or variations in operating results  any shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by securities analysts  changes in regulatory policies or tax law  operating performance of companies comparable to us  and loss of funding sources

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere herein 
the current economic environment and its effect on our businesses and strategy in the latter half of and continuing into  our economy has seen major financial institutions and multinational corporations face liquidity shortfalls  seek government financial support and declare bankruptcy 
these and other macroeconomic factors have resulted in decreased business activity levels generally and have adversely affected all of our businesses to some extent 
our bulk liquid storage  gas production and distribution and district energy businesses have proven resistant to the economic downturn  primarily due to the contracted or utility like nature of their revenues combined with the essential nature of the services they provide 
our airport services business results have been affected by lower overall economic activity and decreased use of general aviation jets 
however  we believe the fundamental strength of our airport services business  based on the important role of general aviation in the air transportation industry  will be sustained over the long term 
the current economic climate and our inability to accurately forecast when these conditions will improve have led us to focus more intently on managing our businesses to prudently reduce costs and operating expenditures  selectively reduce debt levels  anticipate and mitigate potential refinancing risk and conservatively approach growth expenditures 
we have taken a number of steps to retain cash  reduce debt levels in our airport services business and manage all of our businesses through the current environment 
these measures are discussed in more detail directly below and in more detail under the discussion regarding each business in results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
we believe that our active management of our businesses  along with the essential services nature of our businesses overall will enable them to continue to operate and generate cash  if at somewhat reduced levels  until economic conditions improve 
distributions our board of directors has decided to suspend payment of quarterly cash distributions to shareholders in order to reduce both holding company debt and operating company debt at businesses where the underlying fundamentals are strong 
the suspension is likely to remain in effect until such time as the credit markets and consumer spending patterns regain a level of stability and predictability that enables us to confidently estimate long term cash flows and refinancing capability 
airport services business in our airport services business  we are aggressively managing operations  debt level and liquidity position in response to the current economic climate 
we have implemented a number of measures that have successfully reduced operating expenses 
the savings have partially offset the decline in volume and margins on fuel sales that we believe have resulted from decreased general aviation activity levels 
as of september  we have reduced run rate costs by approximately million per month or approximately million on an annual basis  primarily through synergies realized in the integration of acquired sites and rationalization of staffing levels 
on february   we amended our airport services business credit facility to reduce the principal amount due under that facility and provide us additional financial flexibility over the near and medium term 
we used million in cash on hand to pay down million of the outstanding term loan debt under the facility and million of interest rate swap break fees  of which million was paid to macquarie bank limited  a related party 
additionally  under the amended terms  we will apply all excess cash flow from the business to prepay additional debt whenever the leverage ratio debt to adjusted ebitda equal to or more than x to for the trailing twelve months and will use of excess cash flow to prepay debt whenever leverage ratio is equal to or greater than x to and below x to 
table of contents airport parking business the results of operations and financial condition of our airport parking business have suffered in the wake of continuing declines in commercial enplanements and increasing tightening of consumer spending 
our airport parking business has million of total debt due on or before september  secured by the assets and other collateral of this business 
creditors of this business do not have recourse to any assets of the company or any assets of our other businesses  other than through approximately million in guarantees and interest rate swap liabilities 
the airport parking business does not have sufficient liquidity or capital resources to pay its maturing debt obligations and  based on current results and market conditions  we do not expect that the airport parking business will be able to refinance its debt as it matures 
we have notified the lenders to this business that we have no intention of contributing any further capital to this business other than potentially obligations that we have guaranteed 
as a result  it is likely that this business will default on its existing debt obligations without substantial concessions from the lenders and there is substantial doubt regarding the business ability to continue as a going concern 
we are in discussion with lenders and are pursuing strategic alternatives for this business including asset sales  restructuring plans or filing for protection under bankruptcy laws 
gas production and distribution business although our gas production and distribution business results have not been affected by the current economic climate to the same extent as our airport services and airport parking businesses  the volume of gas products sold in declined by approximately compared with  including a decline in fourth quarter over the prior period 
these declines result from lower business activity in hawaii largely caused by declines in tourism 
according to the hawaii department of business  economic development and tourism  visitor arrivals to hawaii were down by in over and are expected to decline by a further in we have implemented a number of margin management actions in the non utility part of the business to partially offset declining volumes  which we discuss in more detail below 
district energy business the macroeconomic factors and market conditions discussed above have not had a significant effect on our district energy business 
this is primarily because of the contracted nature of the business and the contractual ability to pass through most cost variances to the customer 
non cash impairment charge the decline in our stock price  particularly over the latter part of  has caused our book value to exceed our market capitalization 
as a result we have booked a non cash impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of in accordance with sfas no 
a portion of the non cash goodwill impairment charges was reflected in the financial results for both our airport services and airport parking businesses

tax treatment of distributions through the year ended december   each holder of trust stock was required to include in us federal taxable income its allocable share of the trust s income  gain  loss deductions and other items 
the amounts shareholders include in taxable income may not have equaled the cash distributions to shareholders 
the agreement reached with the irs referred to in note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k  allows the company to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes beginning january  for tax years subsequent to  shareholders need to include in taxable income the portion of our distributions characterized as a dividend 
the company has determined that of our distributions made in and all of our distributions made in were characterized as return of capital for tax purposes and will result in an adjustment to the shareholder s basis rather than taxable income 
the portion of the distribution that was characterized as a dividend was eligible for treatment as a qualified dividend 
the portion of our future distributions that will be treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes is subject to a number of uncertainties 
we currently anticipate that all of our regular distributions 
table of contents that are treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes will be eligible for treatment as qualified dividend income  subject to the shareholder having met the holding period requirements as defined by the irs 
acquisitions on december   we completed our ipo and concurrent private placement  issuing a total of  shares of trust stock at a price of per share

as a result of this transaction  we own of imtt holdings issued and outstanding common stock 
gas production and distribution business we acquired tgc on june  tgc owns and operates the sole regulated synthetic natural gas production and distribution business in hawaii and distributes and sells liquefied petroleum gas through unregulated operations 
airport parking business in october  our airport parking business acquired real property  and personal and intangible assets related to six off airport parking facilities collectively referred to as sunpark as well as a leasehold facility in cleveland 
our airport parking business also acquired a facility in philadelphia in july in  our airport parking business acquired a facility in oakland and a facility in newark 
following these acquisitions  our airport parking business has become the largest provider of off airport parking services in the united states with facilities at airports across the united states 
see note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for further information on recent acquisitions and note  long term debt  for information on the related financings 

table of contents equity offerings during the fourth quarter of  we completed an offering of an aggregate of  shares of trust stock at a price per share of for which we received net proceeds of million 
the net cash proceeds from the equity offering and the sales of our interests in mcg and sew were primarily used to repay in full indebtedness under the mic inc revolving credit facility used to partially finance our acquisitions of imtt  tgc and fbos in our airport services business 
in the third quarter of  we completed an offering of an aggregate of  llc interests at a price per interest of for which we received proceeds of million  net of underwriting fees and expenses 
the net cash proceeds from the equity offering were used to partially finance the acquisitions of mercury and san jose within our airport services business 
we did not undertake any offering of additional equity in impact of acquisitions on our results of operations results of the operations of each of our acquisitions are included in our consolidated results from the respective date of each acquisition 
these acquisitions resulted in significant increases in the recorded value of our property  equipment  land and leasehold interests in our intangible assets  including goodwill  airport contract rights  customer relationships and technology  and in depreciation and amortization expense 
our acquisition of of imtt holdings is reflected in our equity in earnings losses and amortization charges of investee line in our financial statements from may  we have financed a significant portion of our acquisitions with debt incurred at the business segment level  other than our investment in imtt 
the increased levels of debt have resulted in significant increases in interest expense from the respective date of each acquisition 
operating segments and businesses airport services business the performance of our airport services business depends upon the level of general aviation activity  and jet fuel consumption  for the largest portion of its gross profit 
general aviation activity is in turn a function of economic activity and demographic trends in the regions serviced by the airport at which the business operates and the general level of economic activity in the united states 
a number of these airports are located near key business centers such as new york  ny  chicago  il and philadelphia  pa as well as recreational destinations such as aspen  colorado and sun valley  idaho 
we believe that the popularity of these destinations relative to general aviation destinations overall will continue to support an above average level of general aviation activity and jet fuel consumption 
fuel gross profit is a function of the volume gallons sold and the average dollar margin per gallon 
the average price per gallon is based on our cost of fuel plus  where applicable  fees and taxes paid to airports or other local authorities cost of revenue fuel  plus our margin 
the dollar based margin varies based on business considerations 
dollar based margins per gallon have been relatively insensitive to the wholesale price of fuel with both increases and decreases in the wholesale price of fuel generally passed through to customers  subject to the level of price competition that exists at the various fbos 
recent volatility in the price of jet fuel has resulted in an increased sensitivity to price on the part of some customers and a corresponding compression of our margins 
our airport services business also earns revenue from activities other than fuel sales non fuel revenue 
for example  we earn revenue from refuelling some general aviation customers and some commercial airlines on a pass through basis  where we act as a fuelling agent for fuel suppliers and for commercial airlines 
we receive a fee for this service  generally calculated on a per gallon basis 
in addition  the business earns revenue from aircraft parking and hangar rental fees and by providing general aviation customers with other services  such as de icing 
at some facilities we also provide de icing services to commercial airlines 
expenses associated with non fuel revenue cost of revenue non fuel include de icing fluid costs and payments to airport authorities which vary from site to site 
cost of revenue non fuel is directly related to the volume of services provided and therefore generally increases in line with non fuel revenue in dollar terms 

table of contents our airport services business incurs expenses in operating and maintaining each fbo 
operating expenses include rent and insurance  which are generally fixed in nature and other expenses  such as salaries  that generally increase with the level of activity 
in addition  our airport services business incurs general and administrative expenses at the head office that include senior management expenses as well as accounting  information technology  human resources  environmental compliance and other corporate costs 
bulk liquid storage terminal business imtt provides bulk liquid storage and handling services in north america through ten terminals located on the east  west and gulf coasts  the great lakes region of the united states and partially owned terminals in quebec and newfoundland  canada 
the company has its largest terminals in the strategically key locations of new york harbor and the lower mississippi river near new orleans 
imtt stores and handles petroleum products  various chemicals  renewable fuels  and vegetable and animal oils and  based on storage capacity  operates one of the largest third party bulk liquid storage terminal businesses in the united states 
the key drivers of imtt s revenue and gross profit include the amount of tank capacity rented to customers and the rental rates 
customers generally rent tanks under contracts with terms of between three and five years that require payment regardless of actual tank usage 
demand for storage capacity within a particular region eg new york harbor serves as the key driver of storage capacity utilization and tank rental rates 
this demand for capacity reflects both the level of consumption of the bulk liquid products stored by the terminals as well as import and export activity of such products 
we believe major constraint on increases in the supply of new bulk liquid storage capacity in imtt s key markets has been and will continue to be limited by the availability of waterfront land with access to the infrastructure necessary for land based receipt and distribution of stored product road  rail and pipelines  lengthy environmental permitting processes and high capital costs 
we believe a favorable supply demand balance for bulk liquid storage currently exists in the markets serviced by imtt s major facilities 
this condition  when combined with the attributes of imtt s facilities such as deep water drafts and access to land based infrastructure  have allowed imtt to increase prices while maintaining very high storage capacity utilization rates 
imtt earns revenue at its terminals from a number of sources including storage of bulk liquids per barrel  per month rental  throughput of liquids handling charges  heating a pass through of the cost associated with heating liquids to prevent excessive viscosity and other revenue from blending  packaging and warehousing  for example 
most customer contracts include provisions for annual price increases based on inflation 
in operating its terminals  imtt incurs labor costs  fuel costs  repair and maintenance costs  real and personal property taxes and other costs which include insurance and other operating costs such as utilities and inventory used in packaging and drumming activities 
in  imtt generated approximately of its total terminal revenue and approximately of its terminal gross profit at its bayonne  nj facility  which services new york harbor  and approximately of its total terminal revenue and approximately of its terminal gross profit at its st 
rose  gretna  avondale and geismar  la facilities  which together service the lower mississippi river region with st 
rose being the largest contributor 
two key factors will likely have a material impact on imtt s total terminal revenue and terminal gross profit in the future 
first  imtt has achieved substantial increases in storage rates at its bayonne and louisiana facilities over the past few years 
based on the current level of demand for bulk liquid storage in new york harbor and the lower mississippi river  we anticipate that imtt will achieve annual increases in average storage rates in excess of inflation at least through second  imtt has committed to significant growth capital expenditure over the past year that should contribute to terminal gross profit in and beyond as discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
as prescribed in the shareholders agreement between us  imtt holdings and its other shareholders  until december   imtt holdings was required to distribute million per quarter to us 
we received million in cash distributions during  including million that was accrued at the end of at december   we accrued million for the fourth quarter distribution  which was received in january subsequent to december   subject to the preconditions discussed in 
table of contents business bulk liquid storage terminal business shareholders agreement and subject to imtt holdings consolidated adjusted net debt excluding shareholder loans to ebitda ratio not exceeding as at each quarter end  imtt holdings is required to distribute  quarterly  all of its consolidated cash flow from operations and cash flows from but not used in investing activities less maintenance and environmental remediation capital expenditure to its shareholders 
however  we may agree to reduce the level of distributions actually paid by imtt during and beyond below the amount prescribed by the shareholders agreement after consideration of  among other factors  the outlook for bulk liquid storage market conditions  the level of imtt s indebtedness and the availability of external sources of funding for growth capital projects 
in particular  as discussed further in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources in part i  item for bulk liquid storage terminal business  the level of distributions anticipated to be paid by imtt in and is highly dependent upon the raising of additional debt to fund committed growth projects and scheduled debt amortizations during and based on current market conditions and assuming completion during of some of the expansion projects currently under construction  it is anticipated that imtt s gross profit and ebitda will increase to ranges of million to million and million to million  respectively in increased maintenance and environmental capital expenditure and capitalized dredging expenditure in is anticipated to reduce imtt s cash available for distribution in to a range of million to million 
imtt anticipates that gross profit  ebitda and cash available for distribution will increase from in due to the positive impact of a full year contribution from growth projects coming on line part way through and a contribution from growth projects coming on line in our interest in imtt holdings  from the date of closing our acquisition  may   is reflected in our equity in earnings and amortization charges of investee line in our consolidated statements of operations 
cash distributions received by us in excess of our equity in imtt s earnings and amortization charges are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows from investing activities under return on investment in unconsolidated business 
gas production and distribution business tgc is a hawaii limited liability company that owns and operates the regulated synthetic natural gas production and distribution business in hawaii and distributes and sells liquefied petroleum gas through unregulated operations 
tgc operates in both regulated and unregulated markets on the islands of oahu  hawaii  maui  kauai  molokai and lanai 
the hawaii market includes hawaii s approximately million residents and its approximately million annual visitors 
tgc has two primary businesses utility or regulated and non utility or unregulated 
the utility business includes distribution and sales of sng on the island of oahu and distribution and sale of lpg through localized distribution systems located on the islands of oahu  hawaii  maui  kauai  molokai and lanai listed by size of market 
the utility business serves approximately  customers 
utility revenue consists principally of sales of thermal units  or therms  of sng and gallons of lpg 
one gallon of lpg is the equivalent of therms 
the operating costs for the utility business include the cost of locally purchased feedstock  the cost of manufacturing sng from the feedstock  the cost of lpg and the cost of distributing sng and lpg to customers 
the non utility business comprises the sale of lpg through truck deliveries to individual tanks located on customer sites on oahu  hawaii  maui  kauai  molokai and lanai 
the non utility business serves approximately  customers 
non utility revenue consists of sales of gallons of lpg 
the operating costs for the non utility business include the cost of purchased lpg and the cost of distributing the lpg to customers 
sng and lpg have a wide number of commercial and residential applications  including electricity generation  water heating  drying  cooking  and decorative lighting 
lpg is also used as a fuel for some automobiles  and specialty vehicles such as forklifts 
gas customers range from residential customers for which tgc has nearly all of the market  to a wide variety of commercial customers 

table of contents revenue is primarily a function of the volume of sng and lpg consumed by customers and the price per thermal unit or gallon charged to customers 
because both sng and lpg are derived from crude oil  revenue levels  without volume changes  will generally track global oil prices 
utility revenue includes fuel adjustment charges through which the changes in feedstock costs are passed through to utility customers 
evaluating the performance of this business based on contribution margin removes the volatility associated with fluctuations in the price of feedstock 
volume is primarily driven by the tourism industry and economic growth in the state of hawaii and by shifts of end users between gas and other energy sources and competitors 
in  tourism declined sharply in the wake of the broader economic slowdown and the decline had an impact on the volume of gas consumed by tourism dependent businesses such as restaurants and resorts hotels 
according to the state of hawaii department of business and economic development and tourism dbedt  visitor arrivals  one measure of the health of the tourism industry  decreased by approximately in from in  dbedt expects visitor arrivals to decline by a further 
there are approximately entities regulated by the hawaii public utilities commission  or hpuc  excluding transportation businesses 
they include one gas utility  four electric utilities  water and sewage utilities and telecommunications utilities 
the four electric utility operators  combined  serve approximately  customers 
since all businesses and residences have electric service  this provides an estimate of the total market size 
tgc s regulated customer base is approximately  accounts and its non regulated customer base is approximately  accounts 
accordingly  tgc s overall market penetration  as a percentage of total electric utility customers in hawaii  is approximately of all businesses and residences 
tgc has of hawaii s regulated gas business and approximately of hawaii s unregulated gas business 
prices charged by tgc to its customers for the utility gas business are based on hpuc regulated rates that allow tgc the opportunity to recover its costs of providing utility gas service  including operating expenses and taxes  and capital investments through recovery of depreciation and a return on the capital invested 
tgc s rate structure generally allows it to maintain a relatively consistent dollar based margin per thermal unit by passing increases or decreases in fuel costs through to customers via fuel adjustment charges without filing a general rate case 
in august  tgc submitted its application for an increase in its utility rates 
if approved  the new rates could be effective as early as july the rate case application is currently under review by the hpuc and independent consumer advocate 
the outcome of the company s rate application cannot be estimated 
the rates that are charged to non utility customers are based on the cost of lpg plus delivery costs  and on the cost of alternative fuels and competitive factors 
tgc incurs expenses in operating and maintaining its facilities and distribution network  comprising a sng plant  a mile transmission line   miles of distribution pipelines  several tank storage facilities and a fleet of vehicles 
these costs are generally fixed in nature 
other operating expenses incurred  such as for lpg  feedstock for the sng plant and revenue based taxes  generally fluctuate with the volume of product sold 
in addition  tgc incurs general and administrative expenses at its executive office that include expenses for senior management  accounting  information technology  human resources  environmental compliance  regulatory compliance  employee benefits  rents  utilities  insurance and other normal business costs 
as part of the regulatory approval process of our acquisition of tgc  we agreed to regulatory conditions addressing a variety of matters 
the more significant conditions include the non recoverability of goodwill  transaction or transition costs in future rate cases  a requirement to limit tgc and hgc s ratio of consolidated debt to total capital to  and  a requirement to maintain million in readily available cash resources at tgc  hgc or the company 
district energy business our district energy business consists of thermal chicago and northwind aladdin  which are and indirectly owned by us 
thermal chicago sells chilled water under long term contracts to approximately customers in downtown chicago and one customer outside of the downtown area 
under the long term 
table of contents contracts  thermal chicago receives both capacity and consumption payments 
capacity payments cooling capacity revenue are received regardless of the volume of chilled water used by a customer and these payments generally increase in line with inflation 
consumption payments cooling consumption revenue are per unit charges for the volume of chilled water used 
such payments are higher in the second and third quarters of each year when the demand for building cooling is at its highest 
consumption payments also fluctuate moderately from year to year depending on weather conditions 
by contract  consumption payments generally increase in line with a number of indices that reflect the cost of electricity  labor and other input costs relevant to the operations of thermal chicago 
the weighting of the individual indices broadly reflects the composition of thermal chicago s direct expenses 
thermal chicago s principal direct expense is electricity 
other direct expenses are labor  operations and maintenance and depreciation and accretion 
electricity usage fluctuates in line with the volume of chilled water produced 
thermal chicago focuses on minimizing the cost of electricity consumed per unit of chilled water produced by operating its plants to maximize efficient use of electricity 
other direct expenses are largely fixed regardless of the volumes of chilled water produced 
in  the illinois electricity generation market was deregulated 
thermal chicago has entered into a contract with a retail energy supplier to provide the majority of our electricity in at a fixed price 
electricity for one of our plants is purchased by our landlord customer and the cost is passed through to us 
we estimate our electricity costs will increase by approximately over and we will pass the increase through to customers 
we will need to enter into supply contracts for and subsequent years and prices will fluctuate based on underlying power costs 
under its customer contracts  northwind aladdin receives monthly fixed payments totaling approximately million per annum through march and monthly fixed payments totaling approximately million per year thereafter through february in january  northwind aladdin signed another contract with a new customer providing for incremental monthly fixed payments totaling  in and  per annum from through march in addition  northwind aladdin receives consumption and other variable payments from its customers that allow it to recover substantially all of its operating costs 
airport parking business the revenue of our airport parking business is highly correlated with the number of passengers boarding flights in the airport markets in which we operate 
as discussed in prior filings  in the second quarter of  our airport parking business saw its revenue trends turn negative as the us airline industry experienced a number of bankruptcies and various airlines reduced passenger capacity significantly 
these trends continued during the third quarter and accelerated in the fourth quarter as the us economy slowed and business and leisure travel declined further 
our revised expectations of enplanement growth and the consequential downward revision of our cash flow projections triggered an impairment analysis of our airport parking business 
see critical accounting estimates and note  intangible assets  of our consolidated financial statements included in this form k for a discussion of the impairment analysis 
results of operations key factors affecting operating results non cash impairment charges of million at our airport services business  consisting of million related to goodwill  million related to intangible assets and million related to property  equipment  land and leasehold improvements  and million at our airport parking business  consisting of million to goodwill  million to property  equipment  land and leasehold improvements and million to intangible assets  positive contributions to our results arising from the acquisitions of fbos during and three fbos in the first quarter of  partially offset by a decline in performance at existing locations  performance fees to our manager of million for the first half of due to the out performance of our stock price versus the benchmark index  that did not recur in  loss on extinguishment of debt in  relating to the refinancing of our airport services and district energy businesses  which did not recur in  and increased interest expense due to higher levels of debt from acquisition financing and debt refinancings completed in

airport services business year ended december  compared to year ended december  the overall decline in economic activity in the us has resulted in a decrease in the use of general aviation jet aircraft by some corporations and individuals 
activity at airports at which our airport services business operates was down by in compared with  as measured by the number of flight movements 
this compares favorably with estimates of an industry wide decrease in general aviation jet flight operations of 
the relatively better performance at the airports in our portfolio reflects the popularity of the destinations at which our business operates 
the industry wide decline in flight activity accelerated in the last quarter of and was down in november compared with november of the decrease in flight activity was not as severe in december with a decline of versus the prior comparable period 
flight activity at the airports at which we operate were down in december versus december we believe industry wide flight activity in january was consistent with the level reported in december 
table of contents flight movements and the volume of fuel sold are not directly correlated as other factors  such as the size of the aircraft in use  can significantly affect jet fuel consumption 
for example  in the reduction in flight movements has been driven by a curtailment of activity by smaller jets that use less fuel and  therefore  the impact on fuel volume consumed has been less than the reduction in total activity 
the decline in general aviation jet flight activity at airports in our network resulted in a decline in the volume of general aviation fuel sold in compared to in addition to the decline in the volume of fuel sold  the business has also experienced some compression of average margins on fuel sales 
margin compression has resulted in part from an increased percentage of purchases by base tenants compared to transient customers  as base tenants tend to pay lower average margins 
the increase in purchases made by base tenants relative to transient customers reversed trends we experienced in some of our competitors are pursuing more aggressive pricing strategies  which have led to increased margin pressure at some of our locations 
margin compression has also resulted from management decisions to convert some customers from retail sales to into plane contract sales where credit card fees on the retail sale would have reduced profitability by more than the lower average margin on the into plane sale 
management of the airport services business has successfully reduced expenses and partially offset the decline in volume and margins on fuel sales 
as of september  we have reduced run rate costs by approximately million per month  primarily through synergies realized in the integration of acquired sites and rationalization of staffing levels 
the decline in our stock price  particularly over the latter part of  has caused our book value to exceed our market capitalization 
as a result we have booked a non cash impairment charge to goodwill of million in our airport services business in the fourth quarter of in accordance with sfas no

table of contents revenue and gross profit the majority of the revenue and gross profit in our airport services business is generated through fuelling general aviation aircraft at our fixed base operations around the united states 
this revenue is categorized according to who owns the fuel we use to service these aircraft 
if we own the fuel  we record our cost to purchase that fuel as cost of revenue fuel 
our corresponding fuel revenue is our cost to purchase that fuel plus a margin 
we generally pursue a strategy of maintaining  and where appropriate increasing  dollar based margins  thereby passing any increase or decrease in fuel prices through to the customer 
we also have into plane arrangements whereby we fuel aircraft with fuel owned by another party 
we collect a fee for this service that is recorded as non fuel revenue 
other non fuel revenue includes various services such as hangar rentals  ramp fees and de icing 
cost of revenue non fuel includes our cost  if any  to provide these services 
the key factors behind changes in revenue and gross profit are fuel volume and our dollar based margin per gallon 
this applies to both fuel and into plane revenue 
our customers will occasionally move from one category to the other 
therefore  we believe discussing our fuel and non fuel revenue and gross profit and the related metrics on a combined basis provides a more meaningful analysis of our airport services business 
the growth in gross profit at all sites was primarily due to the inclusion of the results of sites acquired in and gross profit at existing locations decreased mainly due to lower fuel volume resulting from lower general aviation activity declines of and for the quarter and the year  respectively and lower average general aviation fuel margins 
gross profit from other services at existing locations increased by in as a result of higher de icing revenue and hangar rentals in the first half of the year 
for the quarter ended december   gross profit from other services declined as a result of lower general aviation traffic 
we attribute the volume decline primarily to a decrease in general aviation transient traffic 
we believe the decline in transient traffic is due primarily to overall soft economic conditions 
the slowing economy has contributed to a general decrease in corporate activity and reduction in business related general aviation activity 
the continuation or worsening of the current economic conditions could exacerbate this effect on our business 
while we seek to maintain or increase a dollar based margin per gallon backed by a premium services offering  increased fuel prices that peaked in mid led to an increased focus on cost by some of our customers 
these customers negotiated more aggressively on fuel purchases and contributed to a decrease in our average margins through the third quarter 
declining fuel price in the fourth quarter had a favorable impact on average fuel margins 
in addition  some of our competitors are pursuing more aggressive pricing strategies that have also contributed to increased margin pressure 
selling  general and administrative expenses the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses at existing locations for the year ended december  is due primarily to cost efficiencies resulting from integration of recently acquired businesses and management s actions to streamline our cost structure in response to the decline in gross profit resulting from the overall slowing of the economy 
for the quarter ended december   selling  general and administrative expense decreased at our existing locations by million or   primarily as a result of the cost reduction initiatives 
declining fuel prices contributed approximately  to the decrease in operating costs in the fourth quarter due to a reduction in credit card fees 
the majority of the ongoing savings were fully realized during the third quarter and therefore are not completely reflected in the full year results 
goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed our annual impairment test at the reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of goodwill is considered impaired when the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  as determined under a two step approach 
based on the testing performed  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million during 
table of contents depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to a non cash impairment charge of million  consisting of million related to contractual arrangements and million related to property  equipment  land and leasehold improvements at our airport services business  during the fourth quarter of amortization expense of included a million non cash impairment charge relating to airport management contracts at our airport services business 
these management contracts were subsequently sold in interest expense  net the increase in interest expense in is due to the increased debt levels used to finance a portion of our acquisitions and growth capital expenditures  as well as the refinancing of the business debt facilities in october the refinancing consolidated all borrowings outstanding at the time 
ebitda excluding the non cash losses stemming from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments in and  goodwill impairment in and the loss on debt extinguishment in  ebitda at existing locations would have decreased by and for the year and the quarter  respectively 
ebitda at all locations would have increased for the year and decreased the fourth quarter 
the ebitda decline is driven by a decrease in gross profit partially offset by cost savings 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following section summarizes the historical consolidated financial performance of our airport services business for the year ended december  and the acquisition column and the total with the remainder of the year and the corresponding period in included in existing locations results in the table below include the operating results for trajen for the period january  to june   supermarine for the period may  to december   mercury for the period august  to december   san jose for the period august  to december   and rifle for the period november  to december  key factors affecting operating results contribution of positive operating results from acquisitions completed in and  higher dollar per gallon fuel margins at existing locations  higher non military fuel volumes at existing locations  increased de icing revenue in the first quarter of as a result of colder winter in the northeast region of the country  and  higher expenses related to increased borrowings for acquisitions in completed in may and august

our customers will occasionally move from one category to the other 
therefore  we believe discussing our fuel and non fuel revenue and gross profit and the related key metrics on a combined basis provides a more meaningful analysis of our airport services business 
our total gross profit growth was due to several factors inclusion of the results of acquisitions  higher non military fuel volumes for existing locations  an increase in average dollar per gallon fuel margins at existing locations  resulting largely from a higher proportion of transient customers  which generally pay higher margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the addition of expense associated with the integration and rebranding of the acquired locations 
the increase at our existing locations was a result of increased compensation expense  including non cash benefits  in addition to higher credit card fees and increased maintenance and repair costs 
interest expense  net the increase in total interest expense was due to the increased debt level associated with acquisitions in  including borrowings of million to partially finance our acquisition of supermarine  borrowings of million to partially finance our acquisition of mercury and borrowings of million to partially finance our acquisition of san jose

table of contents revenue and gross profit the increase in terminal revenue reflects growth in all major service segments 
storage revenue grew as the average rental rates charged to customers increased by during the increase in storage revenue also reflected a increase in storage capacity rented to customers for  as the business completed certain expansion projects and reported contributions from a facility acquired in november in addition  the commencement of storage and related logistics services for our principal customer at the new geismar  la terminal contributed million to terminal revenue in storage capacity utilization  defined as storage capacity rented divided by total capacity available  remained relatively constant at during and increases in terminal revenue were offset by higher operating costs relating to the commencement of operations at geismar  la  the increase in storage capacity and throughput associated with the expansion of existing facilities  the acquisition of a new facility at joliet in november and imtt s extensive tank inspection and repair program being undertaken in la 
also operating costs in were increased by a million excise tax settlement related to imtt s handling of alcohol during and a million accrual for a potential air emission fee at bayonne 
please see legal proceedings in part i  item for discussion on the air emission fee 
revenue and gross profit from environmental response services increased substantially during due to the central role played by oil mop in the response activities following the july fuel oil spill on the mississippi river near new orleans 
oil mop generated million in revenue from spill response work and ancillary services in general and administrative expenses increased general and administrative costs during resulted from an exchange rate loss recorded for the quebec facility consolidation  bad debt reserve for customers under bankruptcy protection and increased overhead costs due to the significant increase in environmental response activity 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by million as imtt completed several major expansion projects 
interest expense  net interest costs increased during primarily due to higher borrowings incurred to fund growth capital expenditures 
loss on extinguishment of debt loss on extinguishment of debt in comprised a million make whole payment associated with the repayment of the two tranches of senior notes in conjunction with the establishment of a new million revolving credit facility 
other income other income for declined primarily due to gains from insurance settlements in which did not reoccur in unrealized losses gains on derivative instruments on october   imtt adopted hedge accounting and designated its day libor based interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments indexed to day libor under its revolving credit facility 
imtt also designated its day libor based interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments indexed to day libor under its term loan facility 
finally  imtt designated its interest rate swaps indexed to of day libor as cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments indexed to the bond market association municipal swap index bma under its go zone and new jersey bonds 
as discussed below  the resulting quarterly non cash derivative loss of million is primarily due to hedge accounting treatment of imtt s revolving credit facility and go zone bonds hedge relationships 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  imtt elected to pay interest indexed to the day libor rate on its revolving credit facility  rather than the day libor rate  which resulted in the loss of hedge accounting on this interest rate swap between october and november  during this period  the entire fair value movement of million on this derivative instrument was recognized as a loss 
on december   a new hedge relationship was created to hedge all forecasted interest payments on this facility and thereby qualifying it for hedge accounting 
this resulted in the hedge relationship being highly effective between december and december   with million of the fair value movement during this period recognized as other comprehensive income and the remaining million of the fair value movement recognized as a loss 
for the quarter ended december   the hedge relationship on the go zone bonds was ineffective for hedge accounting purposes 
as a result  the entire derivative fair value movement of million during the fourth quarter of was recorded as a loss 
ebitda excluding unrealized losses on derivative instruments  ebitda for would have increased by 
ebitda for includes the million make whole payment from the refinancing  which did not recur in ebitda 
excluding both these factors  the equity in earnings to mic would have increased by

quebec in thousands unaudited total revenue     total operating costs    total gross profit     operating income     ebitda     to provide a more meaningful comparison of current and previous year results  the following discussion and analysis of financial results will compare the imtt excluding quebec results to the actual results 
revenue and gross profit terminal revenue increased  reflecting an increase of million in storage revenue as well as growth in every other major service segment 
in contracts signed during  imtt often achieved substantial rate increases 
as a result  the average rental rates charged to customers increased by over the previous year 
storage capacity rented increased by while utilization during reached compared to during the previous year 
in addition to increased storage revenue  terminal revenue growth also benefited from increases of million in throughput and million in heating charges 
other services and fees increased million due to increased packaging activities at lemont  charges for dock usage at geismar  and customer reimbursements for capital projects completed at bayonne  which are recognized ratably as revenue over the contract term 
gross profit from terminal services increased  reflecting the increase in terminal revenue partially offset by increased operating costs 
direct labor costs rose as staffing 
table of contents increased to accommodate expansion projects at st 
rose and the pending start up of the geismar site 
repair and maintenance expenses increased due to higher cleaning costs associated with tank inspections 
increased packaging activities at lemont also increased expenses related to packaging consumables 
the increase in costs along with revenue resulted in a limited increase in gross margin 
going forward  we anticipate that costs will increase at a slower rate than revenue and gross margin will increase as a result 
revenue from environmental response services increased by million  reflecting increases in materials sales and other services partially offset by decreased revenue from spill response 
this shift in revenue mix accounted for the million decrease in gross profit from environmental response services 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by million as imtt completed several capacity expansion projects and other major capital expenditures 
interest expense  net interest expense decreased due to the repayment of higher rate private placement debt with lower rate debt from the new revolving credit facility in june subsequently  the issuance of low interest go zone bonds in july allowed imtt to repay debt obtained through the new revolving credit facility 
loss on extinguishment of debt during the second quarter  imtt repaid two tranches of senior notes in conjunction with the establishment of a new million revolving credit facility 
as a result  imtt incurred a million loss on extinguishment of debt as a result of the associated make whole payment 
other income during  other income increased by million over the previous year due to gains of million on insurance settlements received for claims related to hurricane katrina and a reduction in losses from the nursery operations partially offset by favorable legal settlements and the write off of payables during unrealized losses gains on derivative instruments as part of financing activities during  imtt entered into additional interest rate swap arrangements to fix the effective interest rate on the new debt facilities 
imtt did not apply hedge accounting 
as a result  movements in the fair value of interest rate derivatives held by imtt were taken through earnings and reported in the unrealized losses gains on derivative instruments line in the imtt financial statements 
ebitda excluding non cash losses gains on derivative instruments and the loss on extinguishment of debt  ebitda would have increased by approximately  primarily due to the increase in gross profit discussed above 
gas production and distribution business we completed our acquisition of tgc on june  and tgc contributed to our consolidated operating results from that date 
because tgc s results of operations are only included in our consolidated financial results for less than seven months of  the following analysis compares the historical results of operations for tgc under its current and prior owner 
we believe that this is the most appropriate approach to analyzing the historical financial performance and trends of tgc 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  key factors affecting operating results decreased utility contribution margin due principally to lower volume of gas sold  and increased non utility contribution margin primarily due to price increases during  partially offset by higher cost of fuel and increased costs to deliver lpg to oahu s neighboring islands 
management analyzes contribution margin for tgc because it believes that contribution margin  although a non gaap measure  is useful and meaningful to understanding the performance of tgc utility operations under its regulated rate structure and of its non utility operations under a competitive pricing structure 
both structures provide the business with an ability to change rates when underlying feedstock costs change 
contribution margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income  or net income  which are determined in accordance with us gaap 
we calculate contribution margin as revenue less direct costs of revenue other than production and transmission and distribution costs 
other companies may calculate contribution margin differently or may use different metrics and  therefore  the contribution margin presented for tgc is not necessarily comparable with metrics of other companies

corporate allocation expense  and the federal tax effect  have been excluded from the above table as they are eliminated on consolidation at the mic inc level 

table of contents contribution margin and operating income utility contribution margin decreased primarily due to lower volume of gas sold 
sales volume in was approximately lower than prior to the third quarter of  a portion of utility customer fuel cost adjustments was offset by withdrawals from an acquisition funded escrow account that was fully exhausted in the second quarter of for and  withdrawals of million and million  respectively  were recorded in cash flows from operating activities 
non utility contribution margin increased due to customer price increases  partially offset by higher costs of lpg and increases in the cost to transport lpg between islands 
the volume of gas products sold in was approximately lower than we believe a number of factors such as rising energy prices over the last several years and a decline in tourism have contributed to a softening in the hawaii economy 
while recent energy prices have declined  we have yet to see a return to consumption at previous levels and our volumes could continue to trend downward 
this is reflected in lower usage of gas for cooking  laundry services and water heating in tourism related businesses 
additionally  sng and lpg are impacted by world oil prices 
we pass through these costs in our utility business 
for our non utility business  the pass through of these costs depends on competitive pressures 
the softening of hawaii s economy is reflected in a growing trend of business layoffs  closures and bankruptcies  some of which are customers of tgc 
as a result of these conditions  we believe that will present challenges to maintaining the operating results achieved during production costs increased primarily due to higher electricity  material and personnel costs 
transmission and distribution costs were lower due principally to lower costs related to the completion of the government required pipeline inspection  and lower adjustment to reserves for asset retirement costs  partially offset by higher personnel and rent costs 
selling  general and administrative costs were higher due to an increase in bad debt expenses due to bankruptcies and business closures  higher personnel costs  including overtime and fewer vacancies  higher employee benefit costs  including pension expense  and higher professional services costs 
interest expense  net interest expense increased due to higher outstanding borrowings for utility capital expenditures during ebitda ebitda was higher in compared with primarily due to non utility operating results partially offset by higher selling  general and administration costs and lower utility operating results 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  contribution margin and operating income the utility contribution margin increased primarily due to the non recurrence of million of customer rebates that were made in as required by hawaii state regulators as a condition of our purchase of tgc  partially offset by higher fuel cost adjustments in as these adjustments commenced in june upon our acquisition  and customer mix of lower margin sales 
the cash effect of the fuel cost adjustments was offset by withdrawals from an escrow account that was established and funded at acquisition by the seller 
tgc believes that these escrowed funds will be fully utilized by mid and thereafter escrowed funds would not be available 
the cash reimbursements of the customer rebate and any fuel cost adjustment amounts are not reflected in revenue  but rather are reflected as releases of restricted cash and other assets 
therm sales for the utility operations were slightly higher than in  however  this was primarily from lower margin customers 
the non utility contribution margin increased due to customer price increases and 
table of contents slightly higher therm sales  partially offset by higher costs of lpg and increases in the cost to transport lpg between islands 
production costs were higher due primarily to higher rent and personnel costs  partially offset by lower electricity and materials costs 
transmission and distribution costs were higher due principally to higher personnel costs  adjustments to reserves for asset retirement costs and government required pipeline inspection costs 
selling  general and administrative costs were higher due to higher personnel  employee benefits and professional service costs 
the costs in included overhead charges by the prior parent company during the period of their ownership in depreciation and amortization increased due to the higher asset basis that resulted from our purchase of tgc and for capital additions 
interest expense  net interest expense increased due to our acquisition funding 
interest expense in included the prior owner s write off of deferred financing costs for the retirement of their debt in connection with their sale of the business 
other expense income other expense for included million of transaction costs incurred prior to our ownership 
ebitda ebitda was higher in compared with excluding the effects of the customer rebates and non cash derivative losses  ebitda would have decreased by approximately 
district energy business customers of our district energy business pay two charges to receive chilled water services a fixed charge  or capacity charge  and a variable charge  or consumption charge 
cooling capacity revenue is based on the maximum amount of chilled water that we have contracted to make available to a customer at any point in time and is generated irrespective of the volume of chilled water used by a customer 
capacity charges are typically adjusted annually at a fixed rate or are indexed to the consumer price index cpi 
cooling consumption revenue is a variable charge based on the volume of chilled water actually used during a billing period 
cooling consumption revenue and the related direct costs vary within a relatively predictable range 
per ton consumption charges are generally linked to changes in a number of economic factors 
the terms of our customer contracts provide for the pass through of increases or decreases in our electricity costs  the largest component of our direct expenses 
we believe that our district energy business will continue to generate stable cash flows and revenue due to both the nature of these two charges and the long term contractual relationship with our customers 
we are not subject to specific government regulation  but our downtown chicago operations are operated subject to the terms of a use agreement with the city of chicago 
the use agreement establishes the rights and obligations of our district energy business and the city of chicago for the utilization of certain public ways of the city of chicago for the operation of our district cooling system 
under the use agreement  we have a non exclusive right to construct  install  repair  operate and maintain the plants  facilities and piping essential in providing district cooling chilled water service to customers 
during the third quarter of  the chicago city council approved amendment to our use agreement which extends the term of the agreement for an additional years until december  
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  key factors affecting operating results annual inflation linked increases in contract capacity rates  resulting in higher capacity revenue  cooler average temperatures resulting in decreased cooling consumption revenue and overall electricity costs due to lower ton hour sales  and higher borrowings associated with the refinanced debt facility established in september  resulting in increased interest expense

line 
gif 
cars out refers to the total number of customers exiting during the period 
average overnight occupancy refers to the aggregate average daily occupancy measured for all locations at the lowest point of the day and does not reflect turnover and intra day activity 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  key factors affecting operating results higher revenue due to the addition of one new parking location that commenced operation in november and the sublease of a property previously used for overflow  increased operating costs associated with improving customer service and additional costs incurred from one new location  and higher selling  general and administrative costs associated with the consolidation of our locations under one brand 
liquidity and capital resources our principal cash requirements include normal operating expenses  debt service  maintenance capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to shareholders 
our primary means of meeting these requirements is from cash generated by operating activities  although we could borrow against existing credit facilities or issue additional llc interests 
in general  we have not retained significant cash balances in excess of what are prudent reserves in either our operating companies or our holding company 
however  the current dislocation in the capital markets has caused us to retain cash that historically we would have distributed to shareholders  and we have therefore suspended our quarterly cash distributions 
the additional cash is expected to buffer the company against continued deterioration in the credit markets in particular and  therefore  may be used by us to pay down holding company debt or outstanding debt of existing businesses that we believe have long term value  particularly our airport services business 
as previously discussed  there is substantial doubt about our parking business ability to continue as a going concern and we have no intention of contributing any additional capital to this business 
creditors of this business do not have recourse to any assets of the company or any assets of our other businesses  other than approximately million in guarantees 
with the exception of the liquidity needs of our airport parking business  we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our future requirements  including our holding company and subsidiary debt obligations 
we base our assessment of the sufficiency of our liquidity and capital resources on the following assumptions our businesses and investments overall generate  and will continue to generate  significant operating cash flow  the ongoing maintenance capital expenditures associated with our businesses are modest and readily funded from their respective operating cash flow or available financing  all significant short term growth capital expenditures will be funded with cash on hand or from committed undrawn debt facilities  and we will be able to refinance or extend maturing debt on terms that can be supported by the performance of the relevant business 
on february   we amended our airport services business credit facility to reduce the principal amount due under that facility and provide us additional operating flexibility over the near and medium term 
we used million in cash on hand to pay down million of the outstanding term loan debt under the facility and million of interest rate swap break fees  of which million was paid to macquarie bank limited  a related company 
additionally  we have agreed to apply all excess cash flow from the airport services business to make mandatory prepayments of the term loans under facility whenever the debt level is equal to or more than x adjusted ebitda for the trailing twelve months 
we have also agreed to apply half the excess cash flow to make further prepayments whenever the debt level is equal to or greater than x and below x debt to adjusted ebitda ratio 
all of the excess cash flow from the business would be available for distribution to us whenever the debt level is below x debt to adjusted ebitda ratio 
additionally  the maximum permitted debt to adjusted ebitda ratio would be increased by x over the 
table of contents current maximum ratio until december in order to achieve the required adjusted ebitda ratio  we have also cut selling  general and administrative costs in this business by approximately million on an annual basis 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses reductions stem from cost efficiencies resulting from integration of recently acquired businesses and management s actions to streamline our cost structure in response to the decline in gross profit from the overall slowing of the economy 
we have amended the restricted payment test on this facility to substitute the minimum adjusted ebitda test required to make distributions with a leverage test debt to adjusted ebitda 
we have also increased the maximum leverage covenant until the final year of the facility  and amended a pre approved list of capital expenditures for which borrowings remain available under the capital expenditures facility 
the section below discusses the sources and uses of cash on a consolidated basis and for each of our businesses and investments 
all inter company activities such as corporate allocation  capital contributions to our businesses and distributions from our businesses have been excluded from the tables below as these transactions are eliminated on consolidation 
prior period comparatives have been updated to also remove these inter company activities 
commitments and contingencies the following tables summarize our future obligations  due by period  as of december   under our various contractual obligations and commitments 
we had no off balance sheet arrangement at that date or currently

the long term debt represents the consolidated principal obligation to various lenders 
the debt facilities  which are obligations of the operating businesses and have maturities between and  are subject to certain covenants  the violation of which could result in acceleration of the maturity date 
the million in the less than one year period relates entirely to debt of our airport parking business  due on or before september  this debt is secured by assets and collateral of our airport parking business 
creditors of this business do not have recourse to any assets of the company or any assets of our other businesses other than approximately million in guarantees and interest rate swap liabilities 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources in part ii  item for further discussions on airport parking business debt facilities due for repayment 
capital lease obligations are for the lease of certain transportation equipment 
such equipment could be subject to repossession upon violation of the terms of the lease agreements 
this represents the minimum annual rentals required to be paid under non cancelable operating leases with terms in excess of one year 
tgc currently has a time charter arrangement for the use of two barges for transporting liquefied petroleum gas between oahu and its neighbor islands 
the above table does not reflect certain long term obligations  such as deferred taxes  for which we are unable to estimate the period in which the obligation will be incurred 

table of contents in addition to these commitments and contingencies  we typically incur capital expenditures on a regular basis to maintain our existing revenue producing assets in good working order maintenance capital expenditures  and expand our existing revenue producing assets or acquire new ones growth capital expenditures 
see investing activities below for further discussion of capital expenditures 
we also have other contingencies  including pending threatened legal and administrative proceedings that are not reflected above as amounts at this time are not ascertainable 
see legal proceedings in part i  item our sources of cash to meet these obligations are as follows cash generated from our operations see operating activities below  refinancing our current credit facilities on or before maturity see financing activities below  and cash available from our undrawn credit facilities see financing activities below 
in addition to these obligations  we have historically paid regular cash distributions to our shareholders  and expect to resume doing so in the future once the capital markets are functioning in a historically normal manner or once we believe we have acceptable level of insight into when they will be functioning normally 
we also incur performance fees from time to time paid to our manager 
our manager has historically elected to reinvest these fees in our llc interests previously trust stock 
while these fees do not directly affect cash flows when paid in equity  they do increase the cash necessary to maintain and increase our distributions to shareholders  as they result in more outstanding llc interests 
we believe this increased cash requirement is mitigated by a lower cost of equity capital as the performance fees are earned only when our llc interests outperform benchmark indices

year ended december  change from to favorable unfavorable change from to favorable unfavorable in thousands cash provided by operating activities   cash used in investing activities   cash provided by financing activities  operating activities consolidated cash provided by operating activities mainly comprises the cash from operations of the businesses we own  as described in each of the business discussions below 
the cash flow from our consolidated business operations is partially offset by expenses paid at the corporate level  such as base management fees paid in cash  professional fees and interest on any amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility 
the decrease in consolidated cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to a million decrease in working capital balances in  compared to a million decrease in  and increased interest expense due to higher levels of debt  partially offset by improved ebitda  as discussed in results of operations  net of the following non cash charges in  that did not recur in 
table of contents million performance fees paid in stock  and million charges associated with the retirement of debt at our airport services and district energy businesses 
we believe our operating activities overall provide a source of sustainable and stable cash flows over the long term with the opportunity for future growth due to consistent customer demand driven by the basic everyday nature of the services provided  our strong competitive position due to factors including high initial development and construction costs  difficulty in obtaining suitable land near many of our operations for example  airports  waterfront near ports  long term concessions contracts  required government approvals  which may be difficult or time consuming to obtain  lack of cost efficient alternatives to the services we provide in the foreseeable future  and product service pricing that we expect to generally keep pace with price changes due to factors including consistent demand  limited alternatives  contractual terms  and regulatory rate setting 
consolidated cash provided by operating activities comprises the cash from operations of the businesses we own as described below 
the cash flow from our consolidated business operations is partially offset by expenses paid at the corporate level  such as base management fees  professional fees and interest on any amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility 
investing activities the decrease in the cash used in investing activities was primarily due to lower cost of acquisitions completed in seven bar and various airport parking facilities compared with supermarine  mercury  san jose and rifle  partially offset by cash proceeds from the sale of two small  non core businesses at our airport services business  and receipt of approximately million as sale proceeds in january from the disposition of our interest in macquarie yorkshire limited in december distributions from imtt are reflected in our consolidated cash provided by operating activities only up to our share of imtt s positive earnings 
amounts in excess of this  and any distributions when imtt records a net loss  are reflected in our consolidated cash from investing activities 
the primary driver of cash used in investing activities in our consolidated cash flows has been acquisitions of businesses in new and existing segments and the dispositions of our non us businesses 
the other main driver is capital expenditures 
maintenance capital expenditures are generally funded by cash from operating activities and growth capital expenditures are generally funded by drawing on our available credit facilities or by equity capital 
we may fund maintenance capital expenditures from credit facilities or equity capital and growth capital expenditures from operating activities from time to time 
we expect that our growth capital expenditures will generally be yield accretive once placed in service 
acquisitions of businesses are generally funded on a long term basis through raising additional equity capital and or project financing style credit facilities 
we have drawn on our mic inc revolving credit facility to temporarily fund some acquisitions 
we anticipate repaying the current outstanding balance from cash provided by operating 
table of contents activities 
in the past  we have repaid this facility with proceeds from raising additional equity and or obtaining long term project financing style facilities 
financing activities the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to proceeds from our equity raise in of million  net of offering costs  and higher debt drawdowns in  primarily by our airport services business to partially finance the fbo acquisitions and by our district energy business  from the refinancing of its existing debt 
the primary drivers of cash provided by financing activities are equity offerings  debt financing of acquisitions and the subsequent refinancing of our businesses 
a smaller portion of cash provided by financing activities relates to principal payments on capital leases and principal payments on the relatively small amount of our non amortizing debt 
we do not expect significant changes in cash provided by financing activities during unless conditions in the capital markets improve 
the primary transactions contributing to our consolidated investing and financing cash flows include the acquisition of additional fbos and parking lots  and draws against existing debt facilities to fund these acquisitions 
the acquisition of additional fbos  proceeds from issuance of equity and debt to finance these acquisitions  refinancing of debt in our airport services and district energy businesses  and sale of our investment in an offshore toll road concession in  for which we received the proceeds in acquisitions of our share of the bulk liquid storage terminal business  our investment in the gas production and distribution business  and additional fbos  proceeds from issuance of equity and debt to finance the above acquisitions  refinancing of debt at our airport parking business  and sale of our investments in mcg and sew 
our businesses are capitalized with a mix of equity and project financing style long term debt 
we believe we can prudently maintain relatively high levels of leverage due to the generally sustainable and stable long term cash flows our businesses have provided in the past and we expect to continue in the future as discussed above 
our long term debt is primarily non amortizing and we consider this to be permanent in nature 
most of our businesses debt is term debt  while some of our businesses also maintain capital expenditure and or working capital facilities 
we generally determine what we believe to be the optimal capital structure for a business as part of our acquisition process 
we implement that structure at acquisition by acquiring an appropriate amount of debt at the subsidiary level and contributing equity from proceeds of an equity offering and or cash on hand from previous offerings 
we maintain a revolving credit facility at the mic inc level to facilitate the acquisition process when we need temporary financing until we complete an equity offering and or debt financing at the subsidiary level 
we continue to actively assess and manage the capital structure of our businesses after acquisition  resulting in refinancing recurring typically every several years or more often 

table of contents mic inc revolving credit facility on february   we renewed our existing million revolving credit facility 
the renewed facility is provided by the following lenders citicorp north america inc as lender and administrative agent  wachovia bank national association  credit suisse  cayman islands branch  westlb ag  new york branch  and macquarie bank limited 
we have used the revolving facility to fund acquisitions  capital expenditures and to a limited extent  working capital 
on february   we drew million on this facility  part of which we used to fund the acquisition of seven bar fbos which was completed in the first quarter of  and part of which we used for other projects 
on july   we drew an additional million on this facility to fund the acquisition of skypark  which was completed in the third quarter of macquarie bank limited  a related party  committed million to the million facility  of which million was drawn on february  as part of the million total drawdown and million was drawn on july  as part of the million drawdown 
the balance outstanding at december  was million 
the borrower under the facility is mic inc  a direct subsidiary of the company  and the obligations under the facility are guaranteed by the company and secured by a pledge of the equity of all current and future direct subsidiaries of mic inc and the company 
the terms and conditions for the revolving facility include events of default  representations and warranties and covenants that are generally customary for a facility of this type 
in addition  the revolving facility includes a restriction on cross guarantees and an event of default should the manager or another member of the macquarie group cease to manage our business and operations

we provided our airport services business with million of funding in which was used to pay for the acquisition of seven bar fbos reflected above in cash used in investing activities and to pre fund integration costs 
we also provided million in which was used to pay for the acquisitions of supermarine  mercury  san jose and rifle fbos and to pre fund integration costs  and million to fund growth capital expenditures both of which are also reflected above in cash used in investing activities 
these contributions from us are not reflected in cash provided by financing activities above  as they are eliminated on consolidation 
in response to the slowing of the overall economy and the recent decline in general aviation activity  we have undertaken to reduce the indebtedness of our airport services and provide for greater cushion with respect to debt covenants 
in cooperation with our lenders  we amended the terms of the loan agreement of our airport services business 
the amendment was executed on february  the revised terms are outlined under financing activities below 
operating activities operating cash at our airport services business is generated from sales transactions primarily paid by credit cards 
some customers are extended payment terms and billed accordingly 
cash is used in operating activities mainly for payments to vendors of fuel  aircraft services and professional services  as well as payroll costs and payments to tax jurisdictions 
despite the contribution to our operating results from sites acquired  cash provided by operating activities decreased mainly due to declining performance at existing locations  higher interest expense related to acquisition funding and the timing of fuel payments  including a one off change to payment terms from suppliers in investing activities cash used in investing activities relates primarily to our acquisitions and capital expenditures 
cash paid for our acquisition of seven bar fbos in the first quarter of  net of cash acquired  was million 
we funded the acquisition with borrowings under our mic inc revolving credit facility that we contributed to the business 
this compares to a purchase price of million  net of cash acquired  for the acquisitions of supermarine  mercury  san jose and rifle in  of which we funded million in new debt at the business level and the remainder through contributions by us to the business 
maintenance expenditures are generally funded by cash from operating activities and growth capital expenditures are generally funded with draw downs on capital expenditure facilities or equity contributions from us 
maintenance capital expenditure maintenance capital expenditures encompass repainting  replacing equipment as necessary and any ongoing environmental or required regulatory expenditure  such as installing safety equipment 
these expenditures are funded from cash flow from operating activities 
growth capital expenditure growth capital expenditures are incurred primarily in connection with lease extensions and only where we expect to receive an appropriate return relative to our cost of capital 
historically these expenditures have 
table of contents included development of hangars  terminal buildings and ramp upgrades 
we have funded these projects through our growth capital expenditure facilities

maintenance growth million million million million million million projected million million commitments at december    the increased growth capital expenditures in primarily relates to projects associated with the mercury acquisition  the construction of a new hangar at the san jose fbo and a ramp repair and extension at our teterboro location 
we expect growth capital expenditures to be million in and million in the expected decrease in growth capital expenditures reflects the completion of all major projects undertaken last year as well as obligations under our various fbo lease agreements 
the increases in maintenance capital expenditures are primarily due to an increased number of locations arising from our acquisitions 
we generally expect annual maintenance capital expenditures to average between  and  per location to provide necessary upgrades and refurbishment of our facilities as well as additions to and replacement of our ground support equipment fleet 
financing activities the decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to the additional debt associated with the purchase of supermarine  mercury and san jose in and the refinancing of debt in october the financial covenant requirements under the airport services business debt and credit facilities  and the calculation of these measures at quarter end  were as follows debt service coverage ratio x or x for cash lock up at december  x leverage ratio x at december  x minimum adjusted ebitda as defined in the debt facility million at december  million the terms of the loan agreement of our airport services business have been revised in accordance with the amendment completed and effective on february  a comparative summary of key terms is presented below

we account for our ownership of this business using the equity method  so distributions are reflected in our consolidated cash flow from operating activities only up to our share of imtt s positive earnings 
when imtt records a net loss  or pays distributions in excess of our share of its earnings  distributions we receive in excess of imtt s earnings are reflected in the consolidated cash flow from investing activities 
we have received a quarterly dividend of million since completing our investment in may for the year ended december   million was included in our consolidated cash from operating activities and million was included in our consolidated cash from investing activities 
for the year ended december   million was included in consolidated cash from investing activities 
beginning first quarter of  the imtt shareholders agreement prescribes that distributions to be paid by imtt will convert from a fixed amount to a variable amount generally based on imtt s cash flow from operating activities less maintenance and environmental capital expenditures 
however  we may agree to reduce the level of distributions actually paid by imtt during and beyond below the amount prescribed 
table of contents by the shareholders agreement after consideration of  among other factors  the outlook for bulk liquid storage market conditions  the level of imtt s indebtedness and the availability of external sources of funding for growth capital projects 
in particular  as discussed further below  in imtt intends to seek to raise additional debt financing to fund its growth capital expenditure program and scheduled debt amortizations during and in the event that sufficient additional debt financing is not able to be raised  imtt will need to fund all or part of its existing growth capital expenditure program and scheduled debt amortizations during and from cash flow from operating activities resulting in a potentially significant reduction in the level of distributions to be paid by imtt in and based on current market conditions and assuming completion during of some of the expansion projects currently under construction  it is anticipated that imtt s gross profit and ebitda will increase to ranges of million to million and million to million  respectively  in increased maintenance and environmental capital expenditure and capitalized dredging expenditure in is anticipated to reduce imtt s cash available for distribution in to a range of million to million 
imtt anticipates that gross profit  ebitda and cash available for distribution will increase from in due to the positive impact of a full year contribution from growth projects coming on line part way through and a contribution from growth projects coming on line in

we have requested an extension on this debt  are in discussion with the lender and anticipate that we will secure it 
an additional million of outstanding debt is also scheduled to mature on may  the million credit facility matures on september  and we believe it is unlikely  absent a significant improvement in credit markets and improvement in the business operations or substantial concessions from lenders  that we will be able to refinance or repay this indebtedness prior to its maturity and we have classified all of this debt as current  due to uncertainty regarding the business ability to extend or refinance the facilities 
in addition  the business is currently in default under the liquidity covenant in this facility and  based on the preliminary results for the first quarter of  it is unlikely that the business will be in compliance with its other financial covenants as of march  in the event we are unable to obtain waivers  or are unable to restructure this indebtedness  the lenders may pursue certain remedies  including seeking to foreclose on collateral 
in such event  we may be required to seek bankruptcy protection for the business or liquidate the business 
we are in discussions with our lenders as discussed above but these discussions may not result in an acceptable solution 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different conditions 
our critical accounting estimates and policies are discussed below 
these estimates and policies are consistent with the estimates and accounting policies followed by the businesses we own 
business combinations our acquisitions of businesses that we control are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder  if any  recorded as goodwill 
the fair values are determined by our management  taking into consideration information supplied by the management of acquired entities and other relevant information 
such information includes valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts for significant business combinations 
the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
the determination of fair values require significant judgment both by management and outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
goodwill  intangible assets and property  plant and equipment significant assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of the airport services business  gas production and distribution business  district energy business and airport parking business include contract rights  customer relationships  non compete agreements  trademarks  domain names  property and equipment and goodwill 
trademarks and domain names are generally considered to be indefinite life intangibles 
trademarks  domain names and goodwill are not amortized in most circumstances 
it may be appropriate to amortize some 
table of contents trademarks and domain names 
however  for unamortized intangible assets  we are required to perform annual impairment reviews and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which included the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
the airport services business  gas production and distribution business  district energy business and airport parking business are separate reporting units for purposes of this analysis 
the impairment test for trademarks and domain names which are not amortized requires the determination of the fair value of such assets 
if the fair value of the trademarks and domain names is less than their carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and or intangible assets 
such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or material negative change in relationship with significant customers 
property and equipment is initially stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
our estimated useful lives represent the period the asset remains in service assuming normal routine maintenance 
we review the estimated useful lives assigned to property and equipment when our business experience suggests that they do not properly reflect the consumption of economic benefits embodied in the property and equipment nor result in the appropriate matching of cost against revenue 
factors that lead to such a conclusion may include physical observation of asset usage  examination of realized gains and losses on asset disposals and consideration of market trends such as technological obsolescence or change in market demand 
significant intangibles  including contract rights  customer relationships  non compete agreements and technology are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible asset after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
with respect to contract rights in our airport services business  we take into consideration the history of contract right renewals in determining our assessment of useful life and the corresponding amortization period 
we perform impairment reviews of property and equipment and intangibles subject to amortization  when events or circumstances indicate that assets are less than their carrying amount and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
in this circumstance  the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount of the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
any impairment is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of reporting units and fair value of property and equipment and intangible assets is determined by our management and is generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value

hedging with respect to our debt facilities  and the expected cash flows from our previously held non us investments  we entered into a series of interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives to provide an economic hedge of our interest rate and foreign exchange exposure 
we originally classified each hedge as a cash flow hedge at inception for accounting purposes 
as discussed in note  derivative instruments and hedging activities  in our consolidated financial statements  in we determined that none of our derivative instruments qualified for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  as amended  requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values and  for derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting  that changes in the fair value of the derivative be recognized in earnings 
the determination of fair value of these instruments involves estimates and assumptions and actual value may differ from the fair value reflected in the financial statements 
we commenced hedge accounting in january and have classified each interest rate derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge from this time 
changes in the value of the hedges  to the extent effective  will be recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
changes in the value that represent the ineffective portion of the hedge will be recorded in earnings as a gain or loss 
we did not have any foreign exchange derivatives at december  income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled
