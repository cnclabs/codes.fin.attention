overview in  the company continued its balance sheet conversion to a more commercial profile and improved its profitability 
the company increased its commercial loan and lease portfolio by nearly 
net interest income and diluted earnings per common share improved in  while the company slightly reduced its operating costs 
for a fuller narrative commentary on these matters  refer to item  business 
the primary drivers of the company s operating income are net interest income  which is strongly affected by the net yield on interest earning assets net interest margin  and the quality of the company s assets 
the company s net interest income represents the difference between its interest income and its cost of funds 
interest income depends on the amount of interest earning assets outstanding during the year and the interest rates earned thereon 
cost of funds is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the year and the interest rates paid thereon 
net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin generally exceeds the net interest spread as a portion of interest earning assets are funded by various noninterest bearing sources primarily noninterest bearing deposits and shareholders equity 
the increases decreases in the components of interest income and interest expense  expressed in terms of fluctuation in average volume and rate  are summarized in the rate volume analysis table show n on page information as to the components of interest income and interest expense and average rates is provided under average balances  yields and costs on page because the company s assets are not identical in duration and in repricing dates to its liabilities  the spread between the two is vulnerable to changes in market interest rates as well as the overall shape of the yield curve 
these vulnerabilities are inherent to the business of banking and are commonly referred to as interest rate risk 
how to measure interest rate risk and  once measured  how much risk to take are based on numerous assumptions and other subjective judgments 
see discussion under asset and liability management 
the quality of the company s assets also influences its earnings 
loans and leases that are not being paid on a timely basis and exhibit other weaknesses can result in the loss of principal and or loss of interest income 
additionally  the company must make timely provisions to its allowance for loan and lease losses based on estimates of probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio  these additions  which are charged against earnings  are necessarily greater when greater probable losses are expected 
further  the company will incur expenses as a result of resolving troubled assets 
all of these form the credit risk that the company takes on in the ordinary course of its business and is further discussed under financial condition asset quality 
the company s business strategy has been to concentrate its asset generation efforts on commercial and consumer loans and its deposit generation efforts on checking and savings accounts 
these deposit accounts are commonly referred to as core deposit accounts 
this strategy is based on the company s belief that it can distinguish itself from its larger competitors  and indeed attract customers from them  through a higher level of service and through its ability to set policies and procedures  as well as make decisions  locally 
the loan and deposit products referenced also tend to be geared more toward customers who are relationship oriented than those who are seeking stand alone or single transaction products 
the company believes that its service oriented approach enables it to compete successfully for relationship oriented customers 
additionally  the company is predominantly an urban franchise with a high concentration of busines ses making deployment of funds in the commercial lending area practicable 
commercial loans are attractive  among other reasons  because of their higher yields 
similarly  core deposits are attractive because of their generally lower interest cost and potential for fee income 
the deposit market in rhode island is highly concentrated 
the state s three largest banks have an aggregate market share of based upon june fdic statistics  excluding one bank that draws its deposits primarily from the internet in providence and kent counties  the bank s primary marketplace 
competition for loans and deposits remains intense 
this competition has resulted in considerable advertising and promotional product offerings by competitors  including print  radio and television media 
the company also seeks to leverage business opportunities presented by its customer base  franchise footprint and resources 
in  the bank formed a private banking division and completed the acquisition of an equipment leasing company located in long island  new york macrolease 
the bank is using the macrolease platform to generate additional income by originating equipment leases for third parties  as well as increasing the bank s portfolio of equipment leases 
in  approximately of the company s total revenues defined as net interest income plus noninterest income were derived from its net interest income 
in a continuing effort to diversify its sources of revenue  the company has sought to expand its sources of noninterest income primarily fees and charges for products and services the bank offers 
service charges on deposit accounts remain the largest component of noninterest income 
in  the bank experienced an overall increase in net interest margin  as the net interest margin of was basis points bps higher than the net interest margin of 
the future operating results of the company will depend on the ability to maintain net interest margin  while minimizing exposure to credit risk  along with increasing sources of noninterest income  while controlling the growth of noninterest or operating expenses 
critical accounting policies accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management  which have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or net income  are considered critical accounting policies 
the company considers the following to be its critical accounting policies allowance for loan and lease losses  review of goodwill for impairment  valuation of investment and mortgage backed securities and income taxes 
there have been no significant changes in the methods or assumptions used in accounting policies that require material estimates or assumptions 
allowance for loan and lease losses arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan and lease losses necessarily involves a significant degree of judgment 
first and foremost in arriving at an appropriate allowance is the creation and maintenance of a risk rating system that accurately classifies all loans  leases and commitments into varying categories by degree of credit risk 
such a system also establishes a level of allowance associated with each category of loans and requires early identification and reclassification of deteriorating credits 
besides numerous subjective judgments as to the number of categories  appropriate level of allowance with respect to each category and judgments as to categorization of any individual loan or lease  additional subjective judgments are involved when ascertaining the probability as well as the extent of any probable losses 
the company s ongoing evaluation process includes a formal analysis of the allowance each quarter  which considers  among other factors  the character and size of the loan and lease portfolio  business and economic conditions  loan growth  delinquency trends  nonperforming loan trends  charge off experience and other asset quality factors 
these factors are based on observable information  as well as subjective assessment and interpretation 
nonperforming commercial  commercial real estate and small business loans and leases in excess of a specified dollar amount are deemed to be impaired 
the estimated reserves necessary for each of these credits is determined by reviewing the fair value of the collateral if collateral dependent  the present value of expected future cash flows  or where available  the observable market price of the loans 
provisions for losses on the remaining commercial  commercial real estate  small business  residential mortgage and consumer loans and leases are based on pools of similar loans or leases using a combination of payment status  historical loss experience  industry loss experience  market economic factors  delinquency rates and qualitative adjustments 
while management evaluates currently available information in establishing the allowance for loan and lease losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making evaluations 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review a financial institution s allowance for loan and lease losses and carrying amounts of other real estate owned 
such agencies may require the financial institution to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
review of goodwill for impairment in march  the bank acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from fleet financial group  inc and related entities 
this acquisition was accounted for utilizing the purchase method of accounting and generated million of goodwill 
this goodwill was amortized in the years prior to  resulting in a net balance of million on the company s balance sheet as of december  effective january   in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions  the company ceased amortizing this goodwill and currently reviews it at least annually for impairment 
on may   the bank acquired certain operating assets from macrolease international corporation 
this acquisition was accounted for utilizing the purchase method of accounting and has generated million of goodwill through december  the company evaluates goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the company to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the company exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not deemed to be impaired 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  a further analysis is required to determine the amount of impairment  if any 
the fair value of the company was determined using market value comparisons for similar institutions  such as price to earnings multiples  price to book value multiples and price to tangible book value multiples 
this valuation technique utilizes verifiable market multiples  as well as subjective assessment and interpretation 
the application of different market multiples  or changes in judgment as to which market transactions are reflective of the company s specific characteristics  could affect the conclusions reached regarding possible impairment 
in the event that the company was to determine that its goodwill was impaired  the recognition of an impairment charge could have an adverse impact on its results of operations in the period that the impairment occurred or on its financial position 
valuation of investments and mortgage backed securities debt securities can be classified as trading  available for sale or held to maturity 
securities are classified as trading and carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings  if they are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term 
debt securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost only if the company has the positive intent and the ability to hold these securities to maturity 
securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of estimated income taxes 
as of december  and  all of the company s investment and mortgage backed securities were classified as available for sale 
declines in the fair values of securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings in the period that management concludes that other than temporary impairment occurs 
the company uses various indicators in determining whether a security is other than temporarily impaired  including for debt securities  when it is probable that the contractual interest and principal will not be collected  the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than cost and the creditworthiness and near term prospects of the issuer 
management also considers capital adequacy  interest rate risk  liquidity and business plans in assessing the intent and ability of the company to retain the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
continued adverse economic and market conditions could result in losses from other than temporary impairment 
income taxes certain areas of accounting for income taxes require management s judgment  including determining the expected realization of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
judgments are made regarding various tax positions  which are often subjective and involve assumptions about items that are inherently uncertain 
if actual factors and conditions differ materially from estimates made by management  the actual realization of the net deferred tax assets or liabilities for uncertain tax positions could vary materially from the amounts previously recorded 
deferred tax assets arise from items that may be used as a tax deduction or credit in future income tax returns  for which a financial statement tax benefit has already been recognized 
the realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable income and the existence of prior years taxable income to which refund claims could be carried back 
valuation allowances are recorded against those deferred tax assets determined not likely to be realized 
deferred tax liabilities represent items that will require a future tax payment 
they generally represent tax expense recognized in the company s financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or a deduction taken on the company s tax return but not yet recognized as an expense in the company s financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities are also recognized for certain non cash items such as goodwill

consumer loans during  consumer loan outstandings decreased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  the decline in growth was reflective of the softening of housing prices in the local market area over the past months 
the company believes the softening prices have reduced consumer appetite for borrowing against the value of their homes 
however  the company continues to promote consumer lending as it believes that these ten to twenty year fixed rate products  along with the floating lines of credit  still possess attractive cash flow characteristics in the current interest rate environment

oreo consists of real estate acquired through foreclosure proceedings and real estate acquired through acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
nonperforming loans are defined as nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more but still accruing and impaired loans 
under certain circumstances  the company may restructure the terms of a loan as a concession to a borrower 
these restructured loans are generally considered impaired loans 
there were million of impaired loans included in nonaccrual loans at december   compared to million of impaired loans at december  there were no impaired loans at december  nonperforming assets at december   the company had nonperforming assets of million  or  of total assets 
this compares to nonperforming assets of million  or of total assets  at december   and nonperforming assets of million  or of total assets  at december  nonperforming assets at december  consisted of commercial loans and leases aggregating million  residential loans aggregating million  commercial loans and leases days past due  but still accruing of  and other real estate owned of  nonperforming assets at december  and were primarily comprised of nonaccrual commercial loans and nonaccrual residential loans 
the company evaluates the underlying collateral of each nonperforming asset and continues to pursue the collection of interest and principal 
management believes that the december  level o f nonperforming assets is low relative to the size of the company s loan portfolio and as compared to peer institutions 
the weak economy has resulted in an increase in charge offs and nonperforming assets in if current economic conditions continue or worsen  management believes that the level of nonperforming will increase  as will its level of charged off loans 
the following table sets forth information regarding nonperforming assets

additionally  when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period income 
loans are removed from nonaccrual when concern no longer exists as to the collectibility of principal or interest  typically when payment has been received timely for six months 
interest collected on nonaccruing loans is either applied against principal or reported as income according to management s judgment as to the collectibility of principal 
at december   nonaccrual loans totaled million

this compares to million and million of loans to days past due as of december  and  respectively 
the majority of these loans at december  were commercial loans and leases and residential loans  while nonaccrual loans at december  and were primarily commercial loans and leases 
within loans past due to days at december  were million of commercial leases to government entities  which were primarily attributable to administrative delays as opposed to underlying credit or cash flow issues 
this amount compares to million of government leases past due to days at december  and  at december  management reviews delinquent loans frequently to assess problem situations and to address these problems quickly 
in the case of consumer and commercial loans  the bank contacts the borrower when a loan becomes delinquent 
when a payment is not made  generally within days of the due date  a late charge is assessed 
after days of delinquency  a notice is sent to the borrower advising that failure to cure the default may result in formal demand for payment in full 
in the event of further delinquency  the matter is generally referred to legal counsel to commence civil proceedings to collect all amounts owed 
in the case of residential mortgage loans  delinquency and collection proceedings are conducted by either the bank  or its mortgage servicers  in accordance with standard servicing guidelines 
in any circumstance where the bank is secured by real property or other collateral  the bank enforces its rights to the collateral in accordance with ap plicable law

an asset is considered substandard if inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if existing deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncoll ectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
at december   the company had million of assets that were classified as substandard 
this compares to million and million of assets that were classified as substandard at december  and  respectively 
the company had no assets that were classified as loss or doubtful at any of these dates 
performing loans may or may not be adversely classified depending upon management s judgment with respect to each individual loan 
at december   included in the million of assets that were classified as substandard  were million of performing loans 
this compares to million and million of adversely classified performing assets at december  and  respectively 
these amounts constitute assets that  in the opinion of management  could potentially migrate to nonperforming or doubtful status 
if the current weak economic or market conditions con tinue or worsen  management believes it is likely that the level of adversely classified assets would increase 
this in turn may necessitate an increase to the provision for loan and lease losses in future periods 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses has been established for credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio through a charge to earnings 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained at a level management considers appropriate to provide for the current inherent risk of loss based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan and lease portfolio 
loans deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are added to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
amounts are charged off once the probability of loss has been established  with consideration given to such factors as the customer s financial condition  underlying collateral and guarantees  and general and industry economic conditions 
when an insured institution classifies problem loans as either substandard or doubtful  it is required to establish allowances for loan and lease losses in an amount deemed prudent by management 
additionally  general loss allowances are established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities  and have not been allocated to particular problem loans and leases 
the following table represents the allocation of the allowance for loan and leases losses as of the dates indicated december  amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans dollars in thousands commercial loans and leases residential mortgage loans consumer and other loans unallocated na na na na na total assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan and leases losses involves substantial uncertainties and is based upon management s evaluation of the amounts required to meet estimated charge offs in the loan and lease portfolio after weighing various factors 
management s methodology to estimate loss exposure includes an analysis of individual loans and leases deemed to be impaired  reserve allocations for various loan types based on payment status or loss experience and an unallocated allowance that is maintained based on management s assessment of many factors including the growth  composition and quality of the loan and lease portfolio  historical loss experiences  general economic conditions and other pertinent factors 
these risk factors are continuously reviewed and revised by management where conditions indicate that the estimates initially applied are different from actual results 
if credit performance is worse than antici pated  the company could incur additional loan and lease losses in future periods 
a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses is not allocated to any specific segment of the loan and lease portfolio 
this non specific allowance is maintained for two primary reasons i there exists an inherent subjectivity and imprecision to the analytical processes employed  and ii the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
management  therefore  has established and maintains a non specific allowance for loan and lease losses 
the amount of this measurement imprecision allocation was million at december   compared to million at december  with respect to changes within the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses  allocations at december  reflect both changes in loan and lease balances as well as reassessment of risks within the various loan and lease categ ories 
while management evaluates currently available information in establishing the allowance for loan and lease losses  future adjustments to the allowance for loan and lease losses may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations 
management performs a comprehensive review of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a quarterly basis 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review a financial institution s allowance for loan and lease losses and carrying amounts of other real estate owned 
such agencies may require the financial institution to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the factors supporting the allowance for loan and lease losses do not diminish the fact that the entire allowance for loan and lease losses is available to absorb losses in the entire loan and lease portfolio 
the company s primary concern is the appropriateness of the total allowance for loan and lease losses 
based on the evaluation described above  management believes that the year end allowance for loan and lease losses is appropriate 
during  and  the bank made additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses of million   and million and experienced net charge offs of million   and  respectively 
at december   the allowance for loan and leases losses stood at million and represented of nonperforming loans and leases and of total loans outstanding 
this compares to an allowance for loan and lease losses of million  representing of nonperforming loans and leases and of total loans and leases outstanding at december  an analysis of the activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses is as follows year ended december  in thousands allowance for loan and lease losses balance at beginning of year loans charged off commercial loans and leases residential mortgage loans consumer and other loans total loans charged off recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial loans and leases residential mortgage loans consumer and other loans total recoveries of loans previously charged off net charge offs provision for loan losses charged against income balance at end of year net charge offs to average loans outstanding investments total investments consisting of overnight investments  investment securities  mbss  and fhlb stock totaled million  or of total assets  at december  this compares to total investments of million  or of total assets  as of december  the decrease of million  or  was centered in decreases of investment securities of million and overnight investments of million 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in mortgage backed securities of million 
all investment securities and mbss at december  and were classified as securities available for sale 
at december   the investment portfolio carried a total net unrealized gain of  compared to  of net unrealized loss at december  the primary driver of the increase in net unrealized gains is attributable to the yields on fixed rate mbss as compared to the market rate s on similar securities at december   partially offset by declines in the fair value of other investment securities 
the investment portfolio provides the company a source of short term liquidity and acts as a counterbalance to loan and deposit flows

if the company determines that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  an impairment write down is recognized in current earnings 
in making these other than temporary determinations  management considers  among other facts  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and the creditworthiness and near term prospects of the issuer 
management also considers capital adequacy  interest rate risk  liquidity and business plans in assessing the intent and ability to hold all securities with unrealized losses until recovery or maturity 
if market conditions for securities worsen or the creditworthiness of the underlying issuers deteriorates  it is possible that the company may recognize additional other than temporary impairments in future periods 
the company owns two collateralized debt obligations cdos backed by pools of trust preferred securities 
the total unrealized loss on these securities at december  was million 
during the third quarter of  one of the cdos was determined to have experienced an adverse change in cash flows and to be other than temporarily impaired 
as such  the company recorded a  charge to noninterest income to reflect the fair value of the security of  at september  if market conditions for securities worsen or the creditworthiness of the underlying issuers deteriorates  it is possible that the company may recognize additional other than temporary impairments in future periods 
the company s remaining securities in an unrealized loss position were deemed not to be other than temporarily impaired after considering the aforementioned factors 
in addition  the company has the intent and ability to hold securities with unrealized losses until recovery or maturity and believes it will continue to receive all contractual principal and interest payments

in the first quarter of  the bank decreased the amount of its wholesale repurchase agreements by million 
the bank may utilize wholesale repurchase agreement funding or brokered cds in the future if spreads are favorable compared to fhlb borrowings 
on a long term basis  the company intends to continue concentrating on increasing its core deposits  and will utilize fhlb borrowings  brokered deposits  federal reserve discount window borrowings  or wholesale repurchase agreements as cash flows dictate  as opportunities present themselves and as part of the bank s overall strategy to manage interest rate risk 
subordinated deferrable interest debentures in september  the company redeemed million of subordinated deferrable interest debentures  which were held by bri statutory trust ii 
as of december   the company had million outstanding of subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued to its three statutory trust subsidiaries 
the statutory trust subsidiaries have then participated in the issuance of pooled trust preferred securities 
the regulatory capital generated from issuing the trust preferred securities helped support the company s continued asset growth 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity liquidity is defined as the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
the company further defines liquidity as the ability to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers  as well as to earnings enhancement opportunities  in a changing marketplace 
the primary source of funds for the payment of dividends and expenses by the company is dividends paid to it by the bank 
bank regulatory authorities generally restrict the amounts available for payment of dividends if the effect thereof would cause the capital of the bank to be reduced below applicable capital requirements 
these restrictions indirectly affect the company s ability to pay dividends 
the primary sources of liquidity for the bank consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  borrowed funds  maturing investment securities and sales of securities from the available for sale portfolio 
while management believes that these sources are sufficient to fund the bank s lending and investment activities  the availability of these funding sources are subject to broad economic conditions and could be restricted in the future 
such restrictions would impact the company s immediate liquidity and or additional liquidity 
management is responsible for establishing and monitoring liquidity targets as well as strategies and tactics to meet these targets 
in general  the company maintains a high degree of flexibility with a liquidity target of to of total assets

capital resources total shareholders equity of the company at december  was million  as compared to million at december  this increase of million was primarily attributable to the us treasury s million investment pursuant to the cpp as described below 
the remaining increase in equity of million resulted from net income of million  stock option activity stock option exercises  share based compensation and related tax benefits of million  net unrealized gains on securities increasing  share repurchases of million and common stock dividends paid of million 
additionally  the company had a stock repurchase program authorized by the company s board of directors  which enabled the company to proactively manage its capital position 
the program  which was initially approved on april   authorized the company to repurchase up to  shares of its common stock from time to time through open market or privately negotiated purchases 
on november   the company expanded the stock repurchase program to  shares and also adopted a written purchase plan pursuant to rule b of the exchange act

pursuant to the agreement  the company sold  shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a  having a liquidation preference equal to  per share  with an attached warrant to purchase  shares of company common stock  for the aggregate price of million  to the us treasury 
the series a preferred shares qualify as tier capital and will pay cumulative dividends at a rate of per year  for the first five years  and per year thereafter 
under the terms of the cpp  the series a preferred shares may be redeemed with the approval of the frb in the first three years with the proceeds from the issuance of certain qualifying tier capital or after three years at the liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
the warrant has a year term with vesting immediately upo n issuance and the remaining vesting on january  if certain qualified equity offerings are not satisfied 
the warrant has an exercise price  subject to anti dilution adjustments  equal to per share of common stock 
due to the company s participation in the cpp  the company may not increase its dividend or repurchase shares of its common stock for three years from the date of the agreement without the prior consent of the us treasury unless the series a preferred shares have been redeemed in whole or transferred to a third party which is not an affiliate of the company 
redemption of the series a preferred shares is now permitted under arra without penalty and without the need to raise new capital  subject to the us treasury s consultation with the recipient s appropriate regulatory agency 
all fdic insured institutions must meet specified minimal capital requirements 
these regulations require banks to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio 
at december   the bank s tier i leverage ratio stood at 
in addition  the fdic has adopted capital guidelines based upon ratios of a bank s capital to total assets adjusted for risk 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
these regulations require banks to maintain minimum capital levels for capital adequacy purposes and higher capital levels to be considered well capitalized 
according to these standards  the bank had a tier i risk weighted capital ratio of and a total risk weighted capital ratio of at december  the frb has also issued capital guidelines for bank holding companies 
these guidelines require the company to maintain minimum capital levels for capital adequacy purposes 
in general  the frb has adopted substantially identical capital adequacy guidelines as the fdic 
such standards are applicable to bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries on a consolidated basis

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management the principal objective of the company s asset and liability management process is to maximize profit potential while minimizing the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates by managing the ratio of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities within specified maturity or repricing periods 
the asset and liability management process is dependent on numerous assumptions  many of which require significant judgments by the company 
the company s actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the bank s asset liability committee alco that is comprised of members of senior management 
the alco generally meets monthly and is actively involved in formulating the economic assumptions that the company uses in its financial planning and budgeting process and establishes policies which control and monitor the sources  uses and pricing of funds 
the alco manages the company s interest rate risk position using both income simulation and interest rate sensitivity gap analysis 
income simulation is the primary tool for measuring the interest rate risk inherent in the company s balance sheet at a given point in time by showing the effect on net interest income  over a month period  of interest rate ramps of up to bps 
these simulations take into account repricing  maturity and prepayment characteristics of individual products 
the alco reviews simulation results to determine whether the exposure to income resulting from changes in market interest rates remains within established tolerance levels over a month horizon  and develops appropriate strategies to manage this exposure 
the company s guidelines for interest rate risk specify that if interest rates were to shift up or down bps over a month period  estimated net interest income should decli ne by no more than 
as of december   net interest income simulation indicated that the company s exposure to changing interest rates was within these tolerances 
the alco reviews the methodology utilized for calculating interest rate risk exposure and may periodically adopt modifications to this methodology 
the following table presents the estimated impact of interest rate ramps on estimated net interest income over a month period beginning january  estimated impact on net interest income dollar change percent change dollars in thousands initial twelve month period up basis point ramp down basis point ramp the company also uses interest rate sensitivity gap analysis to provide a more general overview of its interest rate risk profile 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
at december   the company s cumulative one year gap was a positive million  or of total assets  compared to a positive million  or of total assets  at the end of the following table presents the repricing schedule for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  to the extent applicable  amounts of assets and liabilities that mature or reprice within a particular period were determined in accordance with their contractual terms 
investment securities are allocated based upon expected call dates 
loans and mbss have been allocated based upon expected amortization and prepayment rates based on historical performance and market expectations 
savings  now and money market deposit accounts  which have no contractual term and are subject to immediate repricing  are anticipated to behave more like core accounts and therefore are presented as spread evenly over the first three years

as a result  assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may  in fact  reprice at different times and at different rate levels
