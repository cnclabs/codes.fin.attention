item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  other parts of this report and other company filings are forward looking statements 
these statements discuss  among other things  future sales  operating results and financial condition 
forward looking statements reflect the company s current plans and expectations regarding important risk factors and are based on information currently known to the company 
the company cautions readers that any forward looking statements contained in this report or made by the management of the company involve risks and uncertainties  and are subject to change based on various important factors 
such statements may be identified by such words as anticipate  expect  may  believe  could  estimate  project  and similar words or phrases 
the company does not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements 
the factors listed below  among others  could affect the company s financial results and could cause the company s financial performance to differ materially from the expectations expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company changes in economic  political or social conditions our profitability may be impacted by both national and local economic conditions  particularly in southern california 
changes in economic conditions such as recessionary cycles  increased levels of unemployment  higher consumer debt levels  inflation  higher interest rates and tax rates and increased energy costs may result in reduced consumer spending or influence our customers to shift their spending to our lower priced competitors 
the recent turmoil in the economy  including the financial and residential real estate markets  and higher levels of unemployment will continue to influence consumer spending patterns in the future 
in addition  current market conditions may limit the amount that the company can charge for its products 
if the company is unable to pass increased costs on to its customers  profit margins may be negatively affected 
in addition  our business may be subject to interruption from acts of terrorism  national emergencies or natural disasters 
competition in the grocery business the retail grocery business is intensely competitive with respect to price  food quality and selection  service and location 
during the past several years  there has been a consolidation in the supermarket industry 
we are in direct competition with numerous local outlets of regional and national supermarket chains  independent grocery stores  convenience stores  specialty and gourmet markets and food and grocery departments in mass merchandise and club stores 
there are a number of well established competitors with substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than ours  some of which are also nonunion 
we frequently face the opening of a new or remodeled competitor s store in our trade area 
competition also requires us to periodically remodel our existing stores  at ever increasing costs  in order to maintain their appeal 
an inability to successfully compete with other grocery retailers in our trade areas could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and profitability 

table of contents food and drug safety concerns there is increasing governmental scrutiny and public awareness regarding food and drug safety 
the company could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the company s food and drug products 
any events that give rise to actual or potential food contamination  drug contamination or food borne illness could result in product liability claims and a loss of consumer confidence 
in addition  adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether valid or not  may discourage consumers from buying the company s products or cause production and delivery disruptions  which could have an adverse effect on the company s sales and results of operations 
new labor contracts and labor stoppages the majority of our employees belong to unions with which we have signed labor agreements which establish rates of pay  benefits and procedures for the orderly settlement of disputes 
in order to continue to attract and retain quality personnel  we may accept terms that increase our operating costs  which in turn  may negatively impact our profitability 
if contract negotiations are not successful  the union could recommend that our employees vote to strike our stores  distribution center and offices 
in july  the ufcw completed negotiation of a new contract with the three major grocery retailers in our trade area 
the wage increases agreed to by these three competitors were somewhat less than the company agreed to for certain job classifications and experience levels during our ufcw negotiations in february and march this could affect our ability to compete with grocery retailers whose labor costs are less than our own 
cost of providing employee benefits the company provides health insurance for the majority of its nonunion employees 
health care costs have increased significantly in recent years 
if this trend continues  it could have a negative impact on the company s profitability 
in addition  the company contributes to several multi employer union health care plans in accordance with the company s various collective bargaining agreements 
currently  the health and welfare fund which covers the majority of the company s ufcw employees is overfunded 
the contribution rate paid by all employers was reduced effective march originally  the reduction in the health and welfare contribution rate was expected to reduce the overfunded status of the fund over the term of the current agreement which ends on march  however  many factors influence how long the fund will maintain an overfunded status including changes in the cost of health care  the return on investments of funds held by the plan  changes to benefits offered under the plan and government regulations 
the company s health and welfare contribution rate was scheduled to increase effective with hours worked during march  however  the company was recently notified by the southern california united food commercial workers unions and the food employers joint trust funds trust that the increase has been suspended for the six month period beginning march and ending august the trust will review the effective rate again in august 
table of contents the company also participates in various multi employer union pension plans 
adverse stock market developments have significantly impacted the funded status of pension plans on a worldwide basis 
currently  the company s contributions under both the ufcw health care and the pension plans are fixed under the terms of the current agreement which ends on march  except for the suspension period as noted above 
the current economic conditions and the turmoil in the financial markets could have a significant impact on the funded status of the health care and pension plans in which the company participates 
the company anticipates that both health care and pension benefits will be important topics in future negotiations 
if the company and other participating employers are unable to negotiate an acceptable agreement with the union concerning employee benefits  a labor dispute could result or the negotiations could result in a new agreement requiring higher contribution rates 
in addition  if any of the participating employers in the plan withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to cover the underfunded liabilities associated with its participants  the company may be required to make additional contributions 
each of these scenarios could negatively impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
retention of key personnel our success is dependent on our key employees 
we must continue to attract  retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified management and operating personnel including the replacement of senior management upon retirement 
individuals of this caliber are historically in short supply and this shortage may limit our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel  and thus  may hinder our ability to operate effectively 
changes in laws or regulations or failure to comply we are subject to various federal  state and local laws  regulations and licensing requirements which regulate health and sanitation standards  food labeling and handling  the sale of alcoholic beverages  employment practices  working conditions  citizenship requirements and public accommodations 
changes to such laws or regulations may adversely affect our profitability by increasing our costs or affecting the sale of certain items 
in addition  we must comply with state and local fire  zoning  land use and environmental regulations 
failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect the operation of our existing stores or could delay or prevent the opening of a new store 
changes in accounting standards  policies and practices the issuance of new pronouncements or changes to existing accounting policies and practices could have a significant impact on our reported results or change the way we account for various transactions 
new policies and changes to existing rules may adversely affect our reported financial results 
availability and retention of retail space we currently lease the majority of our store locations 
typically  our supermarket leases have initial year lease terms and may include options for up to an additional years 
the average term remaining on our supermarket leases  including renewal options  is approximately years 
our revenues and profitability would be negatively impacted if we are unable to renew these leases at reasonable rates 

table of contents our continued growth depends to a significant degree on our ability to open or acquire new stores in existing and new trade areas and to operate these stores successfully 
our expansion strategy is dependent on finding suitable locations  and we face intense competition from other retailers for such sites 
we may not be able to find suitable locations that meet our demographic requirements at a reasonable cost 
the ability of our vendors to supply products and services in a timely manner our business is dependent on our ability to purchase products from a large wholesaler and numerous smaller vendors in a timely manner and at competitive prices 
the largest supplier for our stores is unified  a grocery wholesale cooperative  which has provided product for our stores for approximately thirty four years 
we currently procure approximately of our product from unified 
any disruption in the business of unified or any of our other principal suppliers could negatively impact our sales and profitability 
even where we have access to alternative sources of supply  the failure of a supplier to meet our demands may temporarily disrupt store level merchandise selection 
ability to control insurance coverage costs and claims experience we use a combination of insurance and self insurance plans to provide for coverage associated with losses related to workers compensation  general and auto liability  property damage  directors and officers liability  fiduciary  employment practices liability  business interruption  crime  earthquake and health care 
if insurance costs increase  it could have a negative impact on our profitability if we are not able to offset the effect of such increases with plan modifications  cost control measures  sales increases or by improving our operating efficiency 
we are self insured for general and auto liability and  in some prior years  for workers compensation as well 
we have stop loss insurance coverage to limit our exposure on a per claim basis and are insured for covered costs in excess of per claim limits 
the company devotes substantial time and effort to maintaining a safe environment in our stores  warehouse and offices 
however  the cost of both insured and self insured plans is highly dependent upon legal and legislative trends  the inflation rate of premiums and our ability to manage claims 
the outcome of current and future legal proceedings from time to time we are the subject of complaints or litigation from customers alleging injury  food quality or operational concerns 
we may be adversely affected by publicity resulting from such allegations  regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable 
we are also subject to complaints or allegations from former or current employees  claims concerning hazardous substances on our current or previously owned properties  class action suits concerning warning labels and other claims 
a lawsuit or claim could result in a decision against us that could have an adverse effect on our business if not covered by insurance 
additionally  the cost of defending ourselves against lawsuits and claims  regardless of merit  could have a negative impact on our profitability 
impact of local projects in the vicinity of our supermarkets from time to time  local events or projects take place in the vicinity of our stores that may have a negative impact on our sales and profitability 

table of contents stock price volatility the market price of our class a common stock class a could be subject to significant fluctuation in response to various market factors and events including general economic and market conditions  variations in our earnings results  publicity regarding us and our competitors and the grocery business in general 
the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
furthermore  there is not a significant volume of trading in our class a which subjects our stock price to a higher level of volatility and may adversely impact the liquidity of the stock 
in march  the company merged its stock bonus plan into its k retirement savings plan k plan in order to satisfy the new congressionally mandated diversification requirements 
stock previously held for the benefit of participants in the company s stock bonus plan was transferred to individual participant accounts in the company s k plan 
as of january   participants in the company s k plan held  shares of class a in the k plan 
these participants can elect to sell their shares which may have a negative effect on the price of class a 
fluctuations in our class a price also impact compensation expense as it relates to our outstanding stock appreciation rights sars

overview arden is a holding company which conducts operations through its first and second tier wholly owned subsidiaries  arden mayfair and gelson s  respectively 
gelson s operates full service supermarkets in southern california 
gelson s caters to the upscale customer who expects superior quality  service and merchandise selection 
in addition to the customary supermarket offerings  gelson s offers specialty items such as imported foods  unusual delicatessen items and 
table of contents organic and natural food products 
all gelson s stores include the typical service departments such as meat  seafood  delicatessen  floral  sushi  cheese and bakery 
in addition  some stores offer further services including fresh pizza  coffee bars  hot bars  gelato bars and carving carts offering cooked meats 
the company s management focuses on a number of performance indicators in evaluating financial condition and results of operations 
same store sales  gross profit and labor costs are some of the key factors that management considers 
both sales and gross profit are significantly influenced by competition in our trade area 
gelson s faces competition from regional and national supermarket chains most of which have greater resources and a larger market share than gelson s  stores specializing in natural and organic foods  specialty and gourmet markets and grocery departments in mass merchandise and club stores 
the recent downturn in economic conditions has led to even greater competition in the grocery industry 
as discretionary income declines  some consumers are reducing their spending and making more value conscious decisions 
we are forced to compete for fewer customer dollars and keep our retail prices low as our competitors also reduce their prices in an attempt to maintain or increase their own market share 
labor and other related payroll costs are the second largest expense after product cost incurred by gelson s  and thus is a financial measure which is carefully monitored by management 
as of fiscal year end  gelson s had approximately  full time and part time store  warehouse and office employees 
the majority of gelson s employees are members of the ufcw 
in february  the company completed negotiation of a new union contract with the ufcw to replace the contract which expired on march  the three major grocery retailers in our trade area had not reached an agreement by this date 
the new gelson s contract starts the elimination process of the two tier wage configuration and returns it to a single wage structure and provides for  among other things  wage increases and modifications to the company s pension and health and welfare contribution rates 
the company s employees who are members of the ufcw voted to ratify the new contract in a vote held on february and  the new contract originally had an expiration date of march  which was different from the expiration date of the majors contract 
effective march   the company s ufcw employees voted to ratify an amendment to our contract with the ufcw which extends the contract expiration date to march   the same date the contract between the ufcw and the majors expires 
the company contributes to a multi employer health care and pension plan trust on behalf of its employees who are members of the ufcw 
all employers who participate in a multi employer plan are required to contribute at the same hourly rate based on straight time hours worked in order to fund the plan 
consequently  the benefit contribution rates that the company negotiated with the ufcw effective march were subject to change retroactively based on the outcome of the union s negotiations with the three major grocery retailers in our trade area which were completed in july the employees of the three major grocery retailers voted to ratify their contract on july  for purposes of the multi employer plans for health care and pension benefits  gelson s is subject to the same contract and term as the majors which expires on march  the agreement reached with the ufcw and the three major grocery retailers resulted in a substantial reduction in the average hourly contribution rates for pension and health care 
the 
table of contents majority of the reduction relates to the health and welfare fund which was overfunded at the time of contract negotiation 
the reduction in the health and welfare contribution rate was originally expected to substantially reduce the overfunded status of the fund during the term of the new contract 
the change in contribution rates for both pension and health care were retroactive to the beginning of march the reduction in the contribution rates resulted in a substantial decrease in the company s selling  general and administrative sg a expense when comparing periods covered by the current and the expired contracts 
the company s health and welfare contribution rate was scheduled to increase effective with hours worked during march and after  however  the company was recently notified by the trust that the increase has been suspended for the six month period beginning march and ending august the trust will review the effective rate again in august current economic conditions and the turmoil in the financial markets could significantly impact the future funded status of the health care and pension plans in which the company participates 
many factors influence the funded status of the plans including changes in the cost of health care  the return on investments of funds held by the plan  changes to benefits offered under the plan and government regulations 
the company anticipates that both health care and pension benefits will be important topics in future negotiations 
if  in the future  the company and other participating employers are unable to negotiate an acceptable agreement with the union concerning employee benefits  a labor dispute could result or the negotiations could result in a new agreement requiring higher contribution rates 
in addition  if any of the participating employers in the plan withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to cover the underfunded liabilities associated with its participants  the company may be required to make additional contributions 
each of these scenarios could negatively impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the agreement that the majors reached with the ufcw also provides for hourly wage rates based on job classification and experience that  in some cases  are less than those agreed to by gelson s 
this could affect our ability to compete with grocery retailers whose hourly rates are less than our own 
increases in wages provided under the new contract will negatively impact the company s profitability unless it is able to offset the increased expense through a combination of sales growth  increased gross margin  management of labor hours  decreased labor turnover and cost savings in other areas 
current economic conditions make it difficult to achieve significant sales growth and increased profit margins 
another component of labor related expense is the cost of workers compensation 
for claims incurred prior to july   the company is primarily self insured through the use of a high deductible policy which provides the company with stop loss coverage to limit its exposure on a per claim basis and provides coverage for qualifying costs in excess of per claim limits 
effective july  the company purchased a one year fully insured guaranteed cost workers compensation insurance policy to replace the high deductible program for losses occurring after june  the guaranteed cost program eliminates the company s risk against claims occurring after june  and has resulted in lower workers compensation expense compared to the high deductible program 
the company has continued to renew the guaranteed cost policy annually 
the company continues to maintain an accrual for claims incurred prior to july under the high deductible program 
that accrual is based on both undeveloped reported claims and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
while the company devotes substantial time and commitment to maintaining a safe work environment  the ultimate cost of 
table of contents workers compensation is highly dependent upon legal and legislative trends  the inflation rate of health care costs and the company s ability to manage claims 
in the past  the company s quarterly results have reflected significant fluctuations in operating income as a result of adjustments recorded to reflect the change in the fair value of sars that have been granted to non employee directors and certain employees 
each sar entitles the holder to receive cash upon exercise equal to the excess of the fair market value of a share of the company s class a  as determined in accordance with the sars agreement  on the date of exercise over the fair market value of such share on the date granted 
fluctuations in the market price of the company s class a from the end of the previous fiscal year impact the recognition or reversal of sars compensation expense in the year being reported upon 
since the company cannot predict future fluctuations in the market price of its stock  it also cannot forecast future sars compensation expense adjustments and the extent to which operating income will be impacted 
results of operations compared to net income in decreased to  compared to  during operating income decreased to  in compared to  in sales from the company s supermarkets all of which are located in southern california  including revenue from licensing arrangements  subleases  leases and finance charges  were  in a week fiscal year

sg a expense as a percent of sales was in compared to in the increase in sg a expense as a percent of sales is primarily due to an increase in ufcw hourly wage rates effective early march in accordance with the current collective bargaining agreement

accruals are based on reported claims and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
while the ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on future developments  in management s opinion  recorded reserves for general and auto liability claims and workers compensation are adequate to cover the future payment of claims 
in addition to high deductible coverage for workers compensation and general and auto liability claims  the company also carries property  business interruption  fiduciary  directors and officers  crime  earthquake  special event and employment practices liability insurance 
management believes  based on recent and past experience  that current insurance coverage meets the reasonable requirements of the company
