item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis provides qualitative and quantitative information about our financial performance and condition and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to those statements 
this discussion consists of the following sections executive overview a description of our business  financial highlights from  information about industry trends and sources of revenues and operating costs  critical accounting policies and estimates a discussion of the accounting policies that are most important in understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in the consolidated financial statements and a summary of recent accounting pronouncements  results of operations a summary of the components of our revenues by category and by network affiliation  a summary of other operating data and an analysis of our revenues and expenses for  and  including comparisons between years and expectations for  and liquidity and capital resources a discussion of our primary sources of liquidity  an analysis of our cash flows from or used in operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  a discussion of our dividend policy and a summary of our contractual cash obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 
executive overview we believe that we are one of the largest and most diversified television broadcasting companies in the united states 
we currently own  provide programming and operating services pursuant to local marketing agreements lmas or provide  or are provided  sales services pursuant to outsourcing agreements to television stations in markets 
for the purpose of this report  these stations are referred to as our stations 
we believe that owning duopolies and operating stations under lmas or providing sales and related services under outsourcing agreements enables us to accomplish two very important strategic business objectives increasing our share of revenues available in each market and operating television stations more efficiently by minimizing costs 
we constantly monitor revenue share and cost efficiencies and we aggressively pursue opportunities to improve both by using new technology and by sharing best practices among our station groups 

table of contents we have two reportable operating segments  broadcast and other operating divisions that are disclosed separately from our corporate activities 
our broadcast segment includes our stations 
currently  our other operating divisions segment primarily earn revenues from information technology staffing  consulting and software development  transmitter manufacturing  sign design and fabrication  regional security alarm operating and bulk acquisitions  and real estate ventures 
corporate costs primarily include our costs to operate as a public company and to operate our corporate headquarters location 
corporate is not a reportable segment 
sinclair television group  inc stg  included in the broadcast segment and a wholly owned subsidiary of sinclair broadcast group  inc sbg which is included in corporate  is the primary obligor under our existing bank credit agreement  as amended and the senior subordinated notes  due our class a common stock  class b common stock  the debentures  the notes and the notes remain obligations or securities of sbg and are not obligations or securities of stg

as a result  we were paid an million termination fee  on march   the fcc released an order requiring  among other things  that each full power television station provides to its viewers  through compliance with one of several alternative sets of rules  certain on air information about the transition to digital television until june  each station is also required to report its activities in this regard to the fcc and place such reports in its public inspection files  in june  we entered into an agreement to purchase the assets of wtvr tv in richmond petersburg  virginia and simultaneously sell the license assets of wrlh tv in richmond  virginia to an unrelated third party 
in august  the us department of justice antitrust division declined the approval of the acquisition of wtvr tv due to a consent decree between the seller and the department of justice  in july  we entered into a news share agreement in which who tv  owned by local tv  llc  will produce a newscast to air on kdsm tv in des moines  iowa  in october  the company received a million federal income tax cash refund  during  we recorded million and million in impairment of goodwill and broadcast licenses  respectively  during  we repurchased on the open market pursuant to a share repurchase plan  million shares of class a common stock for million  including transaction costs  during  we repurchased in the open market million face value of the notes  million of our debentures and million of our notes  during  we acquired million in non television assets which includes million for bay creek south  llc and million for jefferson park development  llc  during  we made new investments of million and add on cash investments of million primarily in real estate ventures and million in private investment funds  and market share survey results reflect that our stations share of the television advertising market  excluding political  in increased to  from in other highlights on february   congress passed the dtv delay act that extends the date for the completion of the dtv transition from february  to june  pursuant to the rules and with the consent of the fcc all but of our stations ceased analog operations on the original february  dates  as of the filing date  in first quarter  we repurchased in the open market million of our convertible senior notes  due  and million of the debentures  and as of the filing date  in first quarter  we repurchased million shares of class a common stock for million  including transaction costs 

table of contents industry trends political advertising increases in even numbered years  such as  due to the advertising expenditures from candidates running in local and national elections 
in every fourth year  such as  political advertising is elevated further due to the presidential election 
in addition  political revenue has consistently risen between election years such as from to  on february   congress passed the dtv delay act that extends the date for the termination of analog transmission from february  to june  based on the latest dtv delay act  all broadcast television stations must terminate broadcasting the analog signal  the fcc has permitted broadcast television stations to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services including multi channel broadcasts 
the fcc must carry rules only apply to a station s primary digital stream  a number of other broadcasters  including sinclair  have joined together in what is known as the open mobile video coalition to promote the development of mobile digital broadcasting applications 
we believe there is potential for broadcasters to create an additional revenue stream by providing their signals to mobile devices  retransmission consent rules provide a mechanism for broadcasters to seek payment from multi channel video programming distributors mvpds who carry broadcasters signals 
recognition of the value of the programming content provided by broadcasters has generated a sustainable  annual payment stream which we expect to continue to grow  automotive related advertising is a significant portion of our total net revenues in all periods presented and these revenues have been trending downward especially in and as of the date of this filing due to the recent economic turmoil  many broadcasters are enhancing upgrading their websites to use the internet to deliver rich media content  such as newscasts and weather updates  to attract advertisers  seasonal advertising increases in the second and fourth quarters due to the anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers  although this trend may be disrupted due to the recession  rating service fees are likely to increase as nielsen rolls out its people meter and audience measurement devices  broadcasters have found ways to increase returns on their news programming initiatives while continuing to maintain locally produced content through the use of news sharing arrangements  station outsourcing arrangements are becoming more common as broadcasters seek out ways to improve revenues and margins  advertising revenue related to the olympics occurs in even numbered years and the super bowl is aired on a different network each year 
both of these popularly viewed events can have an impact on our advertising revenues  and compensation from networks to their affiliates in exchange for broadcasting of network programming has significantly declined in recent years 
sources of revenues and costs the spot market includes advertising time purchased from individual stations 
local spots are purchased in one market and aimed only at the audience in that particular market while national spots are bought by national advertisers in several markets 
the upfront market relates to when networks sell national advertising time for a full broadcast year through an upfront negotiation typically in may 
the scatter market is when networks sell advertising time from available unsold inventory at rates different from those obtained during the upfront 
most of our revenues are generated from the transactional spot market rather than the traditional upfront and scatter markets that networks access 
these operating revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  from political advertisers 
from to  we generated significant new revenues from our retransmission consent agreements 
these agreements have helped to produce a new  viable revenue stream that has replaced the steady decline in revenues from television network compensation 
while we expect revenues from our retransmission consent agreements to continue to grow over the next fiscal year and beyond  these revenues may not significantly increase at the rates  such as the increase from to  since our significant mvpds are under contract 
however  as contracts expire we expect to negotiate favorable terms to grow our revenue stream 
in addition  most contracts contain automatic annual fee escalators 
our revenues from local advertisers had seen a continued upward trend until when non political revenues fell from due to the economic recession 
revenues from national advertisers have continued to trend downward when measured as a percentage of total broadcast revenues 
we believe this trend is the result of our focus on increasing local advertising revenues as a percentage of total advertising revenues  combined with a decrease in overall spending by national advertisers and an increase in the number of competitive media outlets providing national advertisers multiple alternatives in which to advertise their goods or services 
our efforts to mitigate the effect of these increasingly competitive media outlets for national advertisers include continuing our efforts to increase local revenues and developing innovative sales and marketing strategies to sell traditional and non traditional services to our advertisers 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts  program contract costs  intangible assets  income taxes  property and equipment  investments and derivative contracts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates have been consistently applied for all years presented in this report and in the past we have not experienced material differences between these estimates and actual results 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of goodwill  long lived assets and intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill  broadcast licenses  long lived assets and intangible assets for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on estimated future cash flows  market conditions  operating performance of our stations and legal factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the net book value of long lived assets and intangible assets is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations 
we have determined our broadcast licenses to be indefinite lived intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  which requires such assets along with our goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more often when certain triggering events occur 
as of december   we had million of goodwill  million in broadcast licenses  and million in definite lived intangibles 
we test our broadcast licenses and broadcast goodwill by estimating the fair market value of the broadcast licenses  or the fair value of our reporting units in the case of goodwill  using a combination of quoted market prices  observed earnings cash flow multiples paid for comparable television stations  discounted cash flow models and appraisals 
we then compare the estimated fair market value to the book value of these assets to determine if an impairment exists 
we aggregate our stations by market for purposes of our goodwill and license impairment testing and we believe that our markets are most representative of our broadcast reporting units because we view  manage and evaluate our stations on a market basis 
furthermore  in our markets operated as duopolies  certain costs of operating the stations are shared including the use of buildings and equipment  the sales force and administrative personnel 
our discounted cash flow model is based on our judgment of future market conditions within each designated marketing area  as well as discount rates that would be used by market participants in an arms length transaction 
future events could cause us to conclude that market conditions have declined or discount rates have increased to the extent that our broadcast licenses and or goodwill could be impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows 
based on assessments performed during the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in impairment losses on our goodwill and broadcast licenses 
the impairment charge taken in was primarily due to the severe economic downturn during the fourth quarter  and as a result  we made downward revisions to forecasted cash flow  cash flow multiples and growth rates 
there was no impairment recorded for the year ended december  the implied value of our broadcast goodwill is calculated using a discounted cash flow model for years and estimating the terminal value of the reporting units using a multiple of cash flows 
the value of our broadcast licenses is calculated using a discounted cash flow model for years and estimating the terminal value based on the constant growth model and a compound annual growth rate 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units to test our goodwill for impairment and broadcast licenses in were as follows goodwill broadcast licenses revenue annual growth rate expense annual growth rate discount rate comparable business multiple constant growth rate times cash flow 
table of contents an increase in our discount rate of would increase our goodwill impairment by million and a decrease in our multiple of would increase our goodwill impairment by million 
an increase in our discount rate of greater than or a decrease in our multiple of greater than would likely change the number of reporting units that would fail our step test of fas and could lead to additional amounts of goodwill impairment 
revenue recognition 
advertising revenues  net of agency commissions  are recognized in the period during which time spots are aired 
all other revenues are recognized as services are provided 
the revenues realized from station barter arrangements are recorded as the programs are aired at the estimated fair value of the advertising airtime given in exchange for the program rights 
our retransmission consent agreements contain both advertising and retransmission consent elements that are paid in cash 
we have determined that our agreements are revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and fall within the scope of eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
advertising and retransmission consent deliverables sold under our agreements are separated into different units of accounting based on fair value 
revenue applicable to the advertising element of the arrangement is recognized consistent with the advertising revenue policy noted above 
revenue applicable to the retransmission consent element of the arrangement is recognized ratably over the life of the agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from extending credit to our customers that are unable to make required payments 
if the economy and or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
for example  a increase in the balance of our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december   would reduce net income available to common shareholders by approximately million 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
program contract costs 
we have agreements with distributors for the rights to televise programming over contract periods  which generally run from one to seven years 
contract payments are made in installments over terms that are generally equal to or shorter than the contract period 
each contract is recorded as an asset and a liability at an amount equal to its gross cash contractual commitment when the license period begins and the program is available for its first showing 
the portion of program contracts which become payable within one year is reflected as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in program contract assets and million and million  respectively  in program contract liabilities 
the programming rights are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value nrv 
estimated nrvs are based on management s expectation of future advertising revenue  net of sales commissions  to be generated by the remaining program material available under the contract terms 
in conjunction with our nrv analysis of programming rights reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  we perform similar analysis on future programming rights yet to be reflected in our consolidated balance sheets and establish allowances when future payments exceed the estimated nrv 
amortization of program contract costs is generally computed using a four year accelerated method or a straight line method  depending on the length of the contract 
program contract costs estimated by management to be amortized within one year are classified as current assets 
program contract liabilities are typically paid on a scheduled basis and are not reflected by adjustments for amortization or estimated nrv 
if our estimate of future advertising revenues declines  then additional write downs to nrv may be required 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
as of december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in deferred tax assets and million and million  respectively  in deferred tax liabilities 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine  based on the weight of available evidence  that is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   valuation allowances have been provided for a substantial amount of our available federal and state nols 
management periodically performs a comprehensive review of our tax positions and accrues amounts for tax contingencies 
based on these reviews  the status of ongoing audits and the expiration of applicable statute of limitations  accruals are adjusted as necessary in accordance with the recognition provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no revised  business combinations fas r 
fas r requires an acquiring entity to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
in addition to new disclosure requirements  fas r also makes the following significant changes acquisition costs are expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests are valued at fair value at the acquisition date  acquired contingencies are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently re measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for non acquired contingencies  in process research and development costs are recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs are 
table of contents expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally affect income tax expense 
this statement is effective for business combinations in which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  and early adoption is prohibited 
this statement could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements if we make future acquisitions 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
fas 
this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
changes in a parent s ownership interest that result in deconsolidation of a subsidiary will result in the recognition of a gain or loss in net income when the subsidiary is deconsolidated 
fas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
the statement is effective for fiscals years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  this statement will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

fsp fas amends fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements fas to exclude fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases fas  and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions 
the fasb decided to exclude leasing transactions covered by fas except those arising from a business combination in order to allow it to more broadly consider the use of fair value measurements for these transactions as part of its project to comprehensively reconsider the accounting for leasing transactions 
fas delays the effective date of fas for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
the fsp states that the application of fas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities will be delayed until fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
fas was issued in september and defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we applied the provisions of this statement for the year ended the application of fas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb standard position fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
this fsp requires issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion to account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
issuers will need to determine the carrying value of just the liability portion of the debt by measuring the fair value of a similar liability including any embedded features other than the conversion option that does not have an associated equity component 
the excess of the initial proceeds received from the debt issuance and the fair value of the liability component should be recorded as a debt discount with the offset recorded to equity 
the discount will be amortized to interest expense using the interest method over the life of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component 
transaction costs incurred with third parties shall be allocated between the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of proceeds and accounted for as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs  respectively  with the debt issuance costs amortized to interest expense 
this fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is not permitted 
this statement will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented as of the beginning of the first period presented  first quarter  with an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
in  we will record the impact of this statement retrospectively by recording additional interest expense on our convertible senior notes  due the notes of approximately million for the year ended december  and approximately million for the year ended december  we expect to record additional interest expense of approximately million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the interest expense assumes the exercise of our notes in may in june  the fasb issued fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
this fsp clarifies that unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities as defined in eitf  participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
and should therefore be included in the computation of earnings per share 
our restricted stock awards are considered participating securities in accordance with this fsp 
this fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in addition  all prior period earnings per share data shall be adjusted retrospectively 
the impact of this issue will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

see political revenues below for more information 
our largest categories of advertising and their approximate percentages of net time sales were automotive  professional services  political  schools  fast food and paid programming 
no other advertising category accounted for more than of our net time sales in no advertiser accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue in we conduct business with thousands of advertisers 
net broadcast revenues 
from a revenue category standpoint  the year ended december   when compared to  was impacted by increases in advertising revenues from political  media  fast food  and entertainment  offset by decreases in automotive  retail  movies  paid programming  medical and restaurants 
automotive  our single largest category  representing of the year s net time sales  was down political revenues 
political revenues kept and net time sales higher than because and were both election years 
for the year ended december   political revenues increased from million to million when compared to the same period in we attribute this increase to a presidential election year in and having stations in of the so called battleground states  including five stations in ohio and north carolina  multiple stations in each of florida  iowa  missouri  nevada  pennsylvania  virginia  wisconsin and one station in michigan and minnesota 
for the year ended december   political revenues were only million because was not an election year 
accordingly  we expect political revenues to significantly decrease in from levels 
local revenues 
our revenues from local advertisers  excluding political revenues  decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in this decrease was primarily due to current negative financial and economic conditions which have impeded advertising spending levels  partially offset by million in revenues from our stations in cedar rapids  iowa including kfxa tv acquired in february and kgan tv which was previously accounted for as an outsourcing agreement 
in addition  the decrease was partially offset by an increase of million in our fox stations due to a change in networks for the super bowl programming from cbs to fox 
the change in networks from fox to nbc in negatively impacted our revenues 
national revenues 
our revenues from national advertisers  excluding political revenues decreased million during the year ended december   when compared to the same period in and have continued to trend downward over time 
we believe this trend represents a shift in the way national advertising dollars are being spent and we believe this trend will continue in the future 
advertisers in major categories like automotive  soft drink and packaged goods have shifted significant portions of their advertising budgets away from spot television into non traditional media  in store promotions and product placement in network shows 
automotive decreases are primarily due to automotive related companies reducing advertising budgets and shifting advertising to specific markets 
in addition  similar to local revenues  national revenues have been affected by the current negative financial and economic conditions which have impeded advertising spending levels 
other revenues 
our other revenues consist primarily of revenues from retransmission consent agreements with multi channel video programming distributors mvpds  network compensation  production revenues and revenues from our outsourcing agreements 
our retransmission consent agreements  including the advertising component  generated million in total 
table of contents broadcast revenues during compared with million in and million in this growth trend is the result of our ability to monetize our existing relationships as cable providers struggle with increased competition from alternative video delivery providers and have begun to recognize the value of our digital and high definition signals and local and other programming 
we expect to continue to generate revenues from retransmission consent agreements at terms as favorable as or more favorable than our existing agreements upon the expiration of those agreements 
many of our retransmission consent agreements include automatic annual fee escalators 
however  we may not continue at the current growth rate since most of the mvpds that we conduct business with are under contract

table of contents expense of million and other expenses of million offset by decreases in personal property taxes of million and non income based taxes of million 
we expect station production and station selling  general and administrative expenses to be down from amortization of program contract costs and net realizable value adjustments 
the amortization of program contract costs decreased during compared to primarily due to a decrease in write downs of our program contract costs of million and program amortization of million 
the amortization increase during compared to was primarily due to an increase of million in write downs of our program contract costs partially offset by a decrease in program amortization of million 
we expect program contract amortization expense to decrease in when compared to corporate general and administrative expenses 
corporate general and administrative expenses represent the costs to operate our corporate headquarters location 
costs are allocated to the broadcast segment  other operating divisions segment and corporate and include  among other things  departmental salaries  bonuses  fringe benefits and other compensation  health and other insurance  rent  telephone  consulting fees  legal fees and strategic development initiatives

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalent balances and negative working capital of approximately million

usually  the second and fourth quarter operating results are higher than the first and third quarters because advertising expenditures are increased in anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers 
the current negative financial and economic conditions may effect the usual seasonal fluctuations 
our operating results are usually subject to fluctuations from political advertising 
in even numbered years  political spending is usually significantly higher than in odd numbered years due to advertising expenditures preceding local and national elections 
additionally  every four years  political spending is elevated further due to advertising expenditures preceding the presidential election  although this trend may be disrupted due to the recession 
contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
we enter into derivative instruments primarily for the purpose of reducing the impact of changing interest rates on our floating rate debt and to reduce the impact of changing fair market values on our fixed rate debt 
we account for our derivative instruments under fas no 
fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
for additional information on fas  see note derivative instruments  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
as of january   we had two remaining derivative instruments 
both of these instruments were interest rate swap agreements 
one of these swap agreements  with a notional amount of million and an expiration date of march   was accounted for as a fair value hedge in accordance with fas  therefore  any changes in its fair market value were reflected as an adjustment to the carrying value of our senior subordinated notes  due  which was the underlying debt being hedged 
the interest we paid on the million swap was variable based on the three month libor plus and the interest we received was fixed at 
the other interest rate swap  with a notional amount of million and an expiration date of march   was undesignated as a fair value hedge in due to a reassignment of the counterparty  therefore  any subsequent changes in the fair market value were reflected as an adjustment to income 
the interest we paid on the million swap was variable based on the three month libor plus and the interest we received was fixed at in february  the counterparty to our swap agreements  elected to change the termination dates of the million and million swaps to march  and march   respectively 
we received a termination fee of million from the counterparty for the early termination of the million swap 
after the removal of the related million derivative asset from our consolidated balance sheet  the resulting million  along with million of interest was recorded in gain from derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of operations 
we received a termination fee of million from the counterparty for the early termination of the million swap 
in accordance with fas  the carrying value of the underlying debt was adjusted to reflect the million termination fee and that amount is treated as a premium on the underlying debt that was being hedged and is amortized over its remaining life as a reduction to interest expense 
the total termination fees received of million are included in the cash flows from financing activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  under certain circumstances  we will pay contingent cash interest to the holder of the notes and the notes commencing on may  and january   respectively 
the contingent cash interest feature for both issuances are embedded derivatives which have negligible fair values 
our notes and notes have put option features which are discussed in more detail below 
during  we repurchased on the open market million of our existing notes 
as of december   the outstanding face amount of the notes was million 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our term loans and revolving credit facility 
these outstanding amounts accrue interest with a variable rate and therefore increase our risk to increases from interest rates 
we repurchased on the open market million of our notes during the year ended december  as of december   the outstanding face amount of the notes was million 
during  we repurchased on the open market million of our debentures 
as of december   the outstanding face value of the debentures was million 
we are exposed to risk from a change in interest rates to the extent we are required to refinance existing fixed rate indebtedness at rates higher than those prevailing at the time the existing indebtedness was incurred 
based on the quoted market price  the fair value of the notes  notes  notes and debentures combined was billion as of december  we estimate that a increase from prevailing interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of these notes by million as of december  generally  the fair market value of these notes will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall 
interest rates decreased during  particularly in the fourth quarter  however the fair market value of our notes fell significantly as a result of the extraordinary credit market conditions 
our notes have been acutely affected by the perceived 
table of contents heightened liquidity risk prevailing in the market place and our ability to refinance debt 
holders of our notes and notes may require us to repurchase the notes for cash at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest in may and january  respectively 
based on our current common stock trading price levels  it is highly probable that holders will exercise their right to put the notes and notes to us 
the conversion price for the notes and notes are and  respectively 
if we are required to repurchase our notes and notes  we may access capital markets to secure debt and equity financing 
the timing  terms  size and pricing of any debt and equity financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing 
as a result  we may not be able to refinance or extinguish these notes on the put dates 
the inability to successfully refinance or extinguish these notes upon a put could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and the value of our securities 
currently we are exploring alternative solutions relative to the potential put of these notes
