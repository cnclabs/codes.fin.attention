item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
see item a risk factors regarding certain factors known to genvec that could cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future results  including discussions of the risks related to the development  regulatory approval  manufacture  proprietary protection of our product candidates  and their market success relative to alternative products 
overview genvec  inc genvec  we  our  or the company is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel  gene based therapeutic drugs and vaccines 
our lead therapeutic product candidate  tnferade tm biologic tnferade  is being developed for use in the treatment of cancer 
tnferade is currently the subject of a 
table of contents randomized  controlled  phase iii pivotal trial  known as pact  for first line treatment of inoperable  locally advanced pancreatic cancer 
interim data supporting a potential survival advantage in the tnferade group were disclosed in november interim data  based on an analysis after one third of deaths expected in the trial  demonstrated an approximately lower risk of death in the tnferade plus standard of care soc arm relative to the soc arm alone hazard ratio  confidence interval 
an independent data safety monitoring board reviewed the interim analysis data and recommended the trial continue as planned 
in november  tnferade was granted fast track designation by the us food and drug administration fda for its proposed use in the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer 
fast track designation can potentially expedite the regulatory review of tnferade by the fda 
our product candidates also have not yet received regulatory approvals  either from the fda for the united states or from regulatory agencies outside of the united states  which approvals are required before we can market them as therapeutic and or vaccine products 
in order to proceed to subsequent clinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval in the united states  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy 
historically  the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
a number of new drugs and biologic products have shown promising results in early clinical trials  but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
an element of our business strategy is to pursue  as resources permit  the research and development of a range of product candidates for a variety of indications 
this is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures 
to the extent we are unable to maintain a broad range of product candidates  our dependence on the success of one or a few product candidates would increase 
furthermore  our business strategy includes the option of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
in the event that third parties take over the clinical trial process for one or more of our product candidates  the estimated completion date would largely be under the control of that third party rather than us 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products or indications  if any  will be subject to future collaborative arrangements  in whole or in part  and how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements 
our programs may also benefit from subsidies  grants  or government or agency sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  we are unable to estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when  if ever  and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
furthermore  the current domestic and global economic conditions have made it more difficult for companies like us to access the financial and credit markets 
prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions  such as the current economic conditions  or further disruptions of either or both of the financial and credit markets will further adversely affect our ability to access additional capital 
while our estimated future capital requirements are uncertain and will depend on  and could increase or decrease as a result of many factors  including the extent to which we choose to advance our research  development  clinical  manufacturing  and commercialization activities  it is clear we will need significant additional capital to develop our product candidates through clinical development  manufacturing  and commercialization 
the continued advancement of tnferade through the phase iii portion of the pivotal trial for locally advanced pancreatic cancer  the fda regulatory review process  and the establishment of manufacturing capabilities will continue to require capital  and we expect to have to incur significant additional costs to manufacture and commercialize tnferade if we receive marketing approval 
we do not know whether we will be able to access additional capital when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 

table of contents our research and development expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these expenses were divided between our research and development platforms in the following manner

year ended december  in millions tnferade vaccines other clinical programs total tnferade 
our lead cancer product candidate is currently being studied in a pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer and two phase i ii trials for head and neck cancer 
genvec has incurred million of expenses on the development of this product candidate since the commencement of this program in costs since the commencement of this program include research  development  clinical trials  clinical supply costs  and an allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses 
genvec expects to continue to expend substantial additional amounts for the clinical development and commercialization of tnferade 
vaccines 
under our corporate and government funded vaccine programs  genvec continues to develop vaccine candidates against malaria  hiv  rsv  hsv  and other infectious diseases  as well as an animal health vaccine for foot and mouth disease fmd 
since commencement of these vaccine development programs in  genvec has incurred approximately million in research and development costs  including an allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses  most of which have been funded by various sponsors under cost reimbursement agreements 
to date  none of our proprietary or collaborative programs has resulted in a commercial product  therefore  we have not received any revenues or royalties from the sale of products 
we have funded our operations primarily through public and private placements of equity securities  payments received under collaborative programs with public and private entities  and debt financings 
we have incurred operating losses each year since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development and from general and administrative activities 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  sponsored research costs  patent costs  technology access fees  clinical trial costs  and other expenses related to our product development and research programs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  facility costs  professional fees  business development costs  insurance premiums  and other general corporate expenditures 
the current domestic and global economic conditions have made it more difficult for companies like us to access the financial and credit markets or to otherwise obtain liquidity 
while we expect that overall revenues from funded collaborations in will have a modest increase as compared to the revenues from funded collaborations  we have taken and are continuing to take steps to lower our operating costs in order to reduce costs 
these steps included announcing on january  that we were eliminating positions 
further  where possible  we are minimizing our unfunded expenditures on activities that are not critical to the clinical development of tnferade 
this includes reducing our spending on contract manufacturing 
we are currently discussing with our contract manufacturer amending the service schedule to our contract manufacturing agreement to reduce both services and costs during the year period of the agreement or potentially terminating the agreement 
we expect that lowering costs  in addition to increased revenues from funded collaborations  will provide us with operating capital through at least the second quarter of we estimate that we will incur approximately  of expenses in the first quarter of due to the reduction of our workforce 

table of contents critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates using authoritative pronouncements  historical experience  and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we have discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions 
for a discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note of the notes to financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical because they require significant estimates or judgment on the part of management revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
consequently  we recognize revenues when a contract is executed  the contract price is fixed and determinable  delivery of the service or products has occurred  and collectability of the contract amounts is considered probable 
our collaborative research and development agreements can provide for upfront license fees  research payments  and or milestone payments 
in accordance with sab  upfront nonrefundable fees associated with license and development agreements where we have continuing involvement in the agreement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated service period 
if the estimated service period is subsequently modified  the period over which the upfront fee is recognized is modified accordingly on a prospective basis 
non refundable research and development fees for which no future performance obligations exist are recognized when collection is assured 
research and development revenue from cost reimbursement and cost plus fixed fee agreements is recognized as earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
revisions in revenues  cost  and billing factors eg indirect rate estimates are accounted for in the period of change 
reimbursable costs under such contracts are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment 
contract revenues and accounts receivable reported in the financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be received 
contract revenues are adjusted to actual upon final audit and retroactive adjustment 
estimated contractual allowances are provided based on our evaluation of current contract terms and past experience with disallowed costs and reimbursement levels 
payments received in advance of work performed are recorded as deferred revenue 
clinical trial expenses and research and development activities 
we accrue estimated costs for clinical and preclinical studies based on estimates of work performed 
we believe this method best aligns our expenses with the efforts we expend 
we monitor the progress of the trials and their related activities to the extent possible and adjust the accruals accordingly 
adjustments to accruals are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the adjustment become known  all adjustments to date have been inconsequential 
the expenditures necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty  and intended use of a product candidate 

table of contents we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following timelines

clinical phase estimated completion date phase i years phase ii years phase iii years the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of the results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  and the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
we test potential product candidates in preclinical studies to identify indications for which they may be product candidates 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or for certain indications in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or indications 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation under fasb statement no 
r  share based payment statement r 
statement r requires that all stock based compensation be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and such cost be measured at the fair value of the award 
for stock based awards granted after january   we recognize compensation expense based on estimated grant date fair value using the black scholes option pricing model 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued fsp fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp fas  with an immediate effective date including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
fsp fas amends fas to clarify the application of fair value in inactive markets and allows for the use of management s internal assumptions about future cash flows with appropriately risk adjusted discount rates when relevant observable market data do not exist 
the objective of fas has not changed and continues to determine the price that would be received in an orderly transaction not a forced liquidation or distressed sale at the measurement date 
the adoption of fsp fas did not have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
in december  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf  which defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting and disclosure requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangements and third parties 
eitf is effective for periods beginning after december  and applies to arrangements in existence as of the effective date 
our adoption of eitf in is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after december  are not expected to have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations 
see note in our notes to financial statements for information regarding other recent accounting pronouncements 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and revenue revenue 
revenue increased percent to million in from million in the increase in is primarily due to increased revenue associated with our agreement with the department of homeland security dhs of million 
the higher revenue under the dhs agreement is a result of increased work scope and effort in as a result of the exercise of the first and second renewal options under the agreement as compared to the period 
the increased revenue associated with our dhs agreement has been partially offset by decreased revenue of million under our hiv program as compared to the comparable prior year period 
this decrease is mostly due to the successful completion of the defined process development  technology transfer  and analytical method transfer activities under our hiv agreements 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses increased percent to million in from million in the increase is primarily due to higher costs related to the development of tnferade including manufacturing and materials costs  patient and data management costs  professional service costs related to our tnferade pancreatic clinical trial  and increased personnel costs  which includes an increase of approximately  of stock based compensation expense in as compared to the prior year 
also contributing to the increased costs  but to a lesser extent  are increased pass through costs associated with our funded programs  most notably pass through costs associated with our fmd program 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased percent to million in from million in general and administrative expenses were lower in primarily due to lower personnel costs  recruiting costs  and depreciation expense  partially offset by higher professional service costs 
administrative personnel costs includes severance expenses of approximately  for former employees  a decrease of approximately  as compared to  and an increase of approximately  of stock based compensation expense in as compared to the prior year 
gain loss on disposal of assets 
there was a gain on the disposal of assets of  in and a loss of  in other income loss total other income decreased from million in to  in interest income was  in as compared to million in the comparable prior year period 
the decrease in interest income is due to lower investment balances and lower yields earned on our portfolio 
interest expense for the period ending december  decreased  as compared to the comparable prior year period due to the declining balances of our debt obligations and a decrease due to adjustments in the fair value of the warrant liability associated with our committed equity financing facility ceff with kingsbridge capital ltd 
kingsbridge in as compared to the comparable period in other income loss was a loss of  in as compared to income of  in the loss in is due mainly to the recording of a  loss associated with an other than temporary decline in the fair value of a marketable equity security  partially offset by miscellaneous discounts and interest payments received from the government associated with late payments 
the income in is due primarily to the receipt of an insurance settlement of  due to a casualty loss  the receipt of equity  valued at  from a third party in exchange for the release of security interests and miscellaneous discounts and interest payments from the government associated with late payments 

table of contents years ended december  and revenue revenue 
revenue decreased percent to million in from million in the decrease in revenue is primarily a result of the successful completion of the one time production of clinical grade hiv vaccine supplies for a phase iib proof of concept trial to be conducted by nih for which we were reimbursed under our contract 
this resulted in a year to year reduction of million in revenues 
the decrease is also due  to a lesser extent  to the expiration of funding of our collaboration with fuso pharmaceutical industries of japan  effective december   for the development of targeted cancer therapies 
these decreases were partially offset by revenue earned under our year contract signed in january with the dhs for the development of vaccine and anti viral candidates for the prevention and containment of fmd 
this contract has resulted in a year to year increase of million in revenues 
to a lesser degree  revenue declines were partially offset by the additional funding we received and recognized under our amended and extended collaborative research  development  and supply agreement with the path malaria vaccine initiative to continue advancing a new multivalent malaria vaccine toward clinical evaluation 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses decreased percent to million in from million in the decrease is primarily due to lower pass through costs under our nih funded hiv vaccine development contract 
the decrease was partially offset by higher costs related to the continuing clinical evaluation of tnferade in our pivotal trial for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer and increased personnel costs which includes an increase of approximately  of stock based compensation expense in as compared to the prior year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased percent to million in from million in general and administrative expenses were lower in primarily due to decreased professional fees  facilities and depreciation costs  partially offset by higher administrative personnel costs including severance expenses of approximately  for former employees  and an increase of approximately  of stock based compensation expense in as compared to the prior year 
loss on disposal of assets 
there was a loss on disposal of assets of  in and no loss in other income loss total other income increased to million in from  in interest income was million in as compared to million in the comparable prior year period 
the increase in interest income is due to higher investment balances as well as higher yields earned on our portfolio 
interest expense  net of the change in the fair value of the kingsbridge warrants  decreased  for the period ending december  as compared to the comparable prior year period 
this was due to the declining balances of our debt obligations and a reduction in interest expense due to a decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability associated with our ceff with kingsbridge in as compared to the comparable period in other income loss increased  in resulting from the receipt of an insurance settlement of  due to a casualty loss and the receipt of equity  valued at  from a third party in exchange for the release of security interests 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have experienced significant losses since our inception 
as of december  we have an accumulated deficit of million 
the process of developing and commercializing our product candidates requires significant research and development work and clinical trial work  as well as significant manufacturing and process development efforts 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  are expected to continue to result in significant operating losses for the foreseeable future 
as of december   cash and investments totaled million as compared to million at december  for the months ended december   we used net cash of million for operating activities 
this consisted of a net loss for the period of million  which included approximately  of non cash depreciation and amortization and million of non cash stock option expenses 
net cash was used primarily for the advancement of our tnferade pancreatic clinical trial  including our manufacturing activities  and to a lesser extent general and administrative activities 
net cash provided from investing activities during the months ended december  was million  which was net of approximately  of property and equipment purchases 
net cash provided from financing activities during the months ended december  was million  which included million from the issuance of common stock and warrants  net of issuance costs and million from the issuance of common stock under our ceff with kingsbridge 
partially offsetting the cash provided by our financing activities is the repayment of our debt obligations of approximately historically we have entered into agreements with academic medical institutions and contract research organizations to perform research and development activities and with clinical sites for the treatment of patients under clinical protocols 
such contracts expire at various dates and have differing renewal and expiration clauses 
we also utilize different financing instruments  such as debt and capital and or operating leases  to finance various equipment and facility needs 
in january  we entered into a manufacturing development agreement with cobra biomanufacturing plc to produce commercial quantities of tnferade  our lead product candidate 
the manufacturing development agreement covers technology transfer  scale up  and validation of the manufacturing process for tnferade through cgmp consistency lots 
under the terms of the agreement  we made an advance payment of million 
this advance payment is accounted for in accordance with eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments  which requires us to defer and capitalize nonrefundable advance payments until the related services are performed 
in  we expensed  of this advance payment 
in  we expensed million in total under the terms of the contract 
amounts to be paid under the agreement could total up to million in the aggregate based on estimated service activities over the year term of the agreement 
we have not authorized any additional services to be performed under this agreement 
we are currently discussing with our contract manufacturer amending the service schedule to reduce both services and costs during the remaining period of the service schedule or potentially terminating the agreement 
we may not be able to amend the service schedule on terms that are favorable to us  and the contract manufacturer and we have different understandings of the amount of services that have been provided and the costs that have been incurred to date 
if we or the manufacturer terminate this agreement  then under certain conditions we believe that we may be required to pay a termination fee that ranges from to million depending on the timing of and the reason for termination 
in the event of termination  the contract manufacturer may also seek to have us pay additional amounts for services that it asserts have been provided prior to the date of termination 

table of contents our external research  clinical study  financing and other contractual commitments and obligations are summarized in the following table

the amount shown reflects the amount of the termination fee that we believe is provided for by the manufacturing agreement and not necessarily the amount that we will be required to pay in  either as a result of services that may be provided in the future  including if the agreement is not terminated  or as a result of services that the contract manufacturer may assert have been provided prior to any date of termination 
as discussed above  if we are to continue the agreement  we will seek to amend the service schedule to reduce both services and costs during the remaining period of the service schedule 
accordingly  in lieu of the amounts under the current work schedule  which calls for  in and  in  the table shows what we believe to be the maximum termination fee without any payments for services that the contract manufacturer may assert have been provided prior to the date of termination 
in march  we signed an amendment to our lease agreement for our gaithersburg facilities extending the lease expiration date from november  until october  under the terms of the amendment  in addition to the amounts reflected in operating leases  we have additional contractual obligations of  in   in   in   in   in  and  thereafter 
on march   we entered into a ceff  under which kingsbridge committed to purchase up to million of our common stock within a year period  subject to certain conditions and limitations 
due to the pricing formula  however  the actual amount of additional financing available to us under the ceff at any time may be substantially less than the committed amount 
under the ceff  we may require kingsbridge to purchase shares of common stock at prices between percent and percent of the volume weighted average price vwap on each trading day during an day pricing period 
settlement for sales under the ceff takes place in two tranches after the fourth and eighth day of the pricing period 
kingsbridge is not obligated to purchase shares at prices below the greater of or percent of the closing price of our common stock on the day prior to the commencement of the pricing period 
in addition  the maximum number of shares that we may issue under the ceff is  prior to december   we had drawn million and issued  shares of common stock under the ceff 
in april  we initiated our second draw against the ceff 
on april   subsequent to the first days of the pricing period  we sold  shares of common stock for gross proceeds of million 
the pricing period ended on april   at which time we sold an additional  shares of common stock under the ceff for gross proceeds of million 
as a result of the pricing restrictions described above  we have not been able to require kingsbridge to purchase shares of common stock since october the ceff will expire on march  on february   we filed with the securities and exchange commission a million shelf registration statement on form s the shelf registration statement was declared effective february  and allows us to obtain financing through the issuance of any combination of common stock  preferred stock  warrants  or debt securities 
however  sec rules limit our ability to use the shelf registration  including by generally providing that until such time as the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non affiliates is million or more  we may only sell pursuant to the shelf registration statement up to one third of the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non affiliates in any month period 

table of contents on june   pursuant to our shelf registration statement  we completed a registered direct offering to various investors of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the shares of common stock and warrants were offered in units consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at a per unit price of 
the warrants  which have a term of years and an exercise price of per share  have been valued using the black scholes pricing model as of the closing date and have been accounted for in permanent equity 
proceeds of this offering  net of offering costs  totaled million 
our estimated future capital requirements are uncertain and could change materially as a result of many factors  including the progress of our research  development  clinical  manufacturing  and commercialization activities 
we have also taken and are continuing to take steps to lower our operating costs in order to preserve cash 
these steps included our announcement on january  that we were eliminating positions 
we currently estimate we will use approximately million to million of cash in the months ending december  our estimate includes approximately million in contractual obligations reflected in the table above  as well as million for capital expenditures 
this estimate includes our view of the potential payment of the maximum termination fee under our contract manufacturing agreement as discussed in footnote to the table above 
based on this estimate we would have sufficient resources to fund our operations through the second quarter of however  significant additional capital will be required to develop our product candidates through clinical development  manufacturing  and commercialization  including the continued advancement of tnferade through the phase iii portion of the pivotal trial for locally advanced pancreatic cancer  the fda regulatory review process for tnferade  and the establishment of manufacturing capabilities for tnferade 
we may seek additional capital through further public or private equity offerings  debt financing  additional strategic alliance and licensing arrangements  collaborative arrangements  or some combination of these financing alternatives 
the current domestic and global economic conditions have made it more difficult for companies like us to access the financial and credit markets  and have made it more likely we will have to pursue additional strategic alliances  licensing arrangements or collaborations for our product candidates  including for tnferade 
if we are successful in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  investors will likely experience dilution  or the equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
if we raise funds through the issuance of debt securities  those securities would have rights  preferences  and privileges senior to those of our common stock 
if we seek strategic alliances  licenses  or other alternative arrangements  such as arrangements with collaborative partners or others  we may need to relinquish rights to certain of our existing or future technologies  product candidates  or products we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own  or to license the rights to our technologies  product candidates  or products on terms that are not favorable to us 
the overall status of the economic climate could also result in the terms of any equity offering  debt financing  or alliance  license or other arrangement being even less favorable to us and our stockholders than if the overall economic climate were stronger 
we also will continue to look for government sponsored research collaborations and grants to help offset future anticipated losses from operations  as we expect to continue to rely on government funding for a significant portion of our revenues for the next few years and  to a lesser extent  interest income 
if adequate funds are not available through either the capital markets  strategic alliances  or collaborators  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research  development  clinical programs  manufacturing  or commercialization efforts  effect additional changes to our facilities or personnel  or obtain funds through other arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our existing or future technologies  product candidates  or products on terms not favorable to us 
off balance sheet obligations we had no off balance sheet obligations other than in connection with our operating leases  which are disclosed in the contractual commitments table above  during

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million as follows

cash and cash equivalents million short term investments million our exposure to market risk is confined to cash and cash equivalents  which consist of instruments having original maturities of three months or less  and our short term investment portfolio 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio of investment grade government agency notes and corporate bonds 
the securities in our short term investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale  and are subject to minimal interest rate risk  due to their predominantly short term nature 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure on our investment portfolio 
as of december   all short term investments are scheduled to mature in  while we do not believe an increase in market rates of interest would have any significant negative impact on the realizable value of our investment portfolio  changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flow and results of operations 
we are headquartered in the united states where we conduct our preclinical research activities 
clinical trials are currently conducted in the united states and  to a lesser extent  europe 
clinical sites in other locations outside of the united states are evaluated as needed 
all revenues to date have been received in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
on december   we had an outstanding industrial revenue bond payable of  this bond bears interest at a variable rate based on libor 
during  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate over the life of the bond at percent plus a remarketing fee 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap  excluding accrued interest  was  we also have outstanding loans totaling  at fixed interest rates ranging from percent to percent
