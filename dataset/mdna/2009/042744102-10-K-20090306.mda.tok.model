the dividend rate on the stock was  increasing to in year and later years 
the purchase also included the issuance of stock warrants at of the amount of the investment 
the eesa  the arra  and the related governmental programs include a variety of initiatives that could have a significant impact on the banking industry and on arrow  however  the actual impact that these new laws and programs will have on the financial markets  the financial services industry and arrow cannot be determined at this time 
in addition  various federal bills that would significantly affect banks are introduced in congress and the new york state legislature from time to time 
we cannot estimate the likelihood of any currently proposed banking bills being enacted into law  or the ultimate effect that any such potential legislation  if enacted  would have upon our financial condition or operations

competition we face intense competition in all markets we serve 
traditional competitors are other local commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan institutions and credit unions  as well as local offices of major regional and money center banks 
we also encounter strong competition from the failed government sponsored enterprises fannie mae and freddie mac in the area of mortgage loans 
additionally  non banking financial organizations  such as consumer finance companies  insurance companies  securities firms  money market and mutual funds and credit card companies offer substantive equivalents of the various loan and financial products and transactional accounts that we offer  even though these non banking organizations are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions and capital requirements that apply to us 
under federal banking laws  such non banking fi nancial organizations not only may offer products comparable to those offered by commercial banks  but also may establish or acquire their own commercial banks

risk factors our financial results and the market price of our stock in future periods are subject to risks arising from many factors  including the following please note that the discussions below regarding potential impact on arrow of certain of these factors that may develop in the future are not meant to provide predictions by arrow s management that such factors will develop  but to acknowledge the possible impact that could occur if the factors do develop 
difficult market conditions have adversely affected the financial services industry 
for many financial institutions  dramatic declines in the us housing market over the past year  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment  have negatively impacted the credit performance of real estate related loans and resulted in significant write downs of asset values 
to date  the impact of these adverse market conditions has been less significant on arrow than it has been on many other us financial institutions 
write downs at many of these other institutions  initially of asset backed securities but spreading to other securities and loans  have caused a number of those institutions to seek additional capital  to reduce or eliminate dividends  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern abou t the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers  including to other financial institutions 
generally  in the financial services sector  this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies at many institutions  lack of consumer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity 
although this turmoil has affected arrow and our local markets less than certain other institutions and markets so far  the resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets has already  to some extent  adversely affected our business  financial condition and results of operations 
market developments may continue to affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which may impact our charge offs and provision for credit losses 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on arrow and others in the financial institutions industry 
if economic conditions continue to deteriorate and the us experiences a prolonged nationwide recession  the company s allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable loan losses at the balance sheet date 
our allowance for loan losses is based on our historical loss experience as well as an evaluation of the risks associated with our loan portfolio  including the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic conditions and geographic concentrations within the portfolio and other factors 
for a variety of reasons  including falling home prices nationwide  declining collateral values of used low mileage vehicles and a general deterioration in us credit markets since  the rate of growth in the national economy slowed dramatically in and available data suggests that economic conditions may continue to deteriorate in upcoming periods 
if the economy in our geographic market area  northeastern new york state  should deteriorate or enter into a prolonged state of recession  this may have an additional adverse impact on our loan portfolio 
if the quality of our portfolio should weaken due to this impact  our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses  and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect financial results 
moreover  loan portfolio difficulties often accompany difficulties in other areas of our business  including growth of our business generally  thereby compounding the negative effects on earnings 
if economic conditions worsen and the us financial markets continue to experience difficulties  the company may experience limited access to credit markets 
as discussed under part i  item d liquidity  the company has relationships with various third parties to provide overnight and longer term credit arrangements 
as these third parties themselves have difficulty in accessing their own credit markets then we may  in turn  experience a decrease in our capacity to borrow funds 
if the value of real estate in our market area were to decline materially  a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under collateralized  which might have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition to considering the financial strength and cash flow characteristics of borrowers  we often secure loans with real estate collateral  which in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower 
this real property may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is outstanding 
if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values  our earnings and capital could be adversely affected 
our geographic market area experienced real estate price appreciation in the period but property values in our region have leveled off in and have recently declined  similar to what is being experienced elsewhere in the us furthermore  proposed foreclosure legislation  if enacted  may allow courts to alter the terms of mortgages in foreclosure  resulting in an adverse impact on financial institutions 
if securities prices continue to significantly decline  we likely will experience a continuing reduction in income from fiduciary activities 
a portion of the income we earn from managing assets in our fiduciary capacity is tied to the market value of those assets 
we are subject to the local economies where we operate  and unfavorable economic conditions in these areas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends upon the growth in population  income levels and deposits in our geographic market area 
unpredictable and unfavorable economic conditions unique to our market area may have an adverse effect on the quality of our loan portfolio and financial performance 
as a community bank  we are less able than our larger regional competitors to spread the risk of unfavorable local economic conditions over a larger market area 
moreover  we cannot give any assurances that we will benefit from any unique and favorable economic conditions in our market area  even if they do occur 
the domestic interest rate environment could negatively affect the company s net interest income 
an institution s net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest  including short term and long term rates and the relationship between the two 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  which are beyond our control  including general economic conditions  policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies such as the federal reserve board  and actions taken by foreign central banks 
like all financial institutions  the company s balance sheet is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
volatility in interest rates can also result in the flow of funds away from financial institutions 
see the discussion under changes in net interest income due to rate  on page of this report 
current levels of market volatility are unprecedented 
the market for certain investment securities has become highly volatile or inactive  and may not stabilize or resume in the near future 
this volatility can result in significant fluctuation in the prices of those securities  which could affect the results of our operations 
changes in accounting standards may materially impact the company s financial statements 
from time to time  the financial accounting standards board fasb changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements 
these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  we may be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in changes to previously reported financial statements 
the company s business could suffer if it loses key personnel unexpectedly or fails to provide for an orderly management succession 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to retain our key personnel for the duration of their expected terms of service  and to arrange for an orderly succession of other  equally skilled personnel 
competition for the best people in our business can be intense 
while our board of directors actively reviews succession plans  any sudden change at the senior management level may adversely affect our business 
the company relies on other companies to provide key components of the company s business infrastructure 
third party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections  network access and mutual fund distribution 
these parties are beyond our control  and any problems caused by these third parties  including their not providing us their services or performing such services poorly  could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and conduct our business 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect arrow 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty and other relationships 
arrow has exposure to many different counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds  and other institutional clients 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more financial services institutions  or the financial services industry generally  could lead to market wide liquidity problems and to losses or defaults by arrow or by other institutions and organizations 
many of these transactions expose arrow to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client 
in addition  arrow s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by arrow cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due arrow 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
significant legal or regulatory enforcement actions could subject the company to substantial uninsured liabilities 
from time to time we are subject to claims related to our operations 
these claims and legal actions  including supervisory actions by our regulators  could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs 
to protect ourselves from the cost of these claims  we maintain insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations  but this insurance coverage may not cover all claims against us or may increase substantially in cost 
as a result  we may be exposed to significant uninsured liabilities  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the company faces continuing and growing security risks to its own information base and to information on its customers 
the computer systems and network infrastructure that we use are always vulnerable to unforeseen problems  including theft of confidential customer information identity theft and interruption of service as a result of fire  natural disasters  explosion or general infrastructure failure 
these problems may arise in both our internally developed systems and the systems of our third party service providers 
we constantly assess and attempt to improve our security systems and disaster preparedness  but the risks in these areas are substantially escalating 
the company s stock price may begin to reflect market volatility 
our stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors  including actual or anticipated variations in our operating results  recommendations by securities analysts  significant acquisitions or business combinations  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us  new technology used or services offered by our competitors  news reports relating to trends  concerns and other issues in the financial services industry  and changes in government regulations 
many of these factors that may adversely affect our stock price do not directly pertain to our operating results  including general market fluctuations  industry wide factors and economic and general political conditions and events  including terrorist attacks  economic slowdowns or re cessions  interest rate changes  credit loss trends or currency fluctuations 
we may be adversely affected by government regulation 
we are subject to extensive federal and state banking regulations and supervision 
banking regulations are intended primarily to protect our depositors funds and the federal deposit insurance funds  not the company s shareholders 
regulatory requirements affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in the imposition of limitations on our operations that would adversely impact our operations and could  if capital levels dropped significantly  result in our being required to cease or scale back our operations 
changes in governing law  regulations or regulatory practices could impose additional costs on us or adversely affect our ability to obtain deposits or make loans and thereby hurt o ur revenues and profitability 
there can be no assurance that recently enacted legislation will stabilize the us financial markets 
the eesa  arra and related federal government programs  such as the fdic s tlgp  are intended to stabilize and provide liquidity to the us financial markets 
however  there can be no assurance that the eesa  the arra  the implementing regulations for the essa and arra  the tlgp  or any other governmental program will have a positive impact on the financial markets 
the failure of these laws and programs to stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect arrow s business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit or the trading price of arrow s common stock 
arrow may be adversely affected by the recently enacted legislation and related programs 
the eesa  arra and related programs may adversely affect arrow 
arrow may face increased regulation of our business and increased costs associated with these laws and programs 
programs established by the fdic  whether or not arrow participates  may have an adverse effect on arrow 
for example  participation in the fdic s tlgp will require the payment of additional insurance premiums to the fdic  but arrow may also be required to pay significantly higher fdic premiums caused by fdic actions not involving arrow such as fdic bank receiverships that significantly deplete the insurance funds of the fdic and reduce the ratio of reserves to insured deposits

there are uncertainties inherent in making these estimates and assumptions  which could materially affect our results of operations and financial position 
we consider the following to be critical accounting policies the allowance for loan losses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is sensitive to changes in current economic conditions that may make it difficult for borrowers to meet their contractual obligations 
any downward trend in the economy  regional or national  may require us to increase the allowance for loan losses resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition at the same time that other areas of our operations  including new loan originations and assets under administration in our trust department may also be experiencing negative pressures from the same underlying negative economic conditions 
liabilities for retirement plans we have a variety of pension and retirement plans 
liabilities under these plans rely on estimates of future salary increases  numbers of employees and employee retention  discount rates and long term rates of investment return 
changes in these assumptions due to changes in the financial markets  the economy  our own operations or applicable law and regulation may result in material changes to our liability for postretirement expense  with consequent impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  requires a reduction in the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is  in part  based on an estimate of future taxable income 
goodwill sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
other than temporary decline in the value of debt and equity securities sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  requires that  for individual securities classified as either available for sale or held to maturity  an enterprise shall determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is other than temporary 
for example  if it is probable that the investor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security not impaired at acquisition  an other than temporary impairment shall be considered to have occurred 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security shall be written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down shall be included in current period e arnings 
any significant economic downturn might result  and historically have on occasion resulted  in an other than temporary impairment in securities held in our portfolio 
valuation methods for securities available for sale measured at fair value on a recurring basis we account for securities available for sale in accordance with sfas no 
 with changes to fair value recorded in other comprehensive income 
most of the portfolio  which includes us treasury and agency securities  mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  municipal securities  corporate debt and equity securities are priced using industry standard models that consider various assumptions that include time value  yield curves  volatility factors  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity  current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments  as well as other relevant economic measures 
substantially all of these assumptions are either observable in the marketplace  derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 
municipal and corporate securities are valued using a type of matrix  or grid  pricing in which securities are benchmarked against the treasury rate based on credit rating 
these model and matrix measurements are classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
the following discussion and analysis focuses on and reviews our results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  and our financial condition as of december  and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the selected quarterly and annual information set forth above and the consolidated financial statements and other financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
when necessary  prior year financial information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
a 
overview summary of financial results we reported net income of million for  an increase of million  or  compared to diluted earnings per share of represented an increase of  or  from during  both our net interest margin and net interest income increased due to a combination of falling short term interest rates which has a proportionately larger impact on the cost of our deposits than on our earnings from our assets combined with a market wide return of a positively sloped yield curve which has a proportionately larger impact on our earning assets than on our liabilities 
a increase in average earning assets also had a positive impact on the growth in our net interest income 
unlike many financial institutions  we did not experience significant deterioration in our loan and asset quality during despite the onset of a worldwide economic recession and severe disruption in the financial markets generally 
earnings in all quarters of were higher than the respective quarters  in spite of the worsening economy late in  annual earnings for represented a record high for the company 
financial market turmoil over the past fifteen months  the dow jones industrial average dow jones slid from a high of over  to a low of under  with the most dramatic change occurring during the fourth quarter of the financial markets and particularly the banking sector have felt the impact of losses on subprime mortgages and other credit portfolios and loss of short term liquidity  resulting in the september failure of lehman brothers holdings lehman and the distressed sales of bear stearns and merrill lynch 
in addition  the number of bank failures  while not at historic highs  has risen to levels not seen for several years 
many community banks that were not underwriting subprime residential real estate loans and were not investing significant amounts in private issue collateralized debt obligations  like our company  have not experience d the significant losses in their loan or investment portfolios or the liquidity concerns that many of our larger contemporaries have experienced 
however  the magnitude of turmoil in the markets did have an impact on our operations during and may continue to influence our financial condition and results of operations in forthcoming periods 
decision not to participate in us treasury tarp ccp as previously disclosed in our current report in form k filed with the sec on january   our board of directors determined in late january  after we had applied to the us treasury department and federal bank regulators for participation by the company in the us government s capital purchase plan cpp  an element of the larger troubled assets relief program tarp  and after we had been preliminarily approved by the department of treasury for participation  that we would not proceed ahead and sell shares of our preferred stock to the treasury department but would decline to participate 
the basic reason for the board s decision  as discussed in the form k  was that the company s financial and liquidity positions remained sufficiently strong at year end such that the potential loss of board and management flexibility entailed in cpp participation was deemed too high a cost to warrant participation 
economic recession and loan quality as the economic recession got underway in late  our market area of northeastern new york was relatively sheltered from falling real estate values and increasing unemployment 
as the recession became stronger and deeper in late  even northeastern new york began to feel the impact of the worsening national economy reflected in a slow down in real estate sales and increasing unemployment rates 
by year end  we had experienced a decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio  although by standard measures our portfolio continued to appear stronger than the average for our peer group 
nonperforming loans amounted to million at december   an increase of million from the prior year end 
the ratio of nonperforming loans to period end loans was 
at december   an increase from 
one year earlier 
by way of comparison  this ratio for our peer group increased by basis points from at december  to at december  our loans charged off net of recoveries against our allowance for loan losses were thousand for  as compared to thousand for the prior year 
at year end  the allowance for loan losses was million  representing of total loans  essentially the same as at the prior year end 
to date  we have not experienced significant deterioration in any of our three major loan portfolio segments o commercial loans we lend to small and medium size businesses  which typically do not encounter liquidity problems  since we may often also provide support for their supplementary liquidity needs 
however  current unemployment rates in our region are higher than in the past few years and the number of total jobs has decreased  although these trends are largely attributable to a few changes in the local operations of a small number of larger corporations 
o residential real estate loans we have not experienced a notable increase in our foreclosure rates  primarily due to the fact that we did not originate or participate in underwriting subprime loans 
o indirect automobile loans these loans comprise over of our loan portfolio 
we have not experienced any significant change in our delinquency rate or level of charge offs  although both delinquencies and charge offs did increase moderately in the fourth quarter of investment securities and other than temporary impairment we hold a million par value senior unsecured bond issued by lehman 
on september   lehman declared bankruptcy resulting in a significant decline in the market value of the bond 
we deemed the decline to be other than temporary in the third quarter  and  accordingly  recognized a non cash other than temporary impairment charge to earnings of thousand net of tax a 
reduction in diluted earnings per share 
after further deterioration  we recognized an additional charge to earnings of thousand net of tax a 
reduction in diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of the remaining estimated value of our lehman bond of thousand has been included in non performing assets as of december  the lehman bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing and the ultimate value of our bond is subject to further change 
corporate bonds and other debt securities represented only million  or  of our million investment securities portfolio at december  we did not hold any preferred or common stock of fannie mae or freddie mac 
as of year end  we had not experienced any impairment issues with our holdings of mortgage backed securities or cmo s 
liquidity and access to credit markets we have not experienced any liquidity issues during and through the date of this report 
the terms of our lines of credit with our correspondent banks  the fhlbny and the federal reserve bank  have not changed  except for some increases in the maximum borrowing capacity see our general liquidity discussion on page 
in general  we rely on asset based liquidity ie funds in overnight investments and cash flow from maturing investments and loans with liability based liquidity as a secondary source overnight lending arrangements with our correspondent banks  fhlbny overnight and term advances and the federal reserve bank discount window  as primary sources 
during the recent period of bank failures  some institutions experienced a run on deposits  even though there was no reasonable expectation that depositors would lose any of their insured deposits 
we maintain  and periodically test  a contingent liquidity plan whose purpose is to ensure that we can generate an adequate amount of cash to meet a wide variety of potential liquidity crises 
effect of visa public offering  stock redemption and litigation reserves in december  we recorded a thousand liability for our proportional share  as a member bank of the visa credit card organization  of certain estimated litigation costs incurred by visa usa  inc  as further described in our form k for december  on march   visa inc distributed to member banks  in a mandatory redemption of of its class b shares held by the member banks  some of the proceeds realized by visa from the ipo of its class a shares on march  with another portion of the ipo proceeds  visa established a billion escrow to cover certain  but not all  of its continuing litigation liabilities 
during the first quarter of  we recorded the following transactions a gain of thousand from the mandatory redemption by visa of of our class b visa inc shares  reflected in noninterest income  and a reversal of thousand of the thousand accrual at december  representing our proportional share of visa litigation costs  reflected as a reduction in other operating expense 
accordingly  we have a remaining liability of thousand included as a component of other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   representing our estimate of the fair value of potential losses related to the remaining covered visa litigation 
class b shares which were not redeemed will be converted to class a shares  at a conversion ratio to be determined based on member banks actual liability for litigation expenses  on the later of three years or the settlement of litigation indemnified by member banks 
these remaining class b shares are available to fund future visa litigation liabilities indemnified by the member banks until that time 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and consistent with the securities and exchange commission sec guidance  the company has not recognized any value for its remaining vis a class b shares 
in october  visa announced that it had settled the lawsuit with discover financial services  which was part of the covered litigation for which the visa member banks are contingently liable 
in december  visa deposited an additional billion into the litigation escrow fund  thereby reducing the ratio for the conversion of class b to class a shares and effectively repurchasing approximately of the remaining class b shares held by member banks to fund its settlement of the discover litigation 
the company had not previously recognized the value of the class b shares in accordance with the sec guidance discussed above  nor did the company recognize any income or expense as a result of visa s redemption of its class b shares or settlement of the litigation in the fourth quarter 
the estimation of the company s proportionate share of any potential losses related to certain co vered litigation is extremely difficult and involves a high degree of judgment 
management has determined the remaining thousand liability included in other liabilities on our year end consolidated balance sheet is the fair value of our proportionate share of the remaining covered visa litigation as of december   but this value is subject to change depending upon future developments in the visa litigation 
change in shareholder equity at december   our tangible book value per share calculated based on shareholders equity reduced by intangible assets including goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to  an increase of  or  from year end our total shareholders equity at year end increased over the year end level 
major changes to shareholders equity included i million of net income for the year  ii a million net unrealized gain in securities available for sale  offset by  iii cash dividends of million  iv losses on our pension plan reflected as other comprehensive income of million  and v repurchases of our own common stock of million 
as of the last trading day of  the average of our closing stock price was  resulting in a t rading multiple of to our tangible book value 
we also continue to remain classified as well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
as mentioned above  due to our strong capital  financial and liquidity positions at year end  we did not participate in the us treasury s capital purchase program a component of tarp 
the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of

results of operations the following analysis of net interest income  the provision for loan losses  noninterest income  noninterest expense and income taxes  highlights the factors that had the greatest impact on our results of operations for and the prior two years 
i 
net interest income tax equivalent basis net interest income represents the difference between interest  dividends and fees earned on loans  securities and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds 
changes in net interest income result from changes in the level and mix of earning assets and sources of funds volume and changes in the yields earned and interest rates paid rate 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest income may also be described as the product of average earning assets and the net interest margin

generally  the following items have a major impact on changes in net interest income due to rate general interest rate changes  the ratio of our rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap during periods of interest rate changes  and changes in the level of nonperforming loans 
impact of interest rate changes our profitability is affected by the prevailing interest rate environment  both short term rates and long term rates  by changes in those rates  and by the relationship between short and long term rates ie  the yield curve 
changes in rates in mid  due to actions by the federal reserve bank fed  the target rate on federal funds funds which banks loan to one another on an overnight basis decreased to a then almost unprecedented low of  and rates paid by banks on short term deposits similarly decreased to historically low levels 
the resulting lower rates on credit provoked a substantial expansion of lending across all sectors of the us economy  especially mortgage and consumer lending 
in mid  the fed reversed course and began to increase short term rates with a series of basis point increases in the targeted federal funds rate  reaching by mid rates paid by banks on short term deposits similarly increased during this period  although rates paid on long term deposits and yields earned on long term loans and assets did not increase p roportionately  as lending  particularly mortgage lending  continued to expand nationwide at a rapid rate 
from mid to fall  the fed did not take any actions to change short term rates 
in september  however  in response to a weakening economy and a loss of liquidity in the short term credit market  precipitated in large part by the collapse in the housing market and resulting problems in subprime residential real estate lending  the fed began lowering the federal funds target rate  rapidly and by significant amounts 
by the december meeting of the board of governors  the rate had decreased basis points  to  and throughout  the fed  in response to continuing liquidity concerns in the credit markets  further lowered the targeted federal funds rate by an additional basis points  to an unprecedented low range of to 
we began to see an immediate impact in the reduced cost of our deposits  which we expect will continue but at a more gradual pace as maturing time deposits reprice 
we also expect that our loan and investment securities yields will decline  but that we may not realize a sizable reduction in our cost of deposits  since short term rates are not expected to decrease significantly 
changes in the yield curve an important development with regard to the effect of rate changes on our profitability in the mid to mid period was the flattening of the yield curve  especially during and the first half of after the fed began increasing short term interest rates in june  the yield curve did not maintain its traditional upward slope but flattened  that is  as short term rates increased  longer term rates stayed unchanged or even decreased 
therefore  the traditional spread between short term rates and long term rates the upward yield curve essentially disappeared  ie  the curve flattened 
in late and in early  the yield curve actually inverted  with short term rates exceeding long term rates 
the flattening of the yield curve was the most significant factor in reducing our net intere st income from through at the end of the second quarter of  however  the yield on longer term securities began to increase over short term investments 
this increase in rate spread was further enhanced when long term rates held steady after the fed lowered short term rates in september because market perceptions and expectations are now changing regarding the need to price more risk into long term debt  long term rates may be expected to remain steady  or perhaps even rise  even though short term rates have dropped sharply in recent quarters 
therefore  the yield curve may continue to reflect its more traditional shape for some time 
however  even lending institutions such as ours that have avoided subprime lending problems and have enjoyed continued high credit quality in recent periods may nevertheless experience some increasing pressure on credit quality in recent periods  especially i f the national or regional economy continues to weaken 
any credit or asset quality erosion will reduce or possibly outweigh the benefit we may experience from the return of a positively sloped yield curve 
thus  no assurances can be given on future improvements in our net interest margins  net interest income or net income generally  particularly as consumer mortgage related borrowings diminish across the us economy and the redeployment of funds by bankers from maturing loans and assets into other high quality assets becomes progressively more difficult 
effect of rate changes on our margin  changes in our margins late in addition to the shape of the yield curve  our net interest margin has traditionally been sensitive to and impacted by changes in prevailing market interest rates 
generally  there has been a negative correlation between changes in prevailing interest rates and our net interest margin  especially when rates begin to move in a different direction 
typically  when prevailing rates begin to decline  our net interest margin generally increases in immediately ensuing periods  and vice versa  when prevailing rates being to increase as in each case earning assets reprice more slowly than interest bearing sources of funds 
this was the case for our net interest margin during the to mid period  when prevailing short term market rates began to decline and our margin increased  and duri ng the mid to period  when rates began to increase and our margins experienced a negative effect 
in through mid  however  even as the fed held rates steady  our net interest margin continued to suffer as a result of the flattening yield curve 
our margin reached a low point in the fourth quarter of  at  and then increased slightly to for each of the first two quarters of in the third quarter of the margin decreased once again  to improvement in our margins late since september  our margin has steadily improved  principally due to the fact the rates we paid on our interest bearing liabilities began to reprice downward rapidly 
the dramatic reduction in short term interest rates since september has had a significant positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margins 
in the fourth quarter of  our margin expanded by three basis points  to  and our margin for the first quarter was  an increase of basis points 
the margin increased by another basis points to for the second quarter of  and then held steady at and for the respective third and fourth quarters of we expect that our margin may contract in future periods as volume of repricing in the investment and loan portfolios exceeds the volume of repricing in our deposit and wholesale funding portfolios 
moreover  our ability to reduce the rates paid on some of our non maturity deposit products  even if short term funding rates continue to decline in upcoming periods  is limited due to the already low levels for those products  whereas rates earned on our earning assets will likely index downwards to the full extent of the decrease in prevailing rates 
a discussion of the models we use in projecting the impact on net interest income resulting from possible changes in interest rates vis vis the repricing patterns of our earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is included later in this report under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in net interest income due to volume average balances dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand deposits total assets earning assets to total assets to in general  an increase in average earning assets has a positive impact on net interest income 
for  average earning assets increased million over  while average interest bearing liabilities only increased million 
this combination led to a million increase in net interest income 
this positive effect was in addition to the million positive impact on net interest income resulting from the changes in rates during the year  discussed above 
the million increase in average earning assets from to reflected an increase in average loans of million  or  and an increase of million  or  in investment securities  while the level of overnight funds purchased remained relatively unchanged 
we experienced increases in all major categories within the loan portfolio during  although the average balance of indirect loans which represented the second largest segment of the loan portfolio increased only from indirect loans are primarily auto loans financed through local dealerships where we acquire the dealer paper 
increases in the average balances of our other two large segments were an increase of million  or  in our commercial and commercial real estate loans and an increase of million  or  in our residential real estate loans 
the million increase in average interest bearing liabilities resulted from a million increase in average deposit balances and a million increase in the average balance of other borrowed funds 
the fact that average earning assets grew at a faster pace than average interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to a million  or  increase in the average balance of non interest bearing demand deposits and from retained earnings 
to in general  an increase in average earning assets has a positive impact on net interest income 
for  average earning assets increased million over  while average interest bearing liabilities only increased million 
this combination led to a million increase in net interest income 
this positive effect was partially offset by the thousand negative effect on net interest income resulting from the changes in rates during the year  discussed above 
the million increase in average earning assets from to reflected an increase in average loans of million  or  a decrease of million  or  in investment securities and an increase of million in the average balance of federal funds purchased 
we experienced increases in all major categories within the loan portfolio during  although the average balance of indirect loans which represented the second largest segment of the loan portfolio decreased slightly 
indirect loans are primarily auto loans financed through local dealerships where we acquire the dealer paper 
increases in the average balances of other loan categories included i for commercial and commercial real estate loans  an increase of million  or  ii for residential real estate loans  an increase of million  or  and iii for other consumer loans  an inc rease of million  or 
although average loans increased by in  this was a lower rate of increase than the rate experienced in the million increase in average interest bearing liabilities resulted from a million increase in time deposits and a million increase in non maturity deposit balances 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease of million in the average balance of borrowed funds 
the fact that average earning assets grew at a faster pace than average interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to a million  or  increase in the average balance of non interest bearing demand deposits 
increases in the volume of loans and deposits  as well as yields and costs by type  are discussed later in this report under item c financial condition 
ii 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses we consider our accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy  given the uncertainty involved in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio  and the material effect that such judgments may have on our results of operations 
in addition to the following discussion  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
through the provision for loan losses  an allowance is maintained that reflects our best estimate of probable incurred loan losses related to specifically identified loans and losses for categories of loans in the remaining portfolio 
actual loan losses are charged against this allowance when loans are deemed uncollectible 
we use a two step process to determine the provision for loans losses and the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
we evaluate impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans over  under sfas no 
 accounting for creditors for impairment of a loan 
we evaluate the remainder of the portfolio under sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
at december  we had three loans considered impaired that were evaluated under sfas no 
those loans had sufficient collateral and required no specific reserve 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
homogenous loan pools under our sfas no 
analysis  we group homogeneous loans as follows  each with its own estimated loss rate i unsecured commercial loans  ii secured construction and development loans  iii secured commercial loans non owner occupied  iv secured commercial loans owner occupied  v one to four family residential real estate loans  vi home equity loans  vii indirect loans low risk tiers based on credit scores  viii indirect loans high risk tiers  and ix other consumer loans 
within the group of other commercial and commercial real estate loans  we sub group loans based on our internal system of risk rating  which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate loans 
we establish loss rates for each of these pools 
estimated losses  under our sfas no 
evaluation  reflect consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of december  in our evaluation  we do both a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the homogeneous pools 
quantitative analysis quantitatively  we determine the historical loss rate for each homogeneous loan pool 
during the past five years we have had little charge off activity on loans secured by residential real estate 
indirect consumer lending principally automobile loans represents a significant component of our total loan portfolio and is the only category of loans that has a history of losses that lends itself to a trend analysis 
we have had two losses on commercial real estate loans in the past five years 
losses on commercial loans other than those secured by real estate are also historically low  but can vary widely from year to year  this is the most complex category of loans in our loss analysis 
our net charge offs for the past five years have been at historical lows for our company  although charge offs increased in  particularly in the fourth quarter see the table on page 
annualized net charge offs have ranged from 
to 
of average loans during this period 
in prior years this ratio was significantly higher 
for example  in the mid to late s  the charge off ratio ranged from 
to 
for our company 
the ratio for bank holding companies in our peer group was 
for the years ended december   the most recent reporting period 
the change in this peer group ratio represents a significant increase from the prior five years when the peer ratio ranged from 
to 
qualitative analysis while historical loss experience provides a reasonable starting point for our analysis  historical losses  or even recent trends in losses  do not by themselves form a sufficient basis to determine the appropriate level for the allowance 
therefore  we have also considered and adjusted historical loss factors for qualitative and environmental factors that are likely to cause credit losses associated with our existing portfolio 
these included changes in the volume and severity of past due  nonaccrual and adversely classified loans changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans changes in the value of the underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans changes in lending policies and procedures  including changes in underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses changes in the quality of the loan review system changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff changes in international  national  regional  and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectibility of the portfolio the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing portfolio or pool for each homogeneous loan pool  we estimate a loss factor expressed in basis points for each of the qualitative factors above  and for historical credit losses 
we update and change  if necessary  the loss rates assigned to various pools based on the analysis of loss trends and the change in qualitative and environmental factors 
from june to june  the federal reserve bank increased prevailing short term rates in an effort to slow down national economic growth and check potential increases in the inflation rate 
however  from august through december  the federal reserve bank began to cut rates in response to the growing liquidity crisis in credit markets and evidence of a significant economic recession 
in our market area there was little impact from these developments in credit markets and the national economy on unemployment rates  job growth and business failures until the last quarter of  overall  our market area has not experienced in the past five quarters the degree of negative impact on lending  credit and property values that the us as a whole has experienced  although this may change in upcoming periods 
due to the imprecise nature of the loan loss estimation process and ever changing economic conditions  the risk attributes of our portfolio may not be adequately captured in data related to the formula based loan loss components used to determine allocations in our analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
management  therefore  has established and held an unallocated portion within the allowance for loan losses reflecting the uncertainty of future economic conditions within our market area 
this unallocated portion of the allowance was thousand at december  summary of the allowance and provision for loan losses dollars in thousands loans  net of unearned income years ended december  loans at end of period average loans total assets at end of period nonperforming assets nonaccrual loans commercial real estate commercial loans residential real estate loans consumer loans total nonaccrual loans loans past due or more days and still accruing interest total nonperforming loans repossessed assets other real estate owned nonaccrual investments total nonperforming assets allowance for loan losses balance at beginning of period loans charged off commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate residential installment loans to individuals total loans charged off recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate residential installment loans to individuals total recoveries of loans previously charged off net loans charged off provision for loan losses charged to expense balance at end of period nonperforming asset ratio analysis net loans charged off as a percentage of average loans provision for loan losses as a percentage of average loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans  period end allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans nonperforming loans as a percentage of loans  period end nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets  period end allocation of the allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate residential mortgage indirect and other installment loans to individuals unallocated total iii 
noninterest income the majority of our noninterest income constitutes fee income from services  principally fees and commissions from fiduciary services  deposit account service charges  insurance commissions  computer processing fees and other recurring fee income 
net gains or losses on the sale of securities available for sale is another category of noninterest income 
analysis of noninterest income dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount income from fiduciary activities fees for other services to customers net gains losses on securities transactions other than temporary impairment gain on visa stock redemption gain on the sale of premises insurance commissions other operating income total noninterest income compared to although total noninterest income was relatively unchanged from to there were several significant transactions during  most notably the two items discussed in the overview beginning on page the write down of our lehman bond  and the gain from the visa stock redemption 
for  income from fiduciary activities decreased thousand  or  from the decrease followed the significant decrease in assets under administration and management following the severe decline in the stock markets in the last three months of at year end  the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  from year end by comparison  the dow jones industrial average was  at december  a decrease from  at december  with a significant portion of our fiduciary fees indexed to assets under administration we would normally expect this income to decrease proportionately 
however  since the market decline occurred primarily in the second half of the year our total income from fiduciary activities did n ot fall to the full extent of the decrease in the market value of assets under administration 
income from fiduciary activities includes income from funds under investment management in the north country funds  specifically the north country equity growth fund ncegx and the north country intermediate bond fund ncbdx  both of which are advised by our registered investment adviser subsidiary  north country investment advisers  inc on a combined basis  these funds had a market value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the funds were introduced in march most of the dollars invested in these funds are derived from retirement and pension plan accounts of which our banks serve as trustee  but our north country funds also are offered on a retail basis through an arrangement with uvest financial services group  inc  a third party registered broker dealer that provides securities brokerage services to our customers from several of our bank branches 
our company s pension plan is included as an investor in the north country funds  which owned shares in the funds with a market value of approximately million at december  and million at fees for other services to customers include deposit account service charges  debit card processing fees  merchant bankcard processing fees  safe deposit box fees and loan servicing fees 
these fees amounted to million in  an increase of thousand  or  from the increase was primarily attributable to debit card activity fee income and increases in income from our third party provider of securities brokerage services 
during we recognized a net gain of thousand on the sale of million of investment securities available for sale  whereas no securities were sold during during we sold a building which we were using for storage and for administrative purposes to a developer 
after renovation  we agreed to lease back office space which amounted to less than percent of the total building space 
we recognized a gain of thousand in on this sale 
in november  we acquired capital financial group  inc  a local insurance agency specializing in the sale of group health and life insurance 
see the more detailed discussion of the acquisition on page of this report 
insurance commission income increased from million in to million in other operating income includes net gains on the sale of loans and other real estate owned as well as other miscellaneous revenues 
for  other operating income decreased thousand  or  from in years prior to  other operating income included data processing servicing fee income received from one unaffiliated upstate new york bank 
however  this arrangement came to an end in the second quarter of  following the acquisition of that institution by an unrelated company 
termination of the arrangement resulted in a reduction in fee income of thousand in compared to compared to total noninterest income increased thousand  or  from to for  income from fiduciary activities increased thousand  or  from most of the increase resulted from an increase in assets under administration and management 
at year end  the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from year end fees for other services to customers in included deposit account service charges  debit card processing fees  merchant bankcard processing fees  safe deposit box fees and loan servicing fees 
these fees amounted to million in  an increase of thousand  or  from the increase was primarily attributable to increases in rental income from our third party provider of securities brokerage services and increases in our merchant bankcard and debit card activity fee income 
insurance commission income from our capital financial insurance agency subsidiary was million for  the first full year of income from this business 
the total increased to million in and million in other operating income includes net gains on the sale of loans and other real estate owned as well as other miscellaneous revenues 
for  other operating income decreased thousand  or  from in  we sold  at market price  a parcel of land that we had earlier purchased to serve as premises for a new branch

the efficiency ratio a ratio where lower is better is calculated as the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of tax equivalent net interest income and other income 
excluded from the calculation are intangible asset amortization and any net securities gains or losses 
the efficiency ratio might be considered a non gaap financial measure but is generally utilized by banks and bank analysts to assess an institution s performance

investment portfolio investment securities are classified as held to maturity  trading  or available for sale  depending on the purposes for which such securities were acquired and are being held 
securities held to maturity are debt securities that the company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity  such securities are stated at amortized cost 
debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of sale in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
debt and equity securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported net of taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss

loan portfolio the amounts and respective percentages of loans outstanding represented by each principal category on the dates indicated were as follows a 
types of loans dollars in thousands december  amount amount amount amount amount commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate construction real estate residential indirect and other installment loans to individuals total loans allowance for loan losses total loans  net maintenance of high quality in the loan portfolio during the second half of and throughout  the us experienced significant disruption and volatility in its financial and capital markets 
a major cause of the disruption was a significant decline in residential real estate values across much of the us  which in turn triggered widespread defaults on subprime mortgage loans and steep devaluations of portfolios containing these loans and securities collateralized by them 
in recent months  as real estate values have continued to fall in most areas of the us  problems have spread from subprime loans to better quality mortgage portfolios  and in some cases prime mortgage loans  as well as home equity and credit card loans 
recently  commercial real estate values have begun to decline substantially and commercial real estate mortgage portfolios have begu n to experience the same problems that have beset residential mortgage portfolios over the prior months 
many lending institutions have suffered sizable charge offs and losses in their loan and investment securities portfolios in the past six quarters as a result of their origination or investment in these kinds of loans or securities 
through december  we have not experienced a significant deterioration in our loan or investment portfolios  except for the impaired lehman bond cited earlier in this report 
we have never engaged in subprime mortgage lending as a business line and we do not extend or purchase any so called alt a  negative amortization  option arm  or negative equity mortgage loans 
on occasion we have made loans to borrowers having a fico score of or below or have had extensions of credit outstanding to borrowers who have developed credit problems after origination resulting in deterioration of their fico scores 
we also on occasion have extended community development loans to borrowers whose creditworthiness is below our normal standards as part of the community support program we have developed in fulfillment of our statutorily mandated duty to support low and moderate income borrower within our service area 
however  we are a prime lender and apply prime lending standards and this  together with the fact that the service area in which we make most of our loans has not experienced as severe a decline in property values as other parts of the us  are the principal reasons that we have not to date experienced significant deterioration in our loan portfolio 
if  however  the current downturn in the us real estate markets should continue and the us and or our local economy should continue to weaken substantially  we can give no assurances about the continuing high quality of our loan portfolio 
in such an event we may experience elevated charge offs  higher provisions to our loan loss reserve  and increasing expense related to asset maintenance and supervision 
residential real estate loans in recent years  residential real estate and home equity loans have represented the largest segment of our loan portfolio 
residential mortgage demand has been moderate since  after a several year period when demand was high 
however  during and and the first quarter of  we sold many of our year  fixed rate mortgage originations  while retaining the servicing rights 
by the end of the first quarter of  as yields on longer term residential real estate loans began to rise  we stopped selling our year mortgage originations and decided to retain them in our portfolio 
however  during the last quarter of  as the government support entities gses fannie mae and freddie mac began to dominate the stressed home mortgage market and to offer lower rate mortgages that the non gsi market was hard press ed to match  we began to sell most of our originations to freddie mac 
during  the million of our new residential real estate loan originations offset normal principal amortization  prepayments on pre existing loans and fourth quarter sales of newly originated loans 
if we continue in the current gse subsidized low rate environment for newly originated residential real estate loans  we may experience a decrease in our outstanding balances in this segment of our portfolio 
moreover  if our local economy or real estate market suffers a major downturn  the demand for residential real estate loans in our service area may decrease  which also may negatively impact our real estate portfolio and our financial performance 
indirect loans in the early years of the current decade  indirect consumer loans consisting principally of auto loans financed through local dealerships where we acquire the dealer paper was the largest segment of our loan portfolio 
for much of this period  indirect consumer loans were the fastest growing segment of our loan portfolio  both in terms of absolute dollar amount and as a percentage of the overall portfolio 
since  however  this segment of the portfolio has fluctuated in size  with periods of expansion followed by contraction 
generally  over the period the segment experienced little growth in absolute terms and decreased as a percentage of the overall portfolio 
this change in indirect loan totals was largely the result of aggressive campaigns of zero rate and other subsidized financing by auto manufacturers  commencing late and recurri ng periodically in the years since then 
at the end of the first quarter of  we experienced an increase in indirect loans  which continued throughout the second and third quarters of  for a variety of factors  including the decision by the automobile manufacturers to be less aggressive with their subsidized financing programs 
in the fourth quarter of  however  indirect loan balances declined by  measured at quarter end although the average balance for the fourth quarter was slightly higher than the average balance for the third quarter 
in the last quarter of and the first two quarters of  we encountered enhanced rate competition on indirect auto loans from other lenders  including finance affiliates of the auto manufacturers who increased their offerings of heavily subsidized  low or zero rate loans 
this increasingly competitive environment  combined with softening demand for vehicles  especially for suvs and light trucks  had a negative effect on our indirect originations  and we experienced decreases in indirect balances in the first two quarters of however during the last two quarters of  as some of the major lenders in the indirect market pulled back  including the auto companies financing affiliates  our share of the indirect loan market increased and our portfolio at december  exceeded the balance at december  by million  or 
originations of indirect loans for were approximately million 
at december   indirect loans represented the second largest category of loans in our portfolio and a significant component of our business 
however  if the recent dramatic reduction in auto demand continues  our indirect loan portfolio is likely to experience limited  if any  overall growth  either in real terms or as a percentage of the total portfolio  regardless of whether the auto company affiliates resume their offering of highly subsidized vehicle loans 
such weakened demand for indirect loans could negatively impact our financial performance 
commercial  commercial real estate and construction and land development loans we have experienced moderate to strong demand for commercial loans for the past several years  and thus commercial and commercial real estate loan balances have grown significantly  both in dollar amount and as a percentage of the overall loan portfolio 
this pattern continued during as the outstanding balance in this category grew million  or  from year end on originations of approximately million 
substantially all commercial and commercial real estate loans in our portfolio are extended to businesses or borrowers located in our regional market 
many of the loans in the commercial portfolio have variable rates tied to prime  fhlbny or us treasury indices 
we have not experienced any significant weakening in our commercial loan portfolio in recent quarte rs  although in the last few months on a national scale  the commercial real estate market has recently begun to give signs of substantial weakness 
it is entirely possible that we may experience a reduction in the demand for such loans and or a weakening in the quality of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio in upcoming periods 
the following table indicates the changing mix in our loan portfolio by including the quarterly average balances for our significant loan products for the past five quarters 
the remaining quarter by quarter tables present the percentage of total loans represented by each category and the annualized tax equivalent yield of each category

however  these same loan balances are reported as real estate residential in the table of period end balances on page  captioned types of loans 
in general  the yield tax equivalent interest income divided by average loans on our loan portfolio and other earning assets is ultimately impacted by changes in prevailing interest rates  as previously discussed on in this report on page under the heading impact of interest rate changes we expect that loan yields will continue to rise and fall with changes in prevailing market rates  although the timing and degree of responsiveness will be influenced by a variety of other factors  including the makeup of the loan portfolio  the shape of the yield curve  consumer expectations and preferences and the rate at which the portfolio expands 
additionally  there is a significant amount of cash flow from normal amortization and prepayments in all loan categories  and this cash flow reprices at current rates as new loans are generated at the current yields 
as noted in the earlier discussion  during a period of change in prevailing rates  we generally experience a time lag between the impact of the change on our deposit portfolio which is felt relatively quickly and the impact of the change on our loan portfolio which occurs more slowly 
the consequence of this time lag is a positive impact on the net interest margin during the beginning of a rate decline period  and a negative impact on the margin at the beginning of a rate increase period 
as we discussed in our review of net interest income above  during the period from mid to mid  the federal reserve bank increased the targeted federal funds rate from to  in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures and unrestrained borrowing 
during this period of rate increase  the time lag between repricing of our deposits and the repricing of loan balances was especially lengthy  in some sectors of the portfolio  the upward repricing of loan rates never occurred  at least not before the fed reversed course and began decreasing rates in the last four months of and all of the following table indicates the respective maturities and interest rate structure of our commercial  financial and agricultural loans and real estate construction loans at december  for purposes of determining relevant maturities  loans are assumed to mature at but not before their scheduled repayment dates as required by contractual terms 
demand loans and overdrafts are included in the within year maturity category

in addition to these instruments  we also have issued lines of credit to customers  including home equity lines of credit  commitments for residential and commercial construction loans and other personal and commercial lines of credit  which also may be unfunded or only partially funded from time to time 
commercial lines  generally issued for a period of one year  are usually extended to provide for the working capital requirements of the borrower 
at december   we had outstanding unfunded loan commitments in the aggregate amount of approximate ly million

risk elements nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans the amounts of nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans for the past five years are presented in the table on page under the heading summary of the allowance and provision for loan losses 
we designate loans as nonaccrual when the payment of interest and or principal is due and unpaid for a designated period generally days or when the likelihood of the full repayment of principal and interest is  in the opinion of management  uncertain 
under the uniform retail credit classification and account management policy established by banking regulators  fixed maturity consumer loans must generally be charged off no later than when days past due 
loans secured with non real estate collateral in the process of collection are charged down to the value of the collateral  less cost to sell 
open end credits  residential real estate loans and commercial loans are evaluated for charge off on a loan by loan basis when placed on nonaccrual status 
we had no material commitments to lend additional funds on outstanding nonaccrual loans at december  loans past due days or more and still accruing interest are those loans which were contractually past due days or more but because of expected repayments  were still accruing interest 
the balance of loans days past due totaled million at december  and represented of loans outstanding at that date  as compared to approximately million  or of loans at december  these non current loans at december  were composed of approximately million of consumer loans  principally indirect motor vehicle loans  million of residential real estate loans and million of commercial loans 
sfas no 
requires that all impaired loans  except for large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  be measured based on i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  ii the loan s observable market price or iii the fair value of the collateral  less cost to sell  if the loan is collateral dependent 
we apply the provisions of sfas no 
to all impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans over thousand  and to all restructured loans 
allowances for losses for the remaining smaller balance loans are evaluated under sfas no 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we determine impairment for collateralized loans based on fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell 
for other loans  impairment is determined by comparing the recorded value of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
we determine the interest income recognition method for impaired loans on a loan by loan basis 
based upon the borrowers payment histories and cash flow projections  interest recognition methods include full accrual or cash basis

potential problem loans on at least a quarterly basis  we apply an internal credit quality rating system to commercial loans that are either past due or fully performing but exhibit certain characteristics that could reflect a potential weakness 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the likely amount of future principal and interest payments are expected to be less than the contractual amounts  even if such loans are not days past due 
periodically we review the loan portfolio for evidence of potential problem loans 
potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms  but where known information about possible credit problems of the borrower causes doubt about the ability of the borrower to comply with the loan payment terms and may result in disclosure of such loans as nonperforming at some time in the future 
through our on going credit monitoring  we consider loans which  in our internal classification system  are classified as substandard but continue to accrue interest to be potential problem loans 
at december   we identified commercial relationships totaling million as potential problem loans 
at december   we identified commercial relationships totaling million as potential problem loans 
factors such as payment history  value of supporting collateral  and personal or government guarantees led us to conclude that the current risk exposure on these loans did not warrant accounting for the loans as nonperforming 
although in a performing status as of year end  these loans exhibited certain risk factors  which have the potential to cause them to become nonperforming at some point in the future 
the overall level of our performing loans that demonstrate characteristics of potential weakness from time to time is for the most part dependent on economic conditions in northeastern new york state  which in turn are impacted at least in part by economic conditions in the us generally

during  average deposit balances increased by million  or  over the average for the increase was generated from our branch network  including a new branch in plattsburgh in the beginning of and another in the saratoga springs area in april of we did not sell or close any branches during the covered period  the following table presents the quarterly average balance by deposit type for each of the most recent five quarters 
deposit portfolio quarterly average deposit balances dollars in thousands quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits fluctuations in balances of our now accounts and time deposits of  or more are largely the result of municipal deposit fluctuations 
municipal deposits on average represent to of our total deposits 
municipal deposits are typically placed in now accounts and time deposits of short duration 
many of our municipal deposit relationships are subject to annual renewal  by formal or informal agreements 
in general  there is a seasonal pattern to municipal deposits starting with a low point during july and august 
account balances tend to increase throughout the fall and into the winter months from tax deposits and receive an additional boost at the end of march from the electronic deposit of state funds 
in addition to these seasonal fluctuations within types of accounts  the overall level of municipal deposit balances fluctuates from year to year as some municipalities move their accounts in and out of our banks due to competitive factors 
often  the balances of municipal deposits at the end of a quarter are not representative of the average balances for that quarter 
for a variety of reasons  including the seasonality of municipal deposits  we typically experience little net growth or a small contraction in average deposit balances in the first quarter of each calendar year  versus significant growth in the second quarter 
deposit balances followed this pattern for the first two quarters of as the average balance decreased million  or  in the first quarter of  from the fourth quarter of  while the average deposit balance for the second quarter of increased million  or  from the first quarter of during the third quarter of  the average balance of our municipal deposits decreased by million  but this decrease was more than offset by a million increase in the average balance of our non municipal accounts 
during the fourth quarter of  average deposit balances increased by millio n  nearly all of which was attributable to a seasonal increase in municipal balances 
we typically experience a shift within the mix of deposit categories during periods of significant interest rate increases or decreases 
during periods of falling rates  like the period from mid through the end of  depositors tend to transfer maturing time deposits to nonmaturity interest bearing deposit products 
this has been the case for the past four quarters 
at december  time deposits represented of total deposits  down from at december  this compares to recent historical lows and highs of at june  and at june  we expect this shift from time deposits to nonmaturity deposit products to continue if rates remain at their current low levels 
the total quarterly average balances as a percentage of total deposits are illustrated in the table below 
percentage of total quarterly average deposits quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits time deposits of  or more are to a large extent comprised of municipal deposits and are obtained on a competitive bid basis 
quarterly cost of deposits quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits including non interest bearing in general  rates paid by us on various types of deposit accounts are influenced by the rates being offered or paid by our competitors  which in turn are influenced by prevailing interest rates in the economy as impacted from time to time by the actions of the federal reserve bank 
there typically is a time lag between the federal reserve s actions undertaken to influence rates and the actual repricing of our deposit liabilities  although this lag is normally shorter than the lag between federal reserve actions and the repricing of our loans and other earning assets 
as demonstrated in the table above  we experienced a steady decrease in the cost of our deposits in each of the past quarters during the period of falling interest rates from mid through the end of although maturing time deposits will reprice at lower rates in forthcoming periods  most of our nonmaturity deposit products have already been reduced to or nearly to the lowest sustainable levels 
we do not use brokered deposits as a regular funding source and there were not any such balances carried during  or v

liquidity our liquidity is measured by our ability to raise cash when we need it at a reasonable cost 
we must be capable of meeting expected and unexpected obligations to our customers at any time 
given the uncertain nature of customer demands as well as the need to maximize earnings  we must have available reasonably priced sources of funds  on and off balance sheet  that can be accessed quickly in time of need 
overnight investments in federal funds sold  interest bearing bank balances at the federal reserve bank in addition to cash flow from investment securities and loans  both from normal repayment cash flows and the ability to quickly pledge marketable investment securities and loans to obtain funds  represent our primary sources of available liquidity 
certain investment securities are selected at purchase as available for sale based on their marketability and collateral value  as well as their yield and maturity 
our securities available for sale portfolio was million at year end due to the volatility in market values  we are not able to assume that large quantities of such securities could be sold at short notice at their carrying value to provide needed liquidity 
but  if market conditions are favorable resulting in unrealized gains in the available for sale portfolio  we may pursue modest sales of such securities conducted in an orderly fashion to provide needed liquidity 
in addition to liquidity from short term investments  investment securities and loans  we have supplemented available liquidity with additional off balance sheet sources such as federal funds lines of credit and credit lines with the federal home loan bank of new york fhlbny 
we have established federal funds lines of credit with three correspondent banks totaling million 
the average balance throughout was only thousand and there was no period end balance 
we have established overnight and day term lines of credit with the fhlbny  each of these lines provided for a maximum borrowing line of million at december  we borrowed only occasionally from the overnight line of credit with the fhlbny during the average balance throughout was million and there was no period end balance 
if advanced  su ch lines of credit are collateralized by mortgage backed securities  loans and fhlbny stock 
the balance in other short term borrowings at december  consisted entirely of treasury  tax and loan balances at the federal reserve bank of new york 
in addition  we have identified brokered certificates of deposit as an appropriate off balance sheet source of funding accessible in a relatively short time period 
also  glens falls national has established a borrowing facility with the federal reserve bank of new york  pledging certain consumer loans as collateral for potential discount window advances 
at december   the amount available under this facility was million  but there were no advances then outstanding 
we measure and monitor our basic liquidity as a ratio of liquid assets to short term liabilities  both with and without the availability of borrowing arrangements 
based on the level of overnight funds investments  available liquidity from our investment securities portfolio  cash flow from our loan portfolio  our stable core deposit base and our significant borrowing capacity  we believe that our liquidity is sufficient to meet any reasonably likely events or occurrences 
during the past several quarters  the financial markets have been challenging for many financial institutions 
as a result of these market conditions  liquidity premiums have widened and many banks have experienced certain liquidity constraints  substantially increased pricing to retain deposit balances or utilized the federal reserve system discount window to secure adequate funding 
because of arrow s favorable credit quality and strong balance sheet  arrow has not experienced any significant liquidity constraints through the end of during the past several quarters  arrow s liquidity position has been strong  as depositors and investors in the wholesale funding markets seek strong financial institutions

capital resources and dividends shareholders equity was million at december   an increase of million  or  from the prior year end 
the most significant positive changes to shareholders equity included a net income of million and b net unrealized gains in the valuation allowance for available for sale securities million  net of tax which were only partially offset by i cash dividends million  ii a net retirement plan loss reflected as a component of other comprehensive loss million iii purchases of our own common stock million and  iv our guarantee of a million loan to our employee stock ownership plan esop which requires a reduction in shareholders equity for the shares acquired with loan proceeds that have not yet been allocated to employees 
in each of and  we enhanced our regulatory capital by issuing million of capital securities in private placements with institutional investors  utilizing a subsidiary delaware business trust for that purpose 
these trust preferred securities were reflected as junior subordinated obligations issued to unconsolidated subsidiary trusts on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and these securities have certain features that make them an attractive funding vehicle 
under the federal reserve s regulatory capital guidelines discussed below  trust preferred securities may qualify as tier capital  in an amount not to exceed of tier capital  net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
both of our issues of trust preferred securities qualify in their entirety as tier regulatory capital 
the maintenance of appropriate capital levels is a management priority 
overall capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by management and reviewed regularly by the board of directors 
our principal capital planning goal is to provide an adequate return to shareholders while retaining a sufficient base to provide for future expansion and comply with all regulatory standards 
our continuing strong capital base and financial condition were key factors in our decision in january of  to decline a capital investment by the us treasury under their cpp see page 
one set of regulatory capital guidelines applicable to our holding company and subsidiary banks are the so called risk based capital measures 
under these measures  as established by federal bank regulators  the minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets is and the minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 
for arrow  tier capital is comprised of common shareholders equity and the trust preferred securities issued by our two unconsolidated subsidiaries see the second previous paragraph  less intangible assets 
total capital for the risk based capital guidelines includes tier capital plus other qualifying regulatory capital  including a portion of our allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the risk based capital measures  the federal bank regulatory agencies require banks and bank holding companies to satisfy another capital guideline  the tier leverage ratio tier capital to quarterly average assets less intangible assets 
the minimum tier leverage ratio is for the most highly rated institutions 
the guidelines provide that other institutions should maintain a tier leverage ratio that is at least to higher than the minimum level for top rated institutions 
the table below sets forth the capital ratios of our holding company and subsidiary banks  glens falls national and saratoga national  as of december  capital ratios arrow gfnb snb risk based tier ratio total risk based capital ratio tier leverage ratio at december  our holding company and both banks exceeded the minimum capital ratios established by the regulatory guidelines  and qualified as well capitalized  the highest category  in the capital classification scheme set by federal bank regulatory agencies see the further discussion under supervision and regulation in part i item c of this report 
the source of funds for the payment of shareholder dividends by our holding company consists primarily of dividends declared and paid to the holding company by our bank subsidiaries 
in addition to regulatory constrictions on payments of dividends  there are statutory limitations applicable to the payment of dividends by our bank subsidiaries 
as of december   under this statutory limitation  the maximum amount that could have been paid by the bank subsidiaries to the holding company  without special regulatory approval  was approximately million 
the ability of our holding company and our banks to pay dividends in the future is and will continue to be influenced by regulatory policies  capital guidelines and applicable laws

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  we may engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions may be used by us for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions may be used to help manage credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk or to optimize capital 
customer transactions may be used to manage customers requests for funding 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity or capital expenditures

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to credit risk in our loan portfolio and liquidity risk  discussed earlier  our business activities also generate market risk 
market risk is the possibility that changes in future market rates interest rates or prices fees for products and services will make our position less valuable 
the ongoing monitoring and management of interest rate and market risk is an important component of our asset liability management process  which is governed by policies that are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability oversight and control to management s asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting our asset liability profile based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market inte rest rate levels and trends 
we have not made use of derivatives  such as interest rate swaps  in our risk management process 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us 
interest rate risk is the exposure of our net interest income to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is directly related to the different maturities and repricing characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities  as well as to the risk of prepayment of loans and early withdrawal of time deposits  and the fact that the speed and magnitude of responses to interest rate changes varies by product 
the alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model attempts to capture the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest sensitive assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth and a basis point upward and a basis point downward shift in interest rates  and a repricing of interest bearing assets and liabilities at their earliest reasonably predictable repricing date 
we normally apply a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period 
however  at year end the targeted federal funds rate was a range of to 
for the decreasing rate simulation we applied a basis point downward shift in interest rates for the long end of the yield curve with short term rate decreases limited at zero 
applying the simulation model analysis as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates demonstrated a increase in net interest income  and a basis point decrease in interest rates demonstrated a decrease in net interest income 
these amounts were well within our alco policy limits 
historically there has existed an inverse relationship between changes in prevailing rates and our net interest income  reflecting the fact that our liabilities and sources of funds generally reprice more quickly than our earning assets 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast on our part and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
as noted elsewhere in this report  the federal reserve board took certain actions from september through december that resulted in a basis point decrease in prevailing rates 
we believe that decreases in prevailing interest rates will generally have a short term positive impact on our net interest margin and net interest income  which would be mitigated or perhaps reversed over the mid to longer term 
we believe that increases in prevailing rates will generally have a negative impact on our margin and net interest income in the short term  which would be mitigated or perhaps reversed over the long term 
in each case  that is  in the case of increasing or decreasing rates  the slope of the yield curve and ch anges in the slope of the yield curve will also affect net interest income and the net interest margin 
we are not able to predict with certainty what the magnitude of these effects would be 
the hypothetical estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of changes in interest rates including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  unanticipated shifts in the yield curve and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
