regulatory matters overview unitil energy  fitchburg  and northern utilities unitil s distribution utilities deliver electricity and or natural gas to customers in the company s service territory  at rates established under traditional cost of service regulation 
under this regulatory structure  unitil energy  fitchburg  and northern utilities recover the cost of providing distribution service to their customers based on a representative test year  in addition to earning a return on their capital investment in utility assets 
as a result of a restructuring of the utility industry in new hampshire  massachusetts and maine  most unitil customers have the opportunity to purchase their electric or natural gas supplies from third party suppliers 
for northern utilities  only business customers have the opportunity to purchase their natural gas supplies from third party suppliers at this time 
most small and medium sized customers  however  continue to purchase such supplies through unitil energy  fitchburg and northern utilities as the providers of basic or default service energy supply 
unitil energy  fitchburg and northern utilities purchase electricity or natural gas for basic or default service from unaffiliated wholesale suppliers and recover the actual costs of these supplies  without profit or markup  through reconciling  pass through rate mechanisms that are periodically adjusted 
in connection with the implementation of retail choice  unitil power and fitchburg divested their long term power supply contracts through the sale of the entitlements to the electricity sold under those contracts 
unitil energy and fitchburg recover in their rates all the costs associated with the divestiture of their power supply portfolios and have secured regulatory approval from the nhpuc and mdpu  respectively  for the recovery of power supply related stranded costs and other restructuring related regulatory assets 
the remaining balance of these assets  to be recovered principally over the next two to four years  is million as of december  including million in accrued revenue on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
unitil s distribution companies have a continuing obligation to submit filings in both states that demonstrate their compliance with regulatory mandates and provide for timely recovery of costs in accordance with their approved restructuring plans 
see note for additional information on these filings 
unitil energy on january   the nhpuc issued an order in its investigation into implementation of the federal energy policy act of regarding the adoption of standards for time based metering and interconnection 
the nhpuc determined that it is appropriate to implement some form of time based metering standards and ordered that the details  including cost benefit analyses  form of rate design  time of implementation and applicable customer classes are to be determined in separate proceedings initiated by the nhpuc 
the nhpuc also found that additional review of the energy standards for net metering  fuel diversity and fossil fuel generation efficiency as proposed in the energy policy act of is not required due to action of the new hampshire legislature and the nhpuc in adopting comparable standards 
on may   the nhpuc issued an order opening an investigation into the merits of instituting appropriate rate mechanisms  such as revenue decoupling  which would have the effect of removing obstacles to  and encouraging investment in  energy efficiency 
on january   the nhpuc issued its decision in this matter  concluding that such rate mechanisms should only be implemented on a company by company basis in the context of an examination of company specific costs and revenues  service territory  customer mix and rate base investment 
in july  the state of new hampshire enacted legislation that allows electric utilities to make investments in distributed energy resources  including energy efficiency and demand reduction technologies  as well as clean cogeneration and renewable generation

each electric distribution company has been ordered to file a report detailing its response to the storm and outages  and its service restoration efforts with the mdpu by february  public hearings have been held in each of the electric distribution utilities service areas in massachusetts 
based on its preliminary assessment  the company has accrued and deferred approximately million in costs for the repair and replacement of electric distribution systems damaged during the storm 
the amount and timing of the cost recovery of these storm restoration expenditures will be determined in future regulatory proceedings 
the company does not believe these storm restoration expenditures and the timing of cost recovery will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
this matter remains pending 
fitchburg gas operations fitchburg provides natural gas delivery service to its customers on a firm or interruptible basis under unbundled distribution rates approved by the mdpu

fitchburg collects its natural gas supply costs through a seasonal reconciling cost of gas adjustment clause and recovers other related costs through a reconciling local distribution adjustment clause 
fitchburg other on june   the mdpu opened an inquiry into revenue decoupling for gas and electric distribution utilities  generally defined as a ratemaking mechanism designed to eliminate or reduce the dependence of a utility s distribution revenues on sales 
revenue decoupling is intended to remove the disincentive a utility has to promote efforts to reduce energy consumption by its customers or to facilitate installation of distributed generation to displace electricity delivered by the utility 
on july   the mdpu issued an order establishing a comprehensive plan for decoupling to be adopted by gas and electric distribution utilities on a going forward basis  including company specific rate cases 
lost base revenue recovery associated with incremental energy efficiency savings will be allowed through consistent with the mdpu s expectation that  with limited exceptions  distribution companies will be operating under decoupling plans by year end each distribution company was required to notify the mdpu of when the company expects to file a rate case to implement decoupling 
fitchburg notified the mdpu that it will be prepared to file rate cases for each of its divisions by the third quarter of  based upon a calendar test year  along with a comprehensive decoupling proposal and associated base rate adjustment mechanism

northern utilities nh winter cost of gas on october   the nhpuc issued order no 
 concerning the winter cost of gas proceeding for northern utilities new hampshire division 
in that order  the nhpuc noted that northern utilities had identified an unusually high level of lost and unaccounted for gas uafg  and ordered northern utilities to file a detailed report concerning its investigation of this matter 
through its investigation  northern utilities determined that the unaccounted for gas affected both its new hampshire and maine divisions  and that the cause appeared to be incorrect metering at the maritimes northeast m ne portland natural gas transmission system s pngts newington gate station caused by an erroneous meter module change 
the metering equipment was operated and maintained by a third party  spectra energy  the parent company of m ne 
pngts and m ne share joint ownership of the section of the pipeline connected to granite state at the newington gate station 
the error caused granite state to be billed for  dth of natural gas  with granite state then billing northern utilities for an equivalent amount  although the volumes of gas were not actually consumed 
the meter error was corrected and northern utilities  granite state  spectra energy and pngts reached an agreement whereby pngts will provide to northern utilities  through granite state  gas volumes equal to the misread amounts to correct for the error  over a period of approximately months 
both the nhpuc and the mpuc have approved this arrangement  as well as northern utilities methodology for allocating the gas received to its maine and new hampshire divisions based upon the actual gas use over the period the meters were misread

critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in making those estimates and assumptions  the company is sometimes required to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about the impact of matters that are inherently uncertain and for which different estimates that could reasonably have been used could have resulted in material differences in its financial statements 
if actual results were to differ significantly from those estimates  assumptions and judgment  the financial position of the company could be materially affected and the results of operations of the company could be materially different than reported 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting policies  which are defined as those policies where judgments or uncertainties could materially affect the application of those policies 
for a complete discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to the financial statements and note summary of significant accounting policies 
regulatory accounting the company s principal business is the distribution of electricity and natural gas by the three distribution utilities unitil energy  fitchburg and northern utilities 
unitil energy and fitchburg are subject to regulation by the ferc 
fitchburg is also regulated by the mdpu  unitil energy is regulated by the nhpuc and northern utilities is regulated by the mpuc and nhpuc 
granite state  the company s natural gas transmission pipeline  is regulated by the ferc 
accordingly  the company uses the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
sfas no 

in accordance with sfas no 
 the company has recorded regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities which will be recovered from customers  or applied for customer benefit  in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission 

table of contents sfas no 
specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise 
revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred 
if regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future  these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under sfas no 
if revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future  these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under sfas no 
the company s principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed on the company s consolidated balance sheet and a summary of the company s regulatory assets is provided in note thereto 
the company receives a return on investment on its regulated assets for which a cash outflow has been made 
regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs  which can have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company believes it is probable that its regulated distribution and transmission utilities will recover their investments in long lived assets  including regulatory assets 
if the company  or a portion of its assets or operations  were to cease meeting the criteria for application of these accounting rules  accounting standards for businesses in general would become applicable and immediate recognition of any previously deferred costs  or a portion of deferred costs  would be required in the year in which the criteria are no longer met  if such deferred costs were not recoverable in the portion of the business that continues to meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
if unable to continue to apply the provisions of sfas no 
 the company would be required to apply the provisions of fasb statement no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of financial accounting standards board statement no 
in the company s opinion  its regulated operations will be subject to sfas no 
for the foreseeable future 
utility revenue recognition regulated utility revenues are based on rates and charges approved by federal and state regulatory commissions 
revenues related to the sale of electric and gas service are recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each calendar month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated 
this unbilled revenue is estimated each month based on estimated customer usage by class and applicable customer rates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company recognizes a provision for doubtful accounts each month based upon the company s experience in collecting electric and gas utility service accounts receivable in prior years 
at the end of each month  an analysis of the delinquent receivables is performed which takes into account an assumption about the cash recovery of delinquent receivables 
the analysis also calculates the amount of written off receivables that are recoverable through regulatory rate reconciling mechanisms 
the company s distribution utilities are authorized by regulators to recover the costs of their energy commodity portion of bad debts through rate mechanisms 
evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires judgment about the assumptions used in the analysis  including expected fuel assistance payments from governmental authorities and the level of customers enrolling in payment plans with the company 
it has been the company s experience that the assumptions it has used in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts have proven to be reasonably accurate 
retirement benefit obligations the company sponsors the unitil corporation retirement plan pension plan  which is a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its employees 
the company also sponsors an unfunded retirement plan  the unitil corporation supplemental executive retirement plan serp  covering certain executives of the company and an employee k savings plan 
additionally  the company sponsors the unitil employee health and welfare benefits plan pbop plan  primarily to provide health care and life insurance benefits to retired employees 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  sfas no 
 an amendment of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of 
table of contents defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  sfas no

r  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
sfas no 
requires companies to record on their balance sheets as an asset or liability the overfunded or underfunded status of their retirement benefit obligations rbo based on the projected benefit obligation 
the company has recognized a corresponding regulatory asset  to recognize the future collection of these obligations in electric and gas rates 
the company s reported costs of providing retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
the company has made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions  including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets  future compensation  health care cost trends  and appropriate discount rates 
the company s rbo are affected by actual employee demographics  the level of contributions made to the plans  earnings on plan assets  and health care cost trends 
changes made to the provisions of these plans may also affect current and future costs 
the company s rbo may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including  anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the company s rbo 
if these assumptions were changed  the resultant change in benefit obligations  fair values of plan assets  funded status and net periodic benefit costs could have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
the discount rate assumptions used in determining retirement plan costs and retirement plan obligations are based on a market average of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
for the years ended december  and  a change in the discount rate of would have resulted in an increase or decrease of approximately  in the net periodic benefit cost for the pension plan 
for the years ended december  and  a increase in the assumption of health care cost trend rates would have resulted in increases in the net periodic benefit cost for the pbop plan of  and  respectively 
similarly  a decrease in the assumption of health care cost trend rates for those same time periods would have resulted in decreases in the net periodic benefit cost for the pbop plan of  and  respectively 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
income taxes provisions for income taxes are calculated in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates for each period for which a statement of earnings is presented 
this process involves estimating the company s current tax liabilities as well as assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from the timing of the deductions of expenses and recognition of taxable income for tax and book accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company accounts for income tax assets  liabilities and expenses in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
and under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of fas depreciation depreciation expense is calculated on a group straight line basis based on the useful lives of assets and judgment is involved when estimating the useful lives of certain assets 
the company conducts independent depreciation studies on a periodic basis as part of the regulatory ratemaking process and considers the results presented in these studies in determining the useful lives of the company s fixed assets 
a change in the estimated useful lives of these assets could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contingencies the company s accounting policy is to record and or disclose commitments and contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
applies to an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
as of december   the company is not aware of any material commitments or contingencies other than those disclosed in the significant contractual obligations table in the contractual obligations section above and the commitments and contingencies footnote to the company s consolidated financial statements below 
refer to recently issued accounting pronouncements in note of the notes of consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk please also refer to item a 
risk factors 
interest rate risk as discussed above  unitil meets its external financing needs by issuing short term and long term debt 
the majority of debt outstanding represents long term notes bearing fixed rates of interest 
changes in market interest rates do not affect interest expense resulting from these outstanding long term debt securities 
however  the company periodically repays its short term debt borrowings through the issuance of new long term debt securities 
changes in market interest rates may affect the interest rate and corresponding interest expense on any new issuances of long term debt securities 
in addition  short term debt borrowings bear a variable rate of interest 
as a result  changes in short term interest rates will increase or decrease interest expense in future periods 
for example  if the average amount of short term debt outstanding was million for the period of one year  a change in interest rates of would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately  the average interest rate on short term borrowings was   and during   and  respectively 
market risk although unitil s three distribution utilities are subject to commodity price risk as part of their traditional operations  the current regulatory framework within which these companies operate allows for full collection of electric power and natural gas supply costs in rates on a pass through basis 
consequently  there is limited commodity price risk after consideration of the related rate making 
additionally  as discussed above and below in regulatory matters  the company has divested its commodity related contracts and therefore  further reduced its exposure to commodity risk
