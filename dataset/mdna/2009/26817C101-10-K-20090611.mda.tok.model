we define ebitda as gaap net income adjusted for interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  loss on extinguishment of debt  and a portion of other expense related to interest rate swap losses 
we use ebitda as a supplemental measure in the evaluation of our business and believe that ebitda provides a meaningful measure of operational performance on a consolidated basis  because it eliminates the effects of period to period changes in taxes  costs associated with capital investments and interest expense and is consistent with one of the measures we use to evaluate management s performance for incentive compensation 
ebitda is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 
accordingly  it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
when evaluating ebitda  investors should consider  among other factors  i increasing or decreasing trends in ebitda  ii whether ebitda has remained at positive levels historically  and iii how ebitda compares to our debt outstanding 
the non gaap measure of ebitda does have certain limitations 
it does not include interest expense  which is a necessary and ongoing part of our cost structure resulting from debt incurred to expand operations 
ebitda also excludes tax  depreciation and amortization expenses 
because these are material and recurring items  any measure  including ebitda  that excludes them has a material 
table of contents limitation 
to mitigate these limitations  we have policies and procedures in place to identify expenses that qualify as interest  taxes  loss on debt extinguishments  a portion of other expense related to interest rate swap losses  and depreciation and amortization and to approve and segregate these expenses from other expenses to ensure that ebitda is consistently reflected from period to period 
however  the calculation of ebitda may vary among companies 
therefore  our ebitda presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
ebitda does not give effect to the cash we must use to service our debt or pay income taxes and thus does not reflect the funds generated from operations or actually available for capital investments backlog data is as of the end of the applicable period

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  and other data contained elsewhere in this annual report 
please see item a 
risk factors and forward looking statements for a discussion of the risks  uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements 
unless otherwise noted  all amounts discussed herein are consolidated 
all references in this annual report to fiscal years of the us government pertain to the fiscal year which ends on september th of each year 
company overview we are a leading provider of specialized mission critical professional and support services outsourced by the us military  non military us governmental agencies and foreign governments 
our specific global expertise is in law enforcement training and support  security services  base and logistics operations  construction management  aviation services and operations  and linguist services 
we also provide logistics support for all our services 
as of april   we had approximately  employees  including employees from our consolidated subsidiaries  in countries  approximately active contracts ranging in duration from three to ten years and approximately active task orders 
we have provided essential services to numerous us government departments and agencies since 
table of contents during fiscal years through  we conducted our operations through two reportable segments gs and mtss 
on march   we divided our gs operating segment into two new segments  iss and lcm  to enable us to better capitalize on business development opportunities and enhance our ongoing service 
our iss operating segment consists of our law enforcement and security strategic business unit  our specialty aviation and counter drug operations strategic business unit and gls  our joint venture for the inscom contract 
our lcm operating segment consists of our contingency and logistics operations strategic business unit and our operations maintenance and construction management strategic business unit and includes any work awarded under the logcap iv 
our third segment is mtss  which did not significantly change 
on april   we announced a further reorganization of our business structure to better align with strategic markets and streamline our infrastructure 
under the new alignment  our three reportable segments were realigned into three new segments  two of which  gsds and gpss  are wholly owned  and a third segment gls  which is a owned joint venture 
the new structure became effective april   the start of our fiscal year  and is more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the information presented below  note to our consolidated financial statements contains additional information about our operating segments and geographic areas in which we have conducted business for fiscal years   and we have restated the corresponding items of segment information for fiscal years and to conform to our fiscal year segment presentation 
current operating environment and outlook external factors over most of the last two decades  the us government has increased its reliance on the private sector for a wide range of professional and support services 
this increased use of outsourcing by the us government has been driven by a variety of factors including lean government initiatives launched in the s  surges in demand during times of national crisis  the increased complexity of missions conducted by the us military and the dos  increased focus of the us military on war fighting efforts  and the loss of skills within the government caused by workforce reductions and retirements 
in the current environment of economic uncertainty and market turmoil  developing and implementing spending  tax  and other initiatives to stimulate the faltering economy is at the forefront of the us government s activities 
while we expect to see continued support for defense initiatives under the obama administration  we expect that initiatives to address economic stimulus will compete with other national priorities  such as dod and dos initiatives 
while these dynamics will place pressure on defense spending  we believe that  within the defense budget  weapon system acquisitions will be the most likely initial target for budget reductions  and operations and maintenance budgets will remain robust  driven by i the need to reset equipment coming out of iraq  ii the logistics and support chain associated with repositioning of forces and eventual draw down in iraq and iii deployments into afghanistan 
although the ultimate size of future defense budgets remains uncertain  current indications are that overall defense spending will continue to increase over the next few years  albeit at lower rates of growth relative to those of the last decade 
we believe the following industry trends will result in continued strong demand in our target markets for the types of outsourced services we provide the continued transformation of military forces  leading to increased outsourcing of non combat functions  including life cycle asset management functions ranging from organizational to depot level maintenance  an increased level and frequency of overseas deployment and peace keeping operations for the dos and dod  increased maintenance  overhaul and upgrade needs to support aging military platforms  increased outsourcing by foreign governments of maintenance  supply support  facilities management and construction management related services  and a shift by the us government from single award to more multiple award idiq contracts  which may offer us an opportunity to increase revenue under these contracts by competing for task orders with the other contract awardees 
both the us and iraqi governments have recently communicated the goal and intent for us troop reductions from iraq 
the exact timing of the initial withdrawal and amount of time to fully withdraw us troops is uncertain 
however  many industry observers believe that the withdrawal will commence between and on the other hand  president obama has indicated his 
table of contents support for expanded troop levels in afghanistan 
as a result  we expect our level of business involving iraq to be relatively stable over the next few years  with demand remaining strong for logistics  equipment reset  training and mentoring of iraqi forces and government agencies and translation services to support security and peacekeeping activities 
in afghanistan  we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on increased us government focus through many of our service offerings  including police training and mentoring  aircraft logistics and operations  infrastructure development  mine resistant and ambush protected or mrap services  poppy eradication and logistics services under logcap iv 
current economic conditions we believe that our industry and customer base are less likely to be affected by many of the factors generally affecting business and consumer spending 
accordingly  we believe that we continue to be well positioned in the current economic environment as a result of historic demand factors affecting our industry  the nature of our contracts and our sources of liquidity 
however  we cannot be certain that the economic environment or other factors will not adversely impact our business  financial condition or results of operations in the future 
furthermore  we believe that our current sources of liquidity will enable us to continue to perform under our existing contracts and further grow our business 
however  a longer term credit crisis could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional liquidity or refinance existing indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item a 
risk factors current or worsening economic conditions could adversely impact our business  for a discussion of the risks associated with the current economic condition 
internal factors our internal focus for success centers around five key principles relentless performance through a relentless mindset in meeting our commitments to our customers every day and in operating with absolute integrity and in accordance with our code of ethics and business conduct in all that we do 
lean infrastructure in order to further fuel our growth and invest in our people  we must generate additional investment capacity by ensuring that our infrastructure is as efficient as possible without jeopardizing our ability to perform 
clear strategic investment we must have clarity in our strategic priorities  and we must properly focus our investments in people  new program pursuits and efforts to penetrate new segments of the market 
new business growing our business profitably starts with winning new business 
this involves having a winning attitude across our enterprise  particularly in satisfying our current customers and competing for new business 
people we must be the employer of choice  with strong  trusted leadership  an employee focused environment and a culture of mutual respect in which our employees are empowered and rewarded for serving our customers and ensuring their success 
we apply these key principles continuously as we assess our operational and administrative performance 
fiscal year developments logistics civil augmentation program in april  after extended protest and review  the us army sustainment command selected us  along with kbr inc and fluor corporation  as the providers of logistics support to the us army under the logcap iv contract 
the logcap iv contract has a ceiling value of billion with a term of up to ten years and an annual ceiling value to us of billion in revenue per year 
task orders will be competed on with the other two awardees and will vary from year to year  depending on us army funding and strategic objectives 
under this contract  we will support us forces worldwide with immediate focus on those deployed in the middle east 
we started performance on two task orders based in kuwait in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 
table of contents change of ceo on may   we filed a form k announcing the appointment of william l 
ballhaus as president and chief executive officer  effective may  he succeeded herb j 
lanese  who was terminated without cause from his duties as chief executive officer  but continues to serve on our board of directors 
difz sale on july   we sold of our ownership interest in our previously wholly owned subsidiary  dyncorp international fz llc difz  for approximately million 
we financed the transaction by accepting three promissory notes provided by the purchaser 
as a result  the financed portion of the sale was accounted for as a capital transaction reflected in additional paid in capital apic 
the notes are to be repaid through the purchaser s portion of difz quarterly dividends and a million down payment 
we have recognized a gain of million on the sale from receipt of the cash payment in fiscal year as of april   the sales price was adjusted to million  based on the results of a revaluation required by the sales agreement  contingent on approval by the difz board of directors 
the adjustment to the purchase price was reflected as an increase to the promissory notes 
difz remains a consolidated subsidiary in our financial statements  as it was determined that we remain the primary beneficiary 
see further discussion in note afghan construction the results of our operations for fiscal year exceeded expectations across our core business areas with the exception of our afghanistan construction contracts within our lcm segment  which encountered cost overruns due to significant challenges  including the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan 
management has determined that several of our firm fixed price afghanistan construction contracts will operate at a loss or at margins approaching zero over their contract terms 
we do not expect to bid any similar firm fixed price contracts without revised terms and conditions 
see consolidated results of operations for further information regarding the financial impact of our construction business on our consolidated financial results 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended march  consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our consolidated results of operations  both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue fiscal year ended april  march  dollars in thousands revenue cost of services selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expense operating income interest expense loss on early extinguishment of debt  net earnings from affiliates interest income other income  net income before taxes provision for income taxes income before minority interest minority interest net income 
table of contents revenue revenue for fiscal year increased million  or  as compared to fiscal year  reflecting increased revenue in all operating segments 
the increase  as more fully described in the results by segment  is principally due to growth from new contracts  in particular  the inscom contract 
cost of services cost of services is comprised of direct labor  direct material  subcontractor costs  other direct costs and overhead 
other direct costs include travel  supplies and other miscellaneous costs 
cost of services for fiscal year increased million as compared to fiscal year  primarily the result of the ramp up of the inscom contract 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of services increased to of revenue in fiscal year from of revenue in fiscal year this was primarily a result of a change in contract mix as we earned more revenue from cost reimbursement type contracts than from firm fixed priced type contracts  with the inscom contract and changes in portions of the civpol contract driving this shift 
in addition to our change in contract mix  cost overruns by our afghanistan construction contracts  as further described below  also contributed to higher cost of services as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year compared to fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a primarily relates to functions such as management  legal  finance  accounting  contracts and administration  human resources  management information systems  purchasing and business development 
sg a for fiscal year decreased million  or  compared to fiscal year sg a decreased primarily as a result of lean infrastructure initiatives  primarily through personnel reductions and process efficiency implementations  focused on controlling sg a costs  offset by approximately million in severance costs  including severance costs from the involuntary termination of our former ceo 
fiscal year sg a compared to fiscal year was also positively impacted by non recurring bid and proposal costs associated with the inscom contract which were incurred in fiscal year interest expense interest expense for fiscal year increased by million  or  as compared to fiscal year the increase in interest expense is primarily due to a higher average outstanding debt balance and higher average interest rates as a result of our fiscal year debt financing as further discussed in liquidity capital resources 
in addition to the change in interest expense  deferred financing fees associated with our prior debt were also written off as further discussed in note the impact of this write off is separately disclosed as loss on early extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of income 
income tax expense our effective tax rate of for fiscal year decreased from for fiscal year our effective tax rate was impacted by the tax treatment of our gls and difz joint ventures which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes but are not consolidated for tax purposes as they are taxed as partnerships under the internal revenue code 
minority interest minority interest reflects the impact of our joint venture partners interest in our consolidated joint ventures  gls and difz 
for fiscal year  minority interest for gls and difz was million and million  respectively 
in fiscal year  minority interest for gls was additive to our net income as gls was operating at a net loss 
there was no minority interest related to difz  as it was a wholly owned subsidiary during fiscal year impact of our afghanistan construction contracts for fiscal year  revenue from our afghanistan construction contracts was million  as compared to million for fiscal year the remaining revenue through completion of these contracts is expected to be approximately million 
as discussed in current operating environment and outlook fiscal year developments above  our afghanistan construction business encountered operational difficulties during fiscal year  which resulted in higher non reimbursable delivery costs and contractual milestone delays 
as a result  a contract loss reserve and associated provision  specific to a large firm fixed price construction contract in afghanistan  was estimated and recorded during the second quarter of fiscal year  which totaled million 
based on our assessment of the status of this project and considering the current security environment in afghanistan  additional contract losses totaling million were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year utilization of the contract loss reserve through april  was million 
the recording of the additional third quarter loss also triggered an interim assessment of goodwill for potential impairment  as further discussed in note to our financial statements 
as a result of this assessment  we concluded that no goodwill impairment had occurred 
additionally  revisions were made to the estimated margins on all other firm fixed priced afghanistan construction contracts within the operations maintenance and construction management omcm strategic business unit 
these firm fixed price afghanistan construction contracts are expected to operate with margins at or approaching zero over their remaining contract terms 

table of contents the contract loss provision and revisions to estimated margins are based on the best information currently available 
although we believe that these amounts have been estimated appropriately  there can be no assurance that future events will not require us to revise these estimates 
results by segment the following table sets forth the revenue and operating income for the iss  lcm and mtss operating segments  for fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year dollar amounts in thousands 
international security services fiscal year ended fiscal year ended april  march  change revenue operating income revenue revenue for fiscal year increased million  or  as compared to fiscal year the increase primarily resulted from the following law enforcement and security revenue increased million  or  primarily due to increases in our security services in iraq  palestine  liberia and haiti  offset by a decline in security services in afghanistan 
revenue from our civilian police services in iraq increased million primarily due to higher personnel levels 
as a result of new contracts started in early fiscal year  we provided civilian police and security services in palestine  liberia and haiti  which contributed million  million and million  respectively  in increased revenue for the fiscal year 
these increases were offset by a decline in afghanistan of million  which was a result of fewer supplies and equipment sales to the customer during fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  combined with a shift from a fixed price contract structure in fiscal year to a cost reimbursable contract structure in fiscal year while we expect revenue from our continuing security services to remain relatively stable in the near term  we anticipate fiscal year revenue to benefit from our new mentoring and training program to iraq s ministry of defense and ministry of interior  which contributed million of revenue in fiscal year specialty aviation and counter drug operations revenue decreased million  or  primarily due to a decline in our international narcotics law enforcement programs resulting from scope reductions  offset by new contracts associated with security and drug eradication training in afghanistan 
global linguist solutions revenue was million for the inscom contract through our gls joint venture  which began in the fourth quarter of fiscal year revenue also benefited from the recognition of the inscom contract award fee of million for fiscal year the award fee is based on achieving specific contract performance criteria  such as operational fill rates 
based on our contract performance history to date  we anticipate the ability to accrue award fees through the remaining life of the inscom contract 
operating income operating income for fiscal year increased million  or  as compared to fiscal year operating income benefited from a reduction in sg a expense of million due primarily to proposal costs in fiscal year associated with inscom  specific contract litigation expenses in fiscal year associated with the worldwide network services wwns litigation as further described in note to our consolidated financial statements and from our lean infrastructure initiatives focused on controlling sg a costs 
specific to our sbus  the increase primarily resulted from the following law enforcement and security operating income decreased million  or  due to declining margins  primarily in our civilian police services 
this margin decline resulted from a shift in portions of our task orders for these services from fixed price in the prior fiscal year to cost reimbursable in the current fiscal year 
these declines were partially offset by the successful resolution of approximately million of prior period billing matters  which positively impacted operating income 
specialty aviation and counter drug operations operating income increased million  or  primarily due to higher margins on several new security and drug eradication training contracts in afghanistan  offset by lower revenue for the fiscal year 
global linguist solutions operating income increased by million to million for fiscal year as gls commenced operations at the end of fiscal year fiscal year operating income benefited from the accrual of the inscom contract award fee  which represents the award earned or accrued based on achieving specific contract performance criteria  such as 
table of contents operational fill rates 
operating income earned by gls benefits net income only by our ownership portion  as of earnings from the joint venture are reflected in minority interest as a reduction to net income 
logistics and construction management fiscal year ended fiscal year ended april  march  change revenue operating loss income revenue revenue for fiscal year increased million  or  as compared to fiscal year the increase primarily resulted from the following contingency and logistics operations revenue increased by million  or  primarily due to the expansion of services in the philippines  which contributed million of the revenue increase 
revenue also benefited from our support services  where we provided temporary housing in response to the severe flooding in iowa during the summer of and increased mediation and humanitarian services provided in sudan 
additionally  logcap iv contributed million of revenue as work began in march on awarded task orders 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in our africa peacekeeping program  primarily a result of reductions in current work levels within this program 
we anticipate fiscal year revenue to benefit significantly from task orders under the logcap iv contract with our other programs remaining steady or experiencing declines due to non recurring work completed during fiscal year operations maintenance and construction management revenue increased million  or  primarily due to continued progress on our afghanistan construction projects 
this was partially offset by the completion of the forward operating locations contract and contract termination for a construction project in nigeria 
as discussed above in consolidated results of operations impact of our afghanistan construction contracts  due to significant challenges on several afghanistan construction contracts  resulting partly from the deteriorating security situation in that country  we do not expect to bid on any similar firm fixed price contracts without revised terms and conditions 
this is expected to impact future revenue in omcm by limiting the construction opportunities available to us 
operating income operating income for fiscal year decreased million to an operating loss of million as compared to operating income of million in fiscal year although operating income benefited by approximately million from our lean infrastructure initiatives focused on controlling sg a costs in the current year  we encountered sbu specific decreases in operating income  primarily as a result of the following contingency and logistics operations operating income decreased by million  or for fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year the decrease was primarily driven by a decline in our africa peacekeeping program  as a result of reductions in current work levels within this program 
operating income was also negatively impacted by costs related to the ramp up of our new logcap iv contract  which was awarded in early fiscal year in fiscal year  logcap iv did not contribute significantly to revenue but incurred costs associated with contract set up and other overhead costs 
in the fourth quarter  we were awarded two logcap iv task orders based in kuwait worth million which we expect will positively impact operating income in future periods over the life of the task orders 
operations maintenance and construction management operating income decreased by million for fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year this was primarily due to costs associated with the construction in afghanistan  which generated million of positive operating income in fiscal year  but  lost million in fiscal year this is further discussed above in consolidated results of operations impact of our afghanistan construction contracts 
we anticipate operating omcm at near breakeven for the foreseeable future 
maintenance and technical support services fiscal year ended fiscal year ended april  march  change revenue operating income revenue revenue for fiscal year increased million  or  as compared to fiscal year the increase primarily resulted from the following 
table of contents contract logistics support revenue increased million  or  primarily due to higher deliveries of support equipment associated with our c and lccs programs 
this increase is primarily due to supplemental increases in us government spending for aircraft upgrades to support the global war on terror 
within these programs  we expect pressure on fiscal year revenue as we anticipate less business from supplemental initiatives 
field service operations revenue increased million  or  primarily due to a new contract for logistics services at fort campbell  which started in may  and increased revenue from higher personnel levels in our cft program 
we expect increased competition on our cft program over the next fiscal year as the number of contractors has increased from four to seven in this service space 
while this could put downward pressure on revenue in fiscal year  we do not believe this will limit our long term opportunities under the cft program 
aviation and maintenance services revenue increased million  or  primarily due to increased work associated with mrap vehicles and increased revenue associated with our general maintenance corps contract  offset by a decline in our marine services and a decrease in threat management systems work 
we expect higher revenue in the fiscal year  primarily driven by growth in our mrap program through anticipated work in afghanistan  partially offset by mrap declines in iraq 
operating income operating income for fiscal year increased million  to million  as compared to million for fiscal year operating income benefited from our lean infrastructure initiatives focused on controlling sg a costs  offset by severance associated with the retiring of our mtss divisional president 
the overall year over year cost reduction attributable to mtss was approximately million 
specific to our sbas  the increase primarily resulted from the following contract logistics support operating income for fiscal year increased by million  to million  as compared to fiscal year the increase was primarily due to improved project management in several key programs 
specifically  we experienced improved profitability on our lccs program due to stringent cost controls implemented during the year and a more favorable product mix which resulted in improved margins 
we expect to sustain the operating income improvements achieved in fiscal year into the next fiscal year 
field service operations operating income increased million  or  for fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  driven primarily by increased revenue 
we expect near term pressure on our margins in fiscal year as a result of more competition on new awards from additional idiq contractors 
aviation and maintenance services operating income increased million  to million for fiscal year  as compared to million for fiscal year  primarily due to increased revenue and improved mix of contracts with better margins  such as mrap 
we expect operating income to benefit by continued growth in our mrap program in fiscal year fiscal year ended march  to fiscal year ended march  consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our consolidated results of operations  both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue

see results by segment below for more analysis of our revenue growth by reportable segment 
cost of services cost of services for fiscal year increased million or primarily due to growth in operations 
as a percentage of revenue  costs of services decreased to for fiscal year ended march  from for fiscal year ended march  the key factors contributing to the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of revenue were continued strong performance of fixed price task orders combined with contract modifications for construction efforts completed in earlier periods within the lcm operating segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the fiscal year ended march  increased million or as compared with the fiscal year ended march  factors contributing to the increased sg a included i litigation costs associated primarily with the wwns litigation  which is further described in note to our consolidated financial statements  ii costs incurred in fiscal year related to our sarbanes oxley compliance preparation  iii consulting costs related to proposal activity for potential new contracts  and iv general sg a costs necessary to support the current and anticipated growth of our business 
offsetting these increases were i non recurring severance costs incurred in fiscal year for certain former executives  and ii bonus compensation incurred in fiscal year associated with our initial public offering 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization for the fiscal year ended march  decreased million  or as compared to the fiscal year ended march   primarily due to the effects of acquired software becoming fully amortized during the fiscal year 
interest expense interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  decreased million  or as compared with the fiscal year ended march  the decrease was primarily due to lower average debt outstanding in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the fiscal year ended march  the interest expense incurred relates to our then existing senior secured credit facility  the senior subordinated notes and amortization of deferred financing fees 
interest income interest income for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or as compared with the fiscal year ended march  due to higher average balance of our cash sweep accounts 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended march  increased million or as compared to the fiscal year ended march  due to an increase in taxable income offset by a reduction in the effective tax rate to from for the fiscal years ended march  and march  respectively

table of contents international security services fiscal year ended fiscal year ended march  march  change revenue operating income revenue revenue for fiscal year increased million  or  as compared to fiscal year the increase primarily resulted from the following fluctuations within our sbus as viewed by segment management law enforcement and security revenue decreased million primarily due to a decline in revenue from our operations in iraq of million offset by an increase in afghanistan of million 
an additional million increase was attributable mainly to non recurring work in other middle eastern nations 
in iraq  we experienced a million decrease in our civpol services due to the transition of our operations from leased facilities to customer furnished facilities 
as we had operated these leased locations and earned revenue through task orders  this planned transition from these facilities negatively affected our civpol revenue 
despite the decline from the relocation  our core civpol personnel levels remained consistent in iraq and were not a driver of the decrease 
the remaining decrease in revenue from our operations in iraq was driven primarily by declines in non recurring work associated with our personal protection services of million 
the increase in revenue from our operations in afghanistan was due largely to increased personnel levels as well as additional services associated with the afghan poppy eradication program 
specialty aviation and counter drug operations revenue increased million primarily due to a million increase in drug eradication services and million of increase in other services 
our drug eradication services continue to grow through increases in our scope of services for these projects 
we experienced significant growth in afghanistan where our services have played a key role in reducing narcotics in that country 
global linguist solutions revenue was million for the new inscom contract through our gls joint venture  which began in our fiscal fourth quarter 
operating income operating income for fiscal year was consistent with fiscal year the following sets forth the operating income for the iss segment for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year law enforcement and security operating income increased million as a result of improved contract performance and elimination of non recurring write offs from contract losses that occurred in the prior year 
our improved contract performance was primarily a result of effective cost management strategies executed in fiscal year  which allowed us to improve operating income despite a decline in revenue for our services within this sbu 
specialty aviation and counter drug operations operating income decreased million due to charges related to non fee bearing  unscheduled maintenance of aircraft during the fiscal year 
while the nature of this incremental work had a positive and significant impact on revenue  its structure as a cost reimbursable only contract did not provide a benefit to operating income 
global linguist solutions start up costs associated with this contract contributed to a decrease in our operating income of million through the fiscal year ended march  general sg a factors we incurred a decrease of million in operating income related to sg a expenses in the current fiscal year 
the fluctuation was due primarily to additional expenses from proposal costs associated with inscom  specific contract litigation expenses associated with the wwns litigation  further described in note to our consolidated financial statements  and increases in necessary support functions associated with our current and anticipated growth 
these cost increases were offset by one time costs incurred in the prior year related to severance expenses for certain former executives and bonus compensation associated with our initial public offering 
logistics construction management fiscal year ended fiscal year ended march  march  change revenue operating income revenue revenue for fiscal year increased million  or  as compared to fiscal year the increase primarily resulted from the following fluctuations within our sbus as viewed by segment management 
table of contents contingency and logistics operations revenue decreased by million primarily due to non recurring revenue associated with hurricane katrina in fiscal year operations maintenance and construction management revenue increased million due to the ramp up in various construction projects in afghanistan 
our strategic focus has been on our construction services where we are executing a strategy that includes capitalizing on our construction expertise and our global resources in these areas 
because of our focus on this aspect of the business  growth in construction has outpaced our other services within this sbu  such as equipment positioning and military logistics 
operating income operating income for the fiscal year ended march  decreased million or  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  the decrease primarily resulted from the following contingency and logistics operations operating income decreased by million primarily due to the decline in revenue for non recurring projects as discussed above 
operations maintenance and construction management continued growth through the ramp up of new construction projects helped increase our operating income by million 
general sg a factors we incurred an increase of million in operating income 
the improvement in sg a expense was primarily a result of one time costs incurred in the prior year related to severance expenses for certain former executives and bonus compensation associated with our initial public offering offset by additional expenses from proposal costs associated with logcap iv 
maintenance technical support services fiscal year ended fiscal year ended march  march  change revenue operating income revenue revenue for fiscal year increased million  or  as compared to fiscal year the increase primarily resulted from the following fluctuations within our sbas as viewed by segment management contract logistics support revenue increased million due to escalating support requirements associated with our lccs programs  which include various services such as overhauls  support personnel and equipment supply  primarily for deployments in iraq and afghanistan 
the increase was driven by shorter time periods between field overhauls on engines and propellers  which are two of our key services 
a trend of higher overhauls was noted during the year due to a combination of factors including longer equipment deployments  higher flight volumes and the harsh desert conditions in those regions 
field service operations revenue decreased million due to a temporary decline in personnel and level of services provided resulting from longer deployment cycles of equipment in iraq and afghanistan 
while the longer deployment cycles have benefited our contract logistics support sba  it has created a temporary decline in our fso as planes and equipment are not rotated out of the theatre as frequently for complete resetting overhauls 
aviation maintenance services revenue increased million primarily due to increased work associated with mine resistant vehicles and new threat management systems offset by normal occurrence of completed projects 
operating income operating income for the fiscal year ended march  increased million or  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  the increase primarily resulted from the following contract logistics support operating income increased million due to better margins realized on higher revenue associated with our lccs programs primarily supporting deployments in iraq and afghanistan  in addition to non recurring losses from fiscal year associated with our commercial support services program 
field service operations operating income decreased million due to lower revenue offset by lower operating costs 
the decrease in revenue created an undesirable cost structure due to the nature of our services within this sba 

table of contents aviation maintenance services operating income increased million  which was a result of higher revenue offset by a decrease in margin from several high margin non recurring projects in fiscal year  in addition to no margin cost reimbursement only projects for aircraft maintenance in fiscal year  which increased revenue but ultimately reduced operating margin percentages 
general sg a factors we incurred an increase of million in operating income related to sg a expenses in the current fiscal year 
the fluctuation was primarily due to one time costs incurred in the prior year related to severance expenses for certain former executives and bonus compensation associated with our initial public offering 
liquidity and capital resources cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our senior secured credit facility are our primary sources of short term liquidity 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations and our available borrowings under our senior secured credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months 
our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on numerous factors beyond our control 
we cannot be assured that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we expect that our improved cash collection efforts achieved in fiscal year  evidenced by our reduced days sales outstanding  are sustainable in fiscal year and will help facilitate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our expected growth 
in addition  we expect cash contributions from our logcap iv collaborative partners to contribute funding for operations 
however  to support growth related to potential contract and task order awards that could occur in the next fiscal year and servicing our current indebtedness  we may require additional financing beyond that currently provided from operations and by our senior secured credit facility 
there can be no assurance that sufficient financing will continue to be available in the future or that it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
failure to obtain sufficient capital could materially hinder our future expansion strategies 
we are required  under certain circumstances as defined in our senior secured credit facility  to use a percentage of cash generated from operations to reduce the outstanding principal of our term loan 
based on the fiscal year financial performance and ending balances  we expect this repayment to be million  which is anticipated to be paid in july the amount of the actual repayment can be reduced at the option of our lenders 
cash flow analysis the following table sets forth cash flow data for the periods indicated therein fiscal year ended april  march  march  dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash used by provided by financing activities fiscal year compared to fiscal year cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year was million as compared to million cash provided by operations for fiscal year our increase in operating cash flow for the fiscal year was primarily the result of higher cash generated from operations  partially offset by a reduction in cash from an increase in our net working capital 
cash generated from operations benefited from the combination of our continued revenue growth from new contracts and improved operating efficiency 
the change in net working capital was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable 
net of revenue growth  our accounts receivable actually improved due to billing and collection efficiencies implemented during fiscal year as a result of these efforts  days sales outstanding  a key metric utilized by management to monitor collection efforts on accounts receivable  decreased from days as of march  to days as of april  cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal year  as compared to million for fiscal year this use of cash from investing activities was primarily a result of the combination of fewer pp e and software purchases during fiscal year  as compared to such purchases in fiscal year 
table of contents cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal year  as compared to million for fiscal year the cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year was primarily a result of the million net effect of extinguishing debt and issuing new debt discussed below as well as in note of our consolidated financial statements 
cash used of million in financing activities for fiscal year was due primarily to repayments of principal on debt 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year operating cash flow was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  as compared to the fiscal year the decrease in operating cash flow compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to changes in working capital  particularly in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets of million offset by a net release of restricted cash in fiscal year  as compared to a net use of cash in fiscal year  which had a net impact of million 
the million increase in net income also helped offset the decreases from working capital 
the changes in working capital were due to the timing of collections along with business growth from new customers net of gls expenditures in the fiscal year 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the increase in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to a permanent investment in an unconsolidated equity investee 
cash flows used in financing activities were million for fiscal year  compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of million in fiscal year the cash used by financing activities was primarily related to the repayment of borrowings under our term loans of million and net repayments made under other financing arrangements of million 
financing long term debt consisted of april  march  dollars in thousands term loans senior subordinated notes subtotal less current portion of long term debt total long term debt on july  we entered into a senior secured credit facility consisting of a senior secured term loan term loan of million  and a senior secured revolving credit facility revolving facility of up to million 
borrowings under our term loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the london interbank offered rate libor  plus an applicable margin determined by reference to the leverage ratio  as set forth in the credit agreement the applicable margin  or the base rate plus the applicable margin at our election 
the applicable margin for libor as of april  was  resulting in a interest rate on our term loan 
on march   we amended our senior secured credit facility 
this amendment reduced certain excess cash flow repayment requirements as defined under our existing secured credit agreement dated as of july   and expanded the current ability to repurchase our common stock to include the right to redeem a portion of the senior subordinated notes due issued by our operating company and div capital corporation 
we expect to make a million principal payment in july as required by our senior secured credit facility 
this repayment will impact the remaining term loan principal payment schedule 
the revised term loan principal installments are due quarterly starting with september for million  million in quarterly installments from december through june  million in quarterly payments from september through june  and a final principal payment of million on the august  the term loan expiration date 
borrowings under the senior secured credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets and the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
a portion of the revolving facility is available for letters of credit and swingline loans 
borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the base rate plus an applicable margin or libor plus the applicable margin 
as of april  and march   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving facility 
our available borrowing capacity under the revolving facility totaled million at april   which gives effect to million of outstanding letters of credit under the letter of credit sub facility 
with respect to each letter of credit  a quarterly 
table of contents commission in an amount equal to the face amount of such letter of credit multiplied by the applicable margin and a nominal fronting fee are required to be paid 
the combined rate as of april  was we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to cash flows related to our senior secured credit facility 
these agreements are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
in july  we completed a private placement pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended  of million in aggregate principal amount of additional senior subordinated notes  which were issued under the same indenture as the senior subordinated notes issued in february net proceeds from the additional offering of senior subordinated notes were used to refinance our then existing senior secured credit facility  to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes 
the additional senior subordinated notes mature on february  the additional senior subordinated notes were issued at approximately a discount totaling million 
deferred financing fees associated with this offering totaled million 
our registration statement with respect to these notes was declared effective on january  we launched an exchange offer for the notes that ended on february  we can redeem the senior subordinated notes  in whole or in part  at defined redemption prices  plus accrued interest to the redemption date 
the senior subordinated notes may require us to repurchase the senior subordinated notes at defined prices in the event of certain specified triggering events  including but not limited to certain asset sales  change of control events  and debt covenant violations 
in march  under a board authorized program  we redeemed approximately million face value of our senior subordinated notes in the open market for million  including applicable transaction fees 
as of april   million of this transaction was cash settled  with the remaining settlement occurring in fiscal year we recorded a million gain on this extinguishment after deduction of associated deferred financing fees and discounts

off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the definition under sec rules  the following qualify as off balance sheet arrangements any obligation under certain guarantee contracts  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  and any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
as of april   we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity  and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above 
we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
refer to note and note of our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure 
effects of inflation we have generally been able to anticipate increases in costs when pricing our contracts 
bids for longer term fixed price and time and materials type contracts typically include sufficient labor and other cost escalations in amounts expected to cover cost increases over the period of performance 
consequently  because costs and revenue include an inflationary increase commensurate with the general economy in which we operate  net income as a percentage of revenue has not been materially impacted by inflation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and the disclosure of related contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions  including our historical experience  where relevant 
these significant estimates and assumptions are reviewed quarterly by management with oversight by the disclosure committee  an internal committee comprised of members of senior management with detailed knowledge of our business 
we ask this committee to review our compliance with accounting and disclosure requirements  to evaluate the fairness of our financial and non financial disclosures  and to report their findings to us 
this evaluation process includes a thorough review of key estimates and assumptions used in preparing our financial statements 
because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements  actual results may differ from the estimates  and the difference may be material 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are those policies and estimates that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following represents our critical accounting policies 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
management and our external auditors have discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we are predominantly a services provider and only include products or systems when necessary for the execution of the service arrangement and as such  systems  equipment or materials are not generally separable from services 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services or products have been provided to the client  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
each arrangement is unique and revenue recognition is evaluated on a contract by contract basis 
our contracts typically fall into four categories with the first representing the vast majority of our revenue 
the categories are federal government contracts  construction type contracts  software contracts and other contracts 
we apply the appropriate guidance consistently to similar contracts 

table of contents we expense pre contract costs as incurred for an anticipated contract until the contract is awarded 
throughout the life of the contract  indirect costs  including general and administrative costs  are expensed as incurred 
management regularly reviews project profitability and underlying estimates 
revisions to estimates are reflected in results of operations as a change in accounting estimate in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known by management 
major factors we consider in determining total estimated revenue and cost include the basic contract price  contract options  change orders modifications of the original contract  back charges and claims  and contract provisions for penalties  award fees and performance incentives 
all of these factors and other special contract provisions are evaluated throughout the life of our contracts when estimating total contract revenue under the percentage of completion or proportional methods of accounting 
federal government contracts for all non construction and non software us federal government contracts or contract elements  we apply the guidance in the american institute of certified public accountants audit and accounting guide  federal government contractors  or aag fgc 
we apply the combination and segmentation guidance in the aag fgc in analyzing the deliverables contained in the applicable contract to determine appropriate profit centers 
revenue is recognized by profit center using the percentage of completion method or completed contract method 
the completed contract method is sometimes used when reliable estimates cannot be supported for percentage of completion method recognition or for short duration projects when the results of operations would not vary materially from those resulting from use of the percentage of completion method 
until complete  project costs are maintained in work in progress  a component of inventory 
projects under our us federal government contracts typically have different pricing mechanisms that influence how revenue is earned and recognized 
these pricing mechanisms are classified as cost plus fixed fee  fixed price  cost plus award fee  time and materials including unit price level of effort contracts 
any of these contract types can be executed under an idiq contract  which does not represent a firm order for services 
as a result  the exact timing and quantity of delivery and pricing mechanism for idiq profit centers are not known at the time of contract award  but they can contain any type of pricing mechanism 
revenue on projects with a fixed price or fixed fee  including award fees  is generally recognized ratably over the contract period measured by either output or input methods appropriate to the services or products provided 
for example  output measures can include period of service  such as for aircraft fleet maintenance  and units delivered or produced  such as aircraft for which modification has been completed 
input measures can include a cost to cost method  such as for procurement related services 
revenue on time and materials projects is recognized at contractual billing rates for applicable units of measure eg labor hours incurred  units delivered 
construction contracts or contract elements for all construction contracts or contract elements  revenue is recognized by profit center using the percentage of completion method 
software contracts or contract elements it is our policy to review any arrangement containing software or software deliverables using applicable gaap guidance for software revenue recognition to ensure accurate accounting of these arrangements as discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year we never sell software on a separate  standalone basis 
as a result  software arrangements are typically accounted for as one unit of accounting and are recognized over the service period  including the period of post contract customer support 
other contracts or contract elements our contracts with non federal government customers are predominantly multiple element 
multiple element arrangements involve multiple obligations in various combinations to perform services  deliver equipment or materials  grant licenses or other rights  or take certain actions 
we evaluate all deliverables in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting and arrangement consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
fair values are established by evaluating vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence if available 
due to the customized nature of our arrangements  vsoe and third party evidence is generally not available resulting in applicable arrangements being accounted for as one unit of accounting 
deferred taxes  tax valuation allowances and tax reserves our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management s best estimate of future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

table of contents deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized 
valuation allowances applicable to our company primarily relate to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards for us and non us subsidiaries 
in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we assess the need for any related valuation allowances or adjust the amount of any allowances  if necessary 
we assess such factors as our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the need for or sufficiency of a valuation allowance 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 
implementation of different tax structures in certain jurisdictions could also impact the need for certain valuation allowances 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in potential assessments 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
we establish reserves for open tax years for uncertain tax positions that may be subject to challenge by various tax authorities 
the consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate 
on march   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
fin no 
 which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed  or expected to be claimed  on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin no 
 we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities 
the determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties on income taxes  accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters  and our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities 
to the extent that the expected tax outcome of these matters changes  such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
equity based compensation expense we have adopted the provisions of and accounted for equity based compensation in accordance with fasb no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions  equity based compensation expense is measured using the grant date fair value for equity awards or is revalued each accounting period for liability awards 
see note for further information regarding the sfas no 
r disclosures 
we currently have two types of share based payment awards  rsus and class b membership interests in div holding llc the class b membership interests 
our rsus are classified as liability awards under gaap and are revalued based on our closing stock price at the end of each accounting period 
the class b membership interests are equity awards under gaap 
class b membership interests are valued at the grant date using a discounted cash flow technique to arrive at a fair value of the class b membership interests 
our fair value analysis includes the following variables our stock price  outstanding common shares  div holding llc ownership percentage  remaining preference to class a holders  and a discount for lack of marketability 
the discount for lack of marketability for each grant was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton put call parity relationship computation 
the determination of the fair value of the class b membership interests is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions including volatility  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the pricing model on a forward curve of risk free interest rates based on constant maturity rates provided by the us treasury 
we have not paid  
table of contents and do not anticipate paying  any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore used an expected dividend yield of zero in the pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data and probable future events to estimate forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
our share based payment awards vest ratably  based on vesting terms which typically range from one to three years  over the requisite service periods  which differ from our recognition of compensation expense that is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award 
impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and in any interim period in which circumstances arise that indicate our goodwill may be impaired 
indicators of impairment include  but are not limited to  the loss of significant business  operating performance indicators  sizable decreases in federal government appropriations or funding for our contracts  or other considerable adverse changes in industry or market conditions 
we estimate a portion of the fair value of our reporting units under the income approach by utilizing a discounted cash flow model based on several factors including balance sheet carrying values  historical results  our most recent forecasts  and other relevant quantitative and qualitative information 
we discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation 
we also use the market approach to estimate the remaining portion of our reporting unit valuation 
this technique utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate 
while the income approach has the advantage of utilizing more company specific information  the market approach has the advantage of capturing market based transaction pricing 
preparation of forecasts and the selection of the discount rate involve significant judgments that we base primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  and general market conditions 
also  the weighting assigned to the income approach results and market approach results also impacts the reporting unit valuation 
significant changes in these forecasts  the discount rate selected  or the weighting of the income and market approach could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
the combined estimated fair value of all of our reporting units from the weighted total of the market approach and income approach often results in a premium over our market capitalization  commonly referred to as a control premium 
recent accounting pronouncements the information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is included in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report  which is incorporated herein by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk primarily relating to potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
for a further discussion of market risks we may encounter  see item a 
risk factors 
interest rate risk we have interest rate risk relating to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
our policy is to manage interest rate exposure through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt instruments 
our senior subordinated notes represent our fixed rate debt  which totaled million  including unamortized discount  as of april  our term loan and revolving facility represent our variable rate debt 
as of april   the balance of our term loan was million and we had no borrowings under our revolving facility 
borrowings under our variable rate debt bear interest  based on our option  at a rate per annum equal to libor  plus the applicable margin or the base rate plus the applicable margin 
each quarter point change in interest rates on our outstanding variable rate debt as of april   results in approximately million change in annual interest expense 
our term loan and revolving facility are structured through a syndicate of banks and are not actively traded 
our senior subordinated notes are publicly traded and had a quoted aggregate market value of approximately million based on an actual market trade price on april  during fiscal year  in order to mitigate interest rate risk related to our term loan  we entered into three interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million 
these interest rate swaps effectively fixed the interest rate  including 
table of contents applicable margin  on the first million of our debt indexed to libor 
the notional principal of million that was covered through september expired and the remaining million is protected through may foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to changes in foreign currency rates 
at present  we do not utilize any derivative instruments to manage risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the functional currency of certain foreign operations is the local currency 
accordingly  these foreign entities translate assets and liabilities from their local currencies to us dollars using year end exchange rates while income and expense accounts are translated at the average rates in effect during the year 
the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
our foreign currency transactions are not material as of april
