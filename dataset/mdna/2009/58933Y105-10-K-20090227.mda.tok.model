item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
us product approvals on january   the fda approved emend fosaprepitant dimeglumine for injection  mg  for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting 
emend for injection provides a new option for day one  as a substitute for emend mg taken orally  as part of the recommended three day regimen 
prior to the fda decision  the european union eu on january  granted marketing approval for emend for injection  known as ivemend in the eu  an action that applies to all eu member countries as well as norway and iceland 
on august   merck announced that the fda approved an expanded label for cancidas  which makes it the first and only echinocandin therapy approved in the united states for the treatment of pediatric patients aged three months to years with indicated fungal infections 
on september   the fda approved gardasil for the prevention of vulvar and vaginal cancers caused by hpv types and the approval is based on data from a combined analysis of three studies that demonstrated the efficacy and safety of gardasil in more than  patients 
vioxx us product liability settlement on september   merck announced a voluntary worldwide withdrawal of vioxx  its arthritis and acute pain medication 
the company s decision  which was effective immediately  was based on new three year data from a prospective  randomized  placebo controlled clinical trial  approve adenomatous polyp prevention on vioxx 
on november   the company announced that it had entered into an agreement the settlement agreement with the law firms that comprise the executive committee of the plaintiffs steering committee of the federal multidistrict vioxx litigation as well as representatives of plaintiffs counsel in the texas  new jersey and california state coordinated proceedings to resolve state and federal myocardial infarction mi and ischemic stroke is claims filed as of that date in the united states 
the settlement agreement  which also applies to tolled claims  was signed by the parties after several meetings with three of the four judges overseeing the coordination of more than of the current claims in the vioxx litigation 
the settlement agreement applies only to us legal residents and those who allege that their mi or is occurred in the united states 

table of contents as of october   the deadline for enrollment in the settlement program as defined below  more than  of the approximately  individuals who were eligible for the settlement program and whose claims were not dismissed  expected to be dismissed in the near future  or tolled claims that appear to have been abandoned had submitted some or all of the materials required for enrollment in the settlement program 
this represents approximately of the eligible mi and is claims previously registered with the settlement program 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  merck could exercise a right to walk away from the settlement agreement if the thresholds and other requirements were not met 
the company waived that right as of august  the waiver of that right triggered merck s obligation to pay a fixed total of billion 
payments will be made in installments into the settlement funds 
the first payment of million was made in august and an additional payment of million was made in october additional payments will be made on a periodic basis going forward  when and as needed to fund payments of claims and administrative expenses 
joint ventures the company has a number of joint ventures relating to its pharmaceutical and vaccines and infectious diseases segments 
pharmaceutical in  the company and schering plough corporation schering plough entered into agreements to create separate equally owned partnerships to develop and market in the united states new prescription medicines in the cholesterol management and respiratory therapeutic areas 
in december  the cholesterol management partnership agreements were expanded to include all the countries of the world  excluding japan 
in october  zetia ezetimibe marketed as ezetrol outside the united states  the first in a new class of cholesterol lowering agents  was launched in the united states 
in july  vytorin marketed as inegy outside the united states  a combination product containing the active ingredients of both zetia and zocor  was approved in the united states 
as previously disclosed  in january  the company announced the results of the effect of combination ezetimibe and high dose simvastatin vs 
simvastatin alone on the atherosclerotic process in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia enhance clinical trial  an imaging trial in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia  a rare genetic condition that causes very high levels of ldl bad cholesterol and greatly increases the risk for premature coronary artery disease 
as previously reported  despite the fact that ezetimibe simvastatin mg vytorin significantly lowered ldl bad cholesterol more than simvastatin mg alone  there was no significant difference between treatment with ezetimibe simvastatin and simvastatin alone on the pre specified primary endpoint  a change in the thickness of carotid artery walls over two years as measured by ultrasound 
there also were no significant differences between treatment with ezetimibe simvastatin and simvastatin on the four pre specified key secondary endpoints percent of patients manifesting regression in the average carotid artery intima media thickness ca imt  proportion of patients developing new carotid artery plaques mm  changes in the average maximum ca imt  and changes in the average ca imt plus in the average common femoral artery imt 
in enhance  when compared to simvastatin alone  ezetimibe simvastatin significantly lowered ldl bad cholesterol  as well as triglycerides and c reactive protein crp 
ezetimibe simvastatin is not indicated for the reduction of crp 
in the enhance study  the overall safety profile of ezetimibe simvastatin was generally consistent with the product label 
the enhance study was not designed nor powered to evaluate cardiovascular clinical events 
the improved reduction in high risk subjects presenting with acute coronary syndrome improve it trial is underway and is designed to provide cardiovascular outcomes data for ezetimibe simvastatin in patients with acute coronary syndrome 
no incremental benefit of ezetimibe simvastatin on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for simvastatin has been established 
in march  the results of enhance were reported at the annual scientific session of the american college of cardiology 
on july   efficacy and safety results from the simvastatin and ezetimibe in aortic stenosis seas study were announced 
seas was designed to evaluate whether intensive lipid lowering with vytorin mg would reduce the need for aortic valve replacement and the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality versus placebo in patients with asymptomatic mild to moderate aortic stenosis who had no indication for statin therapy 
vytorin failed to meet its primary end point for the reduction of major cardiovascular events 
there also was no significant difference in the key secondary end point of aortic valve events  however  there was a reduction in the group of patients taking vytorin compared to placebo in the key secondary end point of ischemic cardiovascular 
table of contents events 
vytorin is not indicated for the treatment of aortic stenosis 
no incremental benefit of vytorin on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for simvastatin has been established 
in the study  patients in the group who took vytorin mg had a higher incidence of cancer than the group who took placebo 
there was also a nonsignificant increase in deaths from cancer in patients in the group who took vytorin versus those who took placebo 
cancer and cancer deaths were distributed across all major organ systems 
the company believes the cancer finding in seas is likely to be an anomaly that  taken in light of all the available data  does not support an association with vytorin 
in august  the fda announced that it was investigating the results from the seas trial 
in this announcement  the fda also cited interim data from two large ongoing cardiovascular trials of vytorin the study of heart and renal protection sharp and the improve it clinical trials in which there was no increased risk of cancer with the combination of simvastatin plus ezetimibe 
the sharp trial is expected to be completed in the improve it trial is scheduled for completion around the fda determined that  as of that time  these findings in the seas trial plus the interim data from ongoing trials should not prompt patients to stop taking vytorin or any other cholesterol lowering drug 
the company  through merck schering plough pharmaceuticals the msp partnership  is committed to working with regulatory agencies to further evaluate the available data and interpretations of those data  however  the company does not believe that changes in the clinical use of vytorin are warranted 
as previously disclosed  the company and its joint venture partner  schering plough  have received several letters addressed to both companies from the house committee on energy and commerce  its subcommittee on oversight and investigations o i  and the ranking minority member of the senate finance committee  collectively seeking a combination of witness interviews  documents and information on a variety of issues related to the enhance clinical trial  the sale and promotion of vytorin  as well as sales of stock by corporate officers 
in addition  since august  the companies have received three additional letters from o i  including one dated february   seeking certain information and documents related to the seas clinical trial 
as previously disclosed  the companies have each received subpoenas from the new york and new jersey state attorneys general offices and a letter from the connecticut attorney general seeking similar information and documents 
in addition  the company has received five civil investigative demands cids from a multistate group of state attorneys general who are jointly investigating whether the companies violated state consumer protection laws when marketing vytorin 
finally  in september  the company received a letter from the civil division of the department of justice doj informing it that the doj is investigating whether the companies conduct relating to the promotion of vytorin caused false claims to be submitted to federal health care programs 
the company is cooperating with these investigations and working with schering plough to respond to the inquiries 
in addition  the company has become aware of or been served with approximately civil class action lawsuits alleging common law and state consumer fraud claims in connection with the msp partnership s sale and promotion of vytorin and zetia 
certain of those lawsuits allege personal injuries and or seek medical monitoring 
these actions  which have been filed in or transferred to federal court  are coordinated in a multidistrict litigation in the us district court for the district court of new jersey before district judge dennis m 
cavanaugh 
the parties are presently engaged in motions practice and briefing 
also  as previously disclosed  on april   a merck shareholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in federal court in the eastern district of pennsylvania alleging that merck and its chairman  president and chief executive officer  richard t 
clark  violated the federal securities laws 
on april   a member of a company employee retirement income security act erisa plan filed a putative class action lawsuit against the company and certain of its officers and directors alleging they breached their fiduciary duties under erisa 
in  the company entered into an agreement with astra ab astra to develop and market astra products in the united states 
in  the company and astra formed an equally owned joint venture that developed and marketed most of astra s new prescription medicines in the united states including prilosec omeprazole  the first in a class of medications known as proton pump inhibitors  which slows the production of acid from the cells of the stomach lining 
in  the company and astra restructured the joint venture whereby the company acquired astra s interest in the joint venture  renamed kbi inc kbi  and contributed kbi s operating assets to a new us limited partnership named astra pharmaceuticals  us the partnership  in exchange for a limited partner interest 
astra contributed the net assets of its wholly owned subsidiary  astra usa  inc  to the partnership in exchange for a 
table of contents general partner interest 
the partnership  renamed astrazeneca lp azlp upon astra s merger with zeneca group plc the astrazeneca merger  became the exclusive distributor of the products for which kbi retained rights 
the company earns certain partnership returns as well as ongoing revenue based on sales of current and future kbi products 
the partnership returns include a priority return provided for in the partnership agreement  variable returns based  in part  upon sales of certain former astra usa  inc products  and a preferential return representing the company s share of undistributed partnership gaap earnings 
the astrazeneca merger triggered a partial redemption in march of merck s interest in certain azlp product rights 
upon this redemption  merck received billion from azlp 
this amount was based primarily on a multiple of merck s average annual variable returns derived from sales of the former astra usa  inc products for the three years prior to the redemption the limited partner share of agreed value 
merck recorded a billion pretax gain on the partial redemption in the partial redemption of merck s interest in the product rights did not result in a change in merck s limited partner interest 
as described in item management s discussion and analysis below  after certain adjustments  the company recorded an aggregate pretax gain of billion 
in conjunction with the restructuring  astra purchased an option the asset option for a payment of million  which was recorded as deferred income  to buy merck s interest in the kbi products  excluding the gastrointestinal medicines nexium esomeprazole and prilosec the non ppi products 
the asset option is exercisable in the first half of at an exercise price equal to the net present value as of march  of projected future pretax revenue to be received by the company from the non ppi products the appraised value 
merck also had the right to require astra to purchase such interest in at the appraised value 
in february  the company advised azlp that it would not exercise the asset option  thus the million remains deferred 
in addition  in  the company granted astra an option the shares option to buy merck s common stock interest in kbi and  therefore  merck s interest in nexium and prilosec  exercisable two years after astra s exercise of the asset option 
astra can also exercise the shares option in or if combined annual sales of the two products fall below a minimum amount provided  in each case  only so long as astrazeneca s asset option has been exercised in the exercise price for the shares option is based on the net present value of estimated future net sales of nexium and prilosec as determined at the time of exercise  subject to certain true up mechanisms 
in  the company formed a joint venture with johnson johnson to develop and market a broad range of nonprescription medicines for us consumers 
this owned joint venture also includes canada 
significant joint venture products are pepcid ac famotidine  an over the counter form of the company s ulcer medication pepcid famotidine  as well as pepcid complete  an over the counter product which combines the company s ulcer medication with antacids calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide 
vaccines in  the company and pasteur m rieux connaught now sanofi pasteur sa formed a joint venture to market human vaccines in europe and to collaborate in the development of combination vaccines for distribution in the then existing eu and the european free trade association 
the company and sanofi pasteur contributed  among other things  their european vaccine businesses for equal shares in the joint venture  known as pasteur m rieux msd  snc now sanofi pasteur msd  snc the joint venture maintains a presence  directly or through affiliates or branches in belgium  italy  germany  spain  france  austria  ireland  sweden  portugal  the netherlands  switzerland and the united kingdom  and through distributors in the rest of its territory 
other in  the company and rh ne poulenc sa now sanofi aventis sa combined their respective animal health businesses to form merial limited merial  a fully integrated animal health company  which is a stand alone joint venture  owned by each party 
merial provides a comprehensive range of pharmaceuticals and vaccines to enhance the health  well being and performance of a wide range of animal species 
competition the markets in which the company conducts its business are highly competitive and often highly regulated 
global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and access 

table of contents such competition involves an intensive search for technological innovations and the ability to market these innovations effectively 
with its long standing emphasis on research and development  the company is well prepared to compete in the search for technological innovations 
additional resources to meet competition include quality control  flexibility to meet customer specifications  an efficient distribution system and a strong technical information service 
the company is active in acquiring and marketing products through joint ventures and licenses and has been refining its sales and marketing efforts to further address changing industry conditions 
to enhance its product portfolio  the company also continues to pursue external alliances 
however  the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product replacements  even for products protected by patents 
for example  the number of compounds available to treat diseases typically increases over time and has resulted in slowing the growth in sales of certain of the company s products 
legislation enacted in all states in the united states  particularly in the area of human pharmaceutical products  allows  encourages or  in a few instances  in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician  mandates the use of generic products those containing the same active chemical as an innovator s product rather than brand name products 
governmental and other pressures toward the dispensing of generic products have significantly reduced the sales of certain of the company s products no longer protected by patents  such as zocor  which lost market exclusivity in the us in and the company experienced a significant decline in zocor sales thereafter 
fosamax and fosamax plus d lost marketing exclusivity in the united states in as a result of these events  the company is experiencing significant declines in fosamax and fosamax plus d us sales 
also  trusopt and cosopt lost market exclusivity in the united states in october and as a result the company is experiencing a significant decline in sales of these products 
distribution the company sells its human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers  hospitals  government agencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions 
human health vaccines are sold primarily to physicians  wholesalers  physician distributors and government entities 
the company s professional representatives communicate the effectiveness  safety and value of the company s pharmaceutical and vaccine products to health care professionals in private practice  group practices and managed care organizations 
raw materials raw materials and supplies  which are generally available from multiple sources  are purchased worldwide and are normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of the company s pharmaceutical and vaccines and infectious diseases segments 
government regulation and investigation the pharmaceutical industry is subject to global regulation by regional  country  state and local agencies 
of particular importance is the fda in the united states  which administers requirements covering the testing  approval  safety  effectiveness  manufacturing  labeling and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals 
in many cases  the fda requirements have increased the amount of time and money necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the united states 
in  the food and drug administration modernization act the fda modernization act was passed and was the culmination of a comprehensive legislative reform effort designed to streamline regulatory procedures within the fda and to improve the regulation of drugs  medical devices and food 
the legislation was principally designed to ensure the timely availability of safe and effective drugs and biologics by expediting the premarket review process for new products 
a key provision of the legislation is the re authorization of the prescription drug user fee act of  which permits the continued collection of user fees from prescription drug manufacturers to augment fda resources earmarked for the review of human drug applications 
this helps provide the resources necessary to ensure the prompt approval of safe and effective new drugs 
in the united states  the government expanded health care access by enacting the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  which was signed into law in december prescription drug coverage began on january  this legislation supports the company s goal of improving access to medicines by expanding insurance coverage  while preserving market based incentives for pharmaceutical innovation 
at the same time  the legislation will ensure that prescription drug costs will be controlled by competitive pressures and by encouraging the appropriate use of medicines 
the us congress has considered  and may consider again  proposals to increase the government s role in pharmaceutical pricing in the medicare program 

table of contents these proposals may include removing the current legal prohibition against the secretary of the health and human services intervening in price negotiations between medicare drug benefit program plans and pharmaceutical companies 
they may also include mandating the payment of rebates for some or all of the pharmaceutical utilization in medicare drug benefit plans 
in addition  congress may again consider proposals to allow  under certain conditions  the importation of medicines from other countries 
for many years  the pharmaceutical industry has been under federal and state oversight with the approval process for new drugs  drug safety  advertising and promotion  drug purchasing and reimbursement programs and formularies variously under review 
the company believes that it will continue to be able to conduct its operations  including the introduction of new drugs to the market  in this regulatory environment 
one type of federal initiative to contain federal health care spending is the prospective or capitated payment system  first implemented to reduce the rate of growth in medicare reimbursement to hospitals 
such a system establishes in advance a flat rate for reimbursement for health care for those patients for whom the payor is fiscally responsible 
this type of payment system and other cost containment systems are now widely used by public and private payors and have caused hospitals  health maintenance organizations and other customers of the company to be more cost conscious in their treatment decisions  including decisions regarding the medicines to be made available to their patients 
the company continues to work with private and federal employers to slow increases in health care costs 
further  the company s efforts to demonstrate that its medicines can help save costs in other areas have encouraged the use of the company s medicines and have helped offset the effects of increasing cost pressures 
also  federal and state governments have pursued methods to directly reduce the cost of drugs and vaccines for which they pay 
for example  federal laws require the company to pay specified rebates for medicines reimbursed by medicaid  to provide discounts for outpatient medicines purchased by certain public health service entities and disproportionate share hospitals hospitals meeting certain criteria  and to provide minimum discounts of off of a defined non federal average manufacturer price for purchases by certain components of the federal government such as the department of veterans affairs and the department of defense 
initiatives in some states seek rebates beyond the minimum required by medicaid legislation  in some cases for patients beyond those who are eligible for medicaid 
under the federal vaccines for children entitlement program  the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc funds and purchases recommended pediatric vaccines at a public sector price for the immunization of medicaid eligible  uninsured  native american and certain underinsured children 
the company was awarded a cdc contract in for the supply of pediatric vaccines for the vaccines for children program 
as of january   patients previously eligible for medicaid who are also medicare beneficiaries years and older or disabled left the state administered medicaid system to be covered by the new medicare prescription drug benefit 
outside the united states  the company encounters similar regulatory and legislative issues in most of the countries where it does business 
there  too  the primary thrust of governmental inquiry and action is toward determining drug safety and effectiveness  often with mechanisms for controlling the prices of or reimbursement for prescription drugs and the profits of prescription drug companies 
the eu has adopted directives concerning the classification  labeling  advertising  wholesale distribution and approval for marketing of medicinal products for human use 
the company s policies and procedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives  consequently  it is believed that they will not have any material effect on the company s business 
in addition  certain countries within the eu  recognizing the economic importance of the research based pharmaceutical industry and the value of innovative medicines to society  are working with industry representatives to improve the competitive climate through a variety of means including market deregulation 
in january  the european commission ec launched a sector inquiry in the pharmaceutical markets under the rules of eu competition law 
as part of its inquiry  the company s offices in germany were inspected by the authorities in january the preliminary report of the ec was issued on november   in which the ec stated that it had confirmed its original hypothesis that competition in the pharmaceutical sector may be restricted or distorted  as indicated by a decline in innovation measured by the number of novel medicines reaching the market  and by alleged instances of delayed market entry of generic medicines 
the public consultation period with respect to the preliminary report expired on january   and the ec has issued further inquiries in respect of the subject of the investigation 
the ec has not alleged that the company or any of its subsidiaries have 
table of contents engaged in any unlawful practices 
the final report is planned for later in the company is cooperating with the ec in this sector inquiry 
the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies and is  therefore  subject to potential administrative actions 
such actions may include seizures of products and other civil and criminal sanctions 
under certain circumstances  the company on its own may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls 
the company believes that it should be able to compete effectively within this environment 
the company is subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally 
the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve  and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect directly the company s business  including recently enacted laws in a majority of us states requiring security breach notification 
patents  trademarks and licenses patent protection is considered  in the aggregate  to be of material importance in the company s marketing of human health products in the united states and in most major foreign markets 
patents may cover products per se  pharmaceutical formulations  processes for or intermediates useful in the manufacture of products or the uses of products 
protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the legal life of patents in the various countries 
the protection afforded  which may also vary from country to country  depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage 
the fda modernization act includes a pediatric exclusivity provision that may provide an additional six months of market exclusivity in the united states for indications of new or currently marketed drugs if certain agreed upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant 
these exclusivity provisions were re authorized by the prescription drug user fee act passed in september current us patent law provides additional patent term under patent term restoration for periods when the patented product was under regulatory review before the fda 
patent portfolios developed for products introduced by the company normally provide market exclusivity 
the company has the following key us patent protection including patent term restoration and pediatric exclusivity for major marketed products product year of expiration in us cancidas comvax cozaar crixivan compound formulation emend gardasil hyzaar invanz compound composition isentress januvia janumet compound salt maxalt compound other primaxin propecia recombivax rotateq with pending patent term restoration singulair zetia vytorin ezetimibe component in both products zolinza zostavax 
table of contents a basic patent is also in effect for sustiva stocrin 
bristol myers squibb company  under an exclusive license from the company  sells sustiva in the united states  canada and certain european countries 
the company markets stocrin in other countries throughout the world 
while the expiration of a product patent normally results in a loss of market exclusivity for the covered pharmaceutical product  commercial benefits may continue to be derived from i later granted patents on processes and intermediates related to the most economical method of manufacture of the active ingredient of such product  ii patents relating to the use of such product  iii patents relating to novel compositions and formulations  and iv in the united states and certain other countries  market exclusivity that may be available under relevant law 
the effect of product patent expiration on pharmaceutical products also depends upon many other factors such as the nature of the market and the position of the product in it  the growth of the market  the complexities and economics of the process for manufacture of the active ingredient of the product and the requirements of new drug provisions of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act or similar laws and regulations in other countries 
additions to market exclusivity are sought in the united states and other countries through all relevant laws  including laws increasing patent life 
some of the benefits of increases in patent life have been partially offset by a general increase in the number of incentives for and use of generic products 
additionally  improvements in intellectual property laws are sought in the united states and other countries through reform of patent and other relevant laws and implementation of international treaties 
for further information with respect to the company s patents  see patent litigation and risk factors below 
worldwide  all of the company s important products are sold under trademarks that are considered in the aggregate to be of material importance 
trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used  in other countries  as long as registered 
registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely 
royalties received during on patent and know how licenses and other rights amounted to million 
the company also paid royalties amounting to billion in under patent and know how licenses it holds 
research and development the company s business is characterized by the introduction of new products or new uses for existing products through a strong research and development program 
approximately  people are employed in the company s research activities 
research and development expenses were billion in  billion in and billion in the company maintains its ongoing commitment to research over a broad range of therapeutic areas and clinical development in support of new products 
the company maintains a number of long term exploratory and fundamental research programs in biology and chemistry as well as research programs directed toward product development 
merck s research and development model is designed to increase productivity and improve the probability of success by prioritizing the company s research and development resources on disease areas of unmet medical needs  scientific opportunity and commercial opportunity 
merck is managing its research and development portfolio across diverse approaches to discovery and development by balancing investments appropriately on novel  innovative targets with the potential to have a major impact on human health  on developing best in class approaches  and on delivering maximum value of the company s new medicines and vaccines through new indications and new formulations 
another important component of merck s science based diversification is based on expanding the company s portfolio of modalities to include not only small molecules and vaccines  but also biologics  peptides and rnai 
further  merck is moving to diversify its portfolio by creating a new division  merck bioventures  which leverages a unique platform for both follow on and novel biologics 
the company will continue to pursue appropriate external licensing opportunities 
during  the company began implementing a new model for its basic research global operating strategy 
the new model will align franchise and function through clear roles and responsibilities  align resources 
table of contents with disease area priorities and balance capacity across discovery phases and allow the company to act upon those programs with the highest probability of success 
additionally  the strategy is designed to expand the company s access to worldwide external science and incorporate external research as a key component of the company s early discovery pipeline in order to translate basic research productivity into late stage clinical success 
in the development of human health products  industry practice and government regulations in the united states and most foreign countries provide for the determination of effectiveness and safety of new chemical compounds through preclinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation 
before a new drug or vaccine may be marketed in the united states  recorded data on preclinical and clinical experience are included in the nda for a drug or the biologics license application bla for a vaccine submitted to the fda for the required approval 
once the company s scientists discover a new small molecule compound that they believe has promise to treat a medical condition  the company commences preclinical testing with that compound 
preclinical testing includes laboratory testing and animal safety studies to gather data on chemistry  pharmacology and toxicology 
pending acceptable preclinical data  the company will initiate clinical testing in accordance with established regulatory requirements 
the clinical testing begins with phase i studies  which are designed to assess safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics  and preliminary pharmacodynamic activity of the compound in humans 
if favorable  additional  larger phase ii studies are initiated to determine the efficacy of the compound in the affected population  define appropriate dosing for the compound  as well as identify any adverse effects that could limit the compound s usefulness 
if data from the phase ii trials are satisfactory  the company commences large scale phase iii trials to confirm the compound s efficacy and safety 
upon completion of those trials  if satisfactory  the company submits regulatory filings with the appropriate regulatory agencies around the world to have the product candidate approved for marketing 
there can be no assurance that a compound that is the result of any particular program will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for it to be marketed 
vaccine development follows the same general pathway as for drugs 
preclinical testing focuses on the vaccine s safety and ability to elicit a protective immune response immunogenicity 
pre marketing vaccine clinical trials are typically done in three phases 
initial phase i clinical studies are conducted in normal subjects to evaluate the safety  tolerability and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate 
phase ii studies are dose ranging studies and may enroll hundreds of subjects 
finally  phase iii trials typically enroll thousands of individuals and provide the necessary data on effectiveness and safety 
if successful  the company submits regulatory filings with the appropriate regulatory agencies 
also during this stage  the proposed manufacturing facility undergoes a pre approval inspection during which production of the vaccine as it is in progress is examined in detail 
in the united states  the fda review process begins once a complete nda is submitted and received by the fda 
pursuant to the prescription drug user fee act  the fda review period targets for ndas or supplemental ndas is either six months  for priority review  or ten months  for a standard review 
within days after receipt of an nda  the fda determines if the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review 
the fda also assesses  at that time  whether the application will be granted a priority review or standard review 
once the review timelines are defined  the fda will generally act upon the application within those timelines  unless a major amendment has been submitted either at the company s own initiative or the fda s request to the pending application 
if this occurs  the fda may extend the review period to allow for review of the new information  but by no more than days 
extensions to the review period are communicated to the company 
the fda can act on an application by issuing an approval letter or a complete response letter 
the company anticipates filing an nda with the fda in for mk  telcagepant  an investigational oral calcitonin gene related peptide receptor antagonist  which represents a new mechanism for the treatment of migraine and has demonstrated efficacy comparable to zolmitriptan  an effective triptan  in the phase iii clinical program 
the company also anticipates filing an nda with the fda in for mk  rolofylline  a potential first in class selective adenosine a antagonist  which is a phase iii investigational drug being evaluated for the treatment of acute heart failure 

table of contents additionally  the company anticipates filing an nda with the fda in for mk c  ezetimibe combined with atorvastatin  an investigational medication for the treatment of dyslipidemia being developed by the merck schering plough joint venture 
the company also anticipates regulatory action in on two supplemental filings that have been submitted to the fda one for gardasil  merck s hpv vaccine  for use in males  and one for isentress  a first in class integrase inhibitor for the treatment of hiv infection  for an expanded indication for use in treatment na ve patients 
in january  the company received a second complete response letter from fda regarding the supplemental bla sbla for the use of gardasil in women ages though the agency has completed its review of the response that merck provided in july and has recommended that merck submit additional data when the month study has been completed 
the initial sbla included data collected through an average of months from enrollment into the study  which is when the number of pre specified endpoints had been met 
following a review of the final results of the study  merck anticipates providing a response to the agency in the fourth quarter of the letter does not affect current indications for gardasil in females ages through nor does the letter relate to the sbla that was submitted in december for the use of gardasil in males 
in february  data on several phase iii isentress studies were presented at the th conference on retroviruses and opportunistic infections in montreal  canada 
in new subgroup analyses of a phase iii study startmrk that compared isentress to efavirenz one of the leading antiretrovirals prescribed for previously untreated treatment na ve hiv infected patients  isentress was found to be as effective as efavirenz at suppressing viral load and provided improvements in immune system function across a broad spectrum of patient subpopulations through weeks 
the use of isentress in previously untreated hiv infected patients is an investigational use of the drug 
both medicines were taken in combination with tenofovir emtricitabine 
in addition  results from two phase iii studies switchmrk and evaluating the effect of switching patients whose hiv is controlled on a lopinavir ritonavir based regimen to a regimen containing isentress tablets showed that isentress significantly improved total cholesterol  triglycerides and non hdl cholesterol 
the study also showed that isentress did not demonstrate non inferior virologic efficacy at maintaining viral load suppression 
as a result of the viral load findings in these trials  merck discontinued these two studies 
merck currently has nine products in phase iii development including mk and mk discussed above mk  deforolimus  is a novel mtor mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of cancer
