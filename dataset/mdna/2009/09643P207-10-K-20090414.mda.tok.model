the net assets were sold for million  including proceeds from the sale of overstock inventory of million 
of this amount  million was received at closing and a total of million was received subsequently in fiscal the sale resulted in a pre tax loss of million  which was recorded in administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings loss

the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship to net sales and the percentage increase or decrease of certain items included in our consolidated statements of earnings loss percentage increase decrease from prior period percentage of net sales fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal years ended january net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling administrative operating profit n m n m earnings from continuing operations n m n m n m percent change from the prior year is not meaningful in concluding on our performance 

return to top fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales net sales decreased million  or approximately  from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal the decrease is a result of a decline in sales in partylite s north american businesses and overall declines in sales in our wholesale and catalog internet segments 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales within partylite s international markets 
net sales direct selling segment net sales in the direct selling segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal partylite s us sales decreased approximately compared to the prior year  this decrease was driven by a decline in the number of sales consultants  which declined from over  as of january  to over  as of january   as well as fewer shows 
the reduction in sales consultants is partially the result of an increase in competition to attract and retain consultants due to more companies entering the direct selling channel 
additionally  the recent economic downturn in the us economy has led to lower consumer discretionary spending  which resulted in fewer shows and opportunities to promote our products and recruit new consultants 
we have been initiating new and expanded means to maintain our consultant count such as increased training and promotional initiatives 
partylite canada reported an approximately decrease compared to the prior year in us dollars  or on a local currency basis 
the sales decrease in canada is primarily due to the decrease in its consultant base 
in partylite s european markets  sales increased approximately in us dollars  driven by strong sales in the newer markets  an increase of about  consultants and favorable foreign currency translation 
on a local currency basis  partylite europe sales increased approximately 
partylite europe represented approximately of partylite s worldwide net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal  reflecting the continued sales growth 
net sales in the direct selling segment represented approximately of total blyth net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal net sales catalog internet segment net sales in the catalog internet segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease is due to lower consumer discretionary spending  as well as order processing difficulties associated with the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning erp system 
net sales in the catalog internet segment accounted for approximately of total blyth net sales in fiscal and net sales wholesale segment net sales in the wholesale segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease is a result of reduced sales within our home d cor and seasonal decor product lines  which were adversely impacted by the weak housing market 
in addition  sales were negatively impacted by million  as a result of the 
return to top sale of our mass channel candle business  which occurred at the end of the first quarter of fiscal net sales in the wholesale segment represented approximately of total blyth net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal consolidated gross profit and operating expenses blyth s consolidated gross profit decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to the decrease in sales  partially offset by efforts to control costs including reductions in workforce within the manufacturing and distribution operations and renegotiations of certain vendor and supplier contracts 
the gross profit margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase from prior year is due in part to nonrecurring charges of million  or  relating to severance  inventory write downs and asset impairments in connection with the sale of bhi na during fiscal the balance of this increase was primarily due to the absence of bhi na sales in fiscal since bhi na operated at lower margins than blyth s other businesses in the prior year 
blyth s consolidated selling expense decreased million  or approximately  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in selling expense relates to the reduced sales in partylite us from million is fiscal to million in fiscal and the wholesale and catalog internet segments 
offsetting the impact in reduced sales are strategic initiatives undertaken by partylite to increase sales 
these initiatives include various independent consultant promotional programs aimed at increasing sales and recruiting new consultants 
selling expense as a percentage of net sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal overall  the increase in selling expense as a percent of sales is primarily a result of sales decreasing at a greater rate than selling expenses 
blyth consolidated administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decline was principally due to severance related charges million and the termination of an office lease million taken during fiscal associated with the sale of bhi na  as well as improved expense management on a year over year basis 
administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were approximately for fiscal and for fiscal impairment charges of million for goodwill and other intangibles were recognized in the catalog internet segment in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal in both years we reviewed the performance of the miles kimball business and its projected outlook 
the miles kimball business experienced lower revenue growth and reduced operating margins than anticipated during both fiscal and this shortfall in revenues and profit was primarily attributable to decreased consumer spending due to changes in the business environment  an overall weak economic climate and higher postage  paper and printing costs 
as a result  the goodwill and intangibles in the catalog internet segment were determined to be impaired in fiscal and further impaired in fiscal blyth s consolidated operating profit decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in sales partially offset by a corresponding decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of initiatives to maintain sales  as well as severance incurred due to reductions in personnel 

return to top operating profit direct selling segment operating profit in the direct selling segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in sales for partylite s north american operations and increased promotional costs of million 
partially offsetting this decline was an improvement in sales within partylite europe  including the positive effects of stronger foreign currencies 
operating loss catalog internet segment operating loss in the catalog internet segment increased by million  from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal this increased loss was primarily due to the issues associated with the implementation of the new erp at the miles kimball company and continued lower consumer spending resulting from the weakening economy 
operating losses for fiscal and included goodwill and other intangibles impairments charges of million and million  respectively 
partially offsetting these charges were a reduction in losses at the boca java company of million  excluding the million goodwill impairment 
operating loss wholesale segment operating loss in the wholesale segment decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this reduction is primarily the result of the sale of the bhi na business in fiscal  which had contributed million in operating losses in the prior year  improving operating income this year by million 
this was partially offset by lower sales and profit across the segment due to a soft housing market and weakening economy 
consolidated other expense income interest expense decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in outstanding debt 
interest income decreased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  mainly due to lower amounts of cash and short term investments and lower interest rates during fiscal foreign exchange and other losses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the loss in fiscal includes a million impairment charge related to an available for sale equity investment in redenvelope  inc and a million impairment charge on an australian joint venture investment accounted for under the equity method 
the loss recorded in fiscal includes million for the permanent impairment of our investment in redenvelope and an unrealized loss of million related to our preferred stock portfolio that are classified as trading investments 
income tax expense decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to a pretax loss in the united states 
this decrease was offset by continued strong foreign sourced earnings as well as the tax impact of the non deductible portion of goodwill and other intangible impairments and impairments of investments for which no tax benefit was recorded 
the effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to a negative for the current year as result of our net loss 
the current year rate reflects the strong foreign sourced earnings offset in part by the pretax loss in the united states and the partial benefit taken on the goodwill and intangible impairments in the catalog and internet segment 

return to top as a result of the foregoing  earnings from continuing operations decreased million  from million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal basic earnings per share from continuing operations were for fiscal compared to a loss of for fiscal diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were for fiscal compared to a loss of for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales net sales decreased million  or approximately  from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal the decrease is a result of lower wholesale sales of million due to the sale of bhi na mass channel candle business in our wholesale segment and a decrease in partylite s us sales of million 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales within both partylite s european and canadian operations and the catalog internet segment 
net sales direct selling segment net sales in the direct selling segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal partylite s us sales decreased approximately compared to prior year 
management believes this sales decrease was driven by a decline in the number of sales consultants as a result of increased channel competition  as well as fewer shows per consultant 
partylite canada reported an approximately increase compared to the prior year in us dollars  or on a local currency basis 
sales in canada increased due to a higher number of guests per show and shows per consultant 
in partylite s european markets  sales increased approximately in us dollars  driven by strong sales in the newer markets and favorable foreign currency translation 
on a local currency basis  partylite europe sales increased approximately 
partylite europe represented approximately of partylite s worldwide net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal net sales in the direct selling segment represented approximately of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal net sales catalog internet segment net sales in the catalog internet segment increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was due to increased sales in our miles kimball and easy comforts catalogs and sales growth in boca java 
net sales in the catalog internet segment accounted for approximately of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal net sales wholesale segment net sales in the wholesale segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was a result of lower mass candle sales due to the sale of the bhi na business  as well as reduced sales in our home d cor channel  which was adversely impacted by the weak housing market 
partially offsetting these declines 
return to top was an increase in sales for the sterno business of approximately and in the seasonal d cor business of 
net sales in the wholesale segment represented approximately of total blyth net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal consolidated gross profit and operating expenses blyth s consolidated gross profit increased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percent of sales  gross margin was in fiscal and in fiscal  an increase of 
this increase was principally related to the following factors a reduction of severance  inventory write downs and asset impairments related to bhi na  or  improvements at partylite largely due to selected price increases  reduced shipping and handling costs and favorable product mix  or  and improvements in the wholesale businesses  mostly due to the sale of bhi na in the first quarter of fiscal whose gross margins are significantly lower than our other businesses  as well as improvements in our other wholesale businesses resulting from selected price increases  better cost control and favorable product mix  or 
partially offsetting these increases were higher commodities costs  primarily in wax and other chemicals  which decreased gross profit margin by 
blyth s consolidated selling expense decreased million  or approximately  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in selling expense relates to reduced sales resulting from the sale of bhi na late in the first quarter of fiscal million in sales in fiscal compared to million in fiscal 
selling expense decreased by million as a result of the sale of bhi na 
selling expense as a percentage of net sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal since bhi na had a very low ratio of selling expense to net sales 
partylite s selling expense was flat since partylite europe s increased sales were offset by partylite us s reduced selling expense  which was consistent with the overall sales trends in these businesses 
blyth consolidated administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in administrative expenses was primarily due to severance charges and an impairment of a lease and other fixed asset impairments related to the sale of bhi na  partially offset in fiscal and by million and million  respectively  of collections of notes receivable which had previously been reserved for as part of the gies sale 
administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were approximately for fiscal and for fiscal impairment charges for goodwill of million were recognized in the wholesale segment in fiscal impairment charges of million for goodwill and other intangibles were recognized in the catalog internet segment in fiscal the amount recorded in fiscal was the result of our decision to discontinue the sales of a new sterno product  rising commodity costs and a continued decline in operating performance in the sterno reporting unit and a business restructuring which resulted in a significantly changed near term outlook of the business in the wholesale premium reporting unit 
in fiscal  as part of our annual impairment review  we assessed the recent performance of the miles kimball business and its fiscal outlook 
the miles kimball business experienced lower revenue growth than anticipated and reduced operating margins due to higher postage  paper and printing costs 
this shortfall was primarily attributable to decreased consumer spending due to changes in the catalog internet business environment and an overall weak economic climate 
as a result  the goodwill and intangibles in the catalog internet segment was determined to be impaired 

return to top blyth s consolidated operating profit increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to higher profits within the direct selling segment  in particular for partylite europe and canada  and reduced operating losses within the wholesale segment 
operating profit direct selling segment operating profit in the direct selling segment increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the impact of increased sales within partylite europe and canada  including the effects of stronger foreign currencies  partially offset by reduced sales for partylite us and continued cost increases for wax and other commodities 
operating profit loss catalog internet segment operating loss in the catalog internet segment increased by million  from a profit of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal this profit decline was primarily due to the impairment charge for goodwill and other intangible assets of million related to the miles kimball business unit  higher postage  paper and printing costs within the miles kimball business and an increase in selling expense of million at boca java  primarily related to sales promotions 
operating loss wholesale segment operating loss in the wholesale segment decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal included in the loss for fiscal was the previously mentioned goodwill impairment charge of million 
also contributing to the improvement for fiscal was increased operating profit at sterno and midwest of cannon falls businesses  totaling million 
consolidated other expense income interest expense decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in outstanding debt 
interest income increased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  mainly due to higher amounts of cash and short term investments held during fiscal foreign exchange and other reported income of million in fiscal compared to a loss of million in fiscal the loss of million in fiscal includes a million impairment charge related to an available for sale equity investment in redenvelope  inc  whose decline in value was deemed other than temporary and a million impairment charge on an australian joint venture investment accounted for under the equity method 
partially offsetting these charges in fiscal were foreign exchange gains and other income of million 
income tax expense increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the increase in profit before tax and the increase in our tax reserves for ongoing tax audits 
this increase was offset by continued strong foreign sourced earnings  which are taxed at a lower rate than u 
s earnings 
the offsets led to a slight decrease in the effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal 
return to top as a result of the foregoing  earnings from continuing operations increased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal basic earnings per share from continuing operations were for fiscal compared to for fiscal diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were for fiscal compared to for fiscal the loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  for fiscal was million  or per diluted share 
the loss includes a a non tax deductible loss of million on the sale of the kaemingk business  b a non tax deductible loss on the sale of the edelman and euro decor businesses of million  which includes a goodwill impairment charge of million  c a net of tax loss on the sale of the gies business of million  which includes an impairment charge of million and d net of tax loss on sale of the colony business of million  which includes an impairment charge of million 
the loss from discontinued operations includes an operating loss  net of tax  of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal there were no discontinued operations during fiscal seasonality historically  our operating cash flow for the first nine months of the fiscal year shows a utilization of cash  due to requirements for meeting working capital needs for inventory purchases and the extension of credit through the holiday season 
our fourth quarter  however  historically generated a surplus of cash resulting from a large concentration of our business occurring during the fourth quarter holiday season 
liquidity and capital resources we recognize that the cash provided by operations of million in fiscal is significantly lower than the million in the prior year 
however  we are addressing this matter in the following ways 
first  we have begun to execute an aggressive working capital management program designed to conserve cash 
second  we will continue to focus on cost cutting measures throughout the company with the goal to save cash 
third  we will consider the timing and level of future dividends and treasury share buybacks 
fourth  we have long term investments on our balance sheet that we could convert into cash should the need arise 
these initiatives will support our expectation that we will be able to fund our working capital requirements in the foreseeable future from operational cash flows 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million from million at january  to million at january  we have limited our decrease in cash by liquidating some of our investments and reducing our share repurchases during fiscal we typically generate positive cash flow from operations due to favorable gross margins and the variable nature of selling expenses  which constitute a significant percentage of operating expenses 
we generated million in cash from operations in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decline was largely due to the reduction in net earnings 
operating profit decreased million to million primarily due to lower sales  increased commodity and shipping costs and selling expense as a percentage of sales 
included in earnings from continuing operations were non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  goodwill and other intangible impairments and amortization of unearned stock based compensation of million  million and million  respectively 
net changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a use of cash of million 
due to the seasonal nature of our businesses we generally do not have positive cash flow from operations 
return to top until our fourth quarter 
our working capital needs are the highest in late summer prior to the start of the holiday season 
if demand for our products falls short of expectations this could require us to maintain higher inventory balances than forecasted and could negatively impact our liquidity 
additionally  the existing credit crisis may also negatively impact the ability of our customers to obtain credit and consequently could negatively impact our sales and the collection of our receivables 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to a use of cash of million in fiscal our investments decreased from million as of january  to million at january  net capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal during fiscal we received proceeds from the sale of certain assets and liabilities of the bhi na business of million and proceeds from the sale of one of our european wholesale discontinued operations of million compared to a use of cash of million in the current year to obtain our interest in visalus and certain assets of as we change 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million which included the reduction of our long term debt and capital lease obligations by million  compared to long term debt and capital lease payments of million in the prior year 
we also purchased treasury stock of million and paid dividends of million 
our senior notes  with a remaining principal amount of million as of january   are due on october  we anticipate the ability to repay these notes using existing cash balances as well as expected cash flows from operations 
we will continue to carefully monitor our cash position  and will only make additional repurchases of outstanding debt or shares and will only pay dividends when we have sufficient cash surpluses available for us to do so 
the primary factor impacting our operating cash flow in fiscal is the decrease in partylite sales in the us market of million  which was driven by fewer active independent sales consultants  as well as lower activity by existing consultants and reduced sales per show resulting from difficult economic conditions that made booking and holding shows more challenging 
management s key areas of focus include stabilizing the consultant base through training and promotional incentives  which has resulted in an increase in our selling expense during fiscal partylite s active independent sales consultants have declined in recent years  primarily in the united states 
in the united states  the number of active independent sales consultants has declined from over  at the end of fiscal to over  at the end of fiscal while we are making efforts to stabilize and increase the number of active independent sales consultants  it may be difficult to do so in the current economic climate due to reduced consumer discretionary spending 
if our us consultant count continues to decline it will have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial results 
in addition  our operating cash flow is impacted by decreased sales within the wholesale and catalog internet segments 
sales within our wholesale segment have declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and sales in our catalog internet segment have declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal furthermore  we expect that the current recession  with a decline in consumer spending and its negative impact on sales  to continue 
if the current recession is prolonged and or the actions already initiated by management are not successful in improving the operating performances of our businesses  it may become necessary to undertake additional measures to preserve our liquidity 
these initiatives could include additional dispositions  overhead cost reductions  lower levels of in stock inventory and reduced promotional activities 
we anticipate total capital spending of approximately million for fiscal  or about million less than our net expenditures in fiscal year  due to our plans to invest in only 
return to top necessary updates and repairs and only investing capital where significant returns are provided with minimal risk 
our focus is on improving our information technology systems 
we have grown in part through acquisitions and  as part of our growth strategy  we expect to continue from time to time in the ordinary course of business to evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities as appropriate 
we believe our financing needs in the short and long term can be met from cash generated internally 
information on debt maturities is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
on october   we acquired a interest in visalus for million and incurred acquisition costs of million for a total cash acquisition cost of million 
we intend to and may be required to purchase additional interests in visalus that will require additional capital resources  increasing our ownership to 
the requirement for additional purchases is conditioned upon visalus meeting certain operating targets in fiscal  and  subject to a one time  one year extension 
we have the option to acquire the remaining interest in visalus even if they do not meet these operating targets 
if visalus meets its current projected operating targets  the total expected redemption value of the noncontrolling interest will be approximately million over fiscal  and the purchase prices of the additional investments are equal to a multiple of visalus s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  exclusive of certain extraordinary items 
the payment  if any  will be out of existing cash balances and expected future cash flows from operations 
in october  we executed amendment no 
to our unsecured revolving credit facility credit facility dated as of june  the amendment provided for borrowing under the credit facility of million  contingent upon the adherence to predefined covenants 
as a result of noncompliance with two of the covenants we terminated the credit facility on december   after providing cash collateral to the issuing bank such that all standby letters of credit are fully satisfied and are no longer considered outstanding under the credit facility 
united states and global credit and equity markets have recently undergone significant disruption  making it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms 
in addition  equity markets are continuing to experience rapid and wide fluctuations in value 
if these conditions continue or worsen  our cost of borrowing may increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our businesses 
in addition  our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies 
a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing 
obtaining a new credit facility will more than likely require higher interest costs and may require our providing security to guarantee such borrowings 
alternatively  we may not be able to obtain unfunded borrowings  which may require us to seek other forms of financing  such as term debt  at higher interest rates and additional expense 
in addition  if the economic conditions continue to worsen  we may be subject to future impairments of our assets  including accounts receivable  inventories  property  plant and equipment  investments  goodwill and other intangibles  if the valuation of these assets or businesses continues to decline 
as of january   we had a total of million available under an uncommitted facility with bank of america to be used for letters of credit through january  as of january   no letters of credit were outstanding under this facility 
in may  we filed a shelf registration statement for the issuance of up to million in debt securities with the securities and exchange commission 
on september   we issued million of senior notes due october  at a discount of approximately million  which is being amortized over the life of the notes 
in fiscal and  we

interest is payable semi annually in arrears on april and october on october   we issued million senior notes due on november  at a discount of approximately million  which is being amortized over the life of the notes 
such notes contain provisions and restrictions similar to those in the senior notes 
as of january   we were in compliance with such provisions 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears on may and november the notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at a specified redemption price 
the proceeds of the debt issuances were used for general corporate purposes 
as of january  and  miles kimball had approximately million and million  respectively  of long term debt including current portion outstanding under a real estate mortgage note payable  which matures on june  under the terms of the note  payments of principal and interest are required monthly at a fixed interest rate of 
as of january  and  cbk had million  of long term debt outstanding under an industrial revenue bond irb  which matures on january  the bond is backed by an irrevocable letter of credit 
the loan is collateralized by certain of cbk s assets 
the amount outstanding under the irb bears interest at short term floating rates  which on a weighted average was as of january  interest payments are required monthly and the principal is due upon maturity 
the estimated fair value of our million and million total long term debt including current portion at january  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value is determined by quoted market prices  where available  and from analyses performed by investment bankers using current interest rates considering our credit rating and the remaining terms to maturity 
the following table summarizes the maturity dates of our contractual obligations as of january  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations in thousands total year years years years long term debt capital leases interest purchase obligations operating leases unrecognized tax benefits total contractual obligations long term debt includes senior notes due october   senior notes due november   a mortgage note payable maturity june   and an industrial revenue bond irb with a maturity date of january  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
amounts represent future lease payments  excluding interest  due on five capital leases  which end between fiscal and fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense on long term debt is comprised of million relating to senior notes  million in mortgage interest  thousand of interest due on the cbk industrial revenue bond and approximately thousand of interest relating to future capital lease obligations 
purchase obligations consist primarily of open purchase orders for inventory 
unrecognized tax benefits consist of million which is expected to be realized within the next months  and million for which we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the potential future payments see note to the consolidated financial statements 

return to top since january   we have purchased  shares on the open market  for a cost of million  bringing the cumulative total purchased shares to  as of january   for a total cost of approximately million 
additionally in fiscal   shares were repurchased through a dutch auction cash tender offer for an aggregate purchase price of million  including fees and expenses 
the acquired shares are held as common stock in treasury at cost 
on april   we declared a cash dividend of per share of common stock 
the dividend will be payable to shareholders of record as of may  and will be paid on may  our ability to pay cash dividends in the future is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to operate profitably and to generate significant cash flows from operations in excess of investment and financing requirements that may increase in the future to  for example  fund new acquisitions or retire debt 
as we normally do  we will review our dividend policy prior to our next dividend payment historically we have paid dividends in may and november  and may adjust the rate of our semi annual dividend if necessary 
during fiscal we paid a total of million in dividends 
we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to a have a material current or future effect upon our financial statements 
we do not utilize derivatives for trading purposes 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  restructuring and impairments  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following are our critical accounting policies and methods 
revenue recognition revenues consist of sales to customers  net of returns and allowances 
we recognize revenue upon delivery  when both title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer 
we present revenues net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities 
generally  our sales are based on fixed prices from published price lists 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs  which may include special pricing agreements for specific customers  volume incentives and other promotions 
should market conditions decline  we may increase customer incentives with respect to future sales 
we also record reductions to revenue  based primarily on historical experience  for estimated customer returns and chargebacks that may arise as a result of shipping errors  product damage in transit or for other reasons that can only become known subsequent to recognizing the revenue 
if the amount of 
return to top actual customer returns and chargebacks were to increase significantly from the estimated amount  revisions to the estimated allowance would be required 
in some instances  we receive payment in advance of product delivery 
such advance payments occur primarily in our direct selling and direct marketing channels and are recorded as deferred revenue in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets 
upon delivery of product for which advance payment has been made  the related deferred revenue is reversed and recorded as revenue 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for trade and note receivables 
the allowance is determined based on our evaluation of specific customers ability to pay  aging of receivables  historical experience and the current economic environment 
while we believe we have appropriately considered known or expected outcomes  our customers ability to pay their obligations  including those to us  could be adversely affected by declining retail sales resulting from such factors as contraction in the economy or a general decline in consumer spending 
some of our wholesale business units offer seasonal dating programs pursuant to which customers that qualify for such programs are offered extended payment terms for seasonal product shipments  which is a common practice in some of our channels 
the sales price for our products sold pursuant to such seasonal dating programs is fixed prior to the time of shipment to the customer 
customers do not have the right to return product  except for rights to return that we believe are typical of our industry for such reasons as damaged goods  shipping errors or similar occurrences 
we are not required to repurchase products from our customers  nor do we have any regular practice of doing so 
we believe that we are reasonably assured of payment for products sold pursuant to such seasonal dating programs based on our historical experience with the established list of customers eligible for such programs 
if  however  product sales by our customers during the seasonal selling period should fall significantly below expectations  such customers financial condition could be adversely affected  increasing the risk of not collecting these seasonal dating receivables and  possibly  resulting in additional bad debt charges 
we do not make any sales under consignment or similar arrangements 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolete  excess and unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions  customer planograms and sales forecasts 
if market acceptance of our existing products or the successful introduction of new products should significantly decrease  additional inventory write downs could be required 
potential additional inventory write downs could result from unanticipated additional quantities of obsolete finished goods and raw materials  and or from lower disposition values offered by the parties who normally purchase surplus inventories 
restructuring and impairment charges on long lived assets in response to changing market conditions and competition  our management regularly updates our business model and market strategies  including the evaluation of facilities  personnel and products 
future adverse changes in economic and market conditions could result in additional organizational changes and possibly additional restructuring and impairment charges 
historically  we have reviewed long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and other intangibles with definite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of such an asset might not be recoverable 
management determines whether there has been a permanent impairment on long lived assets held for use in the business by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flow from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying value of the asset 
the amount 
return to top of any resulting impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying value to the fair value  which may be estimated using the present value of the same cash flows 
long lived assets that meet the definition of held for sale are valued at the lower of carrying amount or net realizable value 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles are subject to an assessment for impairment using a two step fair value based test and such other intangibles are also subject to impairment reviews  which must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles might be impaired 
we perform our annual assessment of impairment as of january  which is our fiscal year end date  or as deemed necessary 
for goodwill  the first step is to identify whether a potential impairment exists 
this first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
fair value for each of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a combination of valuation techniques  namely the discounted cash flow methodology and the market multiple methodology 
the fair value of the reporting units is derived by calculating the average of the outcome of the two valuation techniques 
the discounted cash flow methodology assumes the fair value of an asset can be estimated by the economic benefit or net cash flows the asset will generate over the life of the asset  discounted to its present value 
the discounting process uses a rate of return that accounts for both the time value of money and the investment risk factors 
the market multiple methodology estimates fair value based on what other participants in the market have recently paid for reasonably similar assets 
adjustments are made to compensate for differences between the reasonably similar assets and the assets being valued 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  no further analysis is necessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed 
the second step compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to the estimated fair value of the goodwill 
if fair value is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is reported as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense 
our assumptions in the discounted cash flow methodology used to support recoverability include the reporting unit s five year business outlook 
the business outlook is a five year projection of the business unit s financial performance 
the business outlook includes the cash expected to be generated from the reporting unit based on certain assumptions for revenue growth  capital spending and profit margins 
this serves as the basis for the discounted cash flow model in determining fair value 
additionally  the discount rate utilized in the cash flow model values the reporting unit to its net present value taking into consideration the time value of money  other investment risk factors and the terminal value of the business 
for the terminal value  we used a multiple of earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiplied by a certain factor for which an independent third party would pay for a similar business in an arms length transaction 
in determining this factor we used information that was available for similar transactions executed in the marketplace 
the multiple of ebitda used contemplates  among other things  the expected revenue growth of the business  which in turn would require the use of a higher ebitda multiple if revenue were expected to grow at a higher rate than normal 
the following circumstances could impact our cash flow and cause further impairments to reported goodwill unexpected increase in competition resulting in lower prices or lower volumes  entry of new products into the marketplace from competitors  lack of acceptance of our new products into the marketplace  loss of a key employee or customer  significantly higher raw material costs  and macroeconomic factors 

return to top miles kimball as a result of our january  annual impairment assessment  we determined that the goodwill related to the miles kimball reporting unit  in the catalog internet segment  was impaired 
in fiscal  the miles kimball business experienced lower revenue growth than anticipated when compared to the fiscal budget 
we believe this shortfall in performance was primarily attributable to decreased consumer spending due to changes in the business environment and adverse economic conditions that were prevailing during the later part of fiscal as a result of this analysis  the goodwill in this reporting unit was determined to be impaired  as the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  the miles kimball company continued to experience substantial declines in operating performance when compared to prior years results and its strategic outlook 
we believe this shortfall in performance was primarily attributable to decreased consumer spending due to changes in the business environment and adverse economic conditions 
as a result of the impairment analysis performed  the goodwill was determined to be fully impaired  as the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value  including goodwill 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million  which included the million related to as we change  during the third quarter of fiscal the table below is a summary of estimated fair values as of january  and october  and the assumptions used in comparison to the carrying values in assessing recoverability of goodwill for the miles kimball reporting unit of the catalog internet segment 
s in millions january  october  estimated fair value recorded carrying value of assets excess impaired value to recorded value assumptions and other information discount rate average revenue growth rate tax rate terminal multiple of ebitda capital expenditures goodwill at risk other long lived assets at risk as a result of the reduced near term outlook and the changing business environment  the terminal multiple of ebitda was reduced from to the change in this assumption reflects the continued changes in the business environment and adverse business conditions we are currently experiencing due to decreased consumer spending 
management believes the adverse conditions currently being experienced are not temporary  but rather reflect the additional risk in the marketplace as a result of additional economic and pricing pressures 

return to top other in august  we acquired a interest in boca java  a small gourmet coffee and tea company 
boca java sells its products primarily through the internet and is included in the catalog internet segment 
boca java represents a separate reporting unit and is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis 
we completed an impairment assessment as of october  which indicated that the goodwill of million was fully impaired and recorded a charge to write off the goodwill 
our direct selling segment had approximately million of goodwill as of january  with the addition of visalus in the third quarter of fiscal goodwill increased by approximately million  to million  as of january  the january  impairment assessment of this segment indicates that the goodwill is fully recoverable 
significant assumptions if actual revenue growth  profit margins  costs and capital spending should differ significantly from the assumptions included in our business outlook used in the cash flow models  the reporting unit s fair value could fall significantly below expectations and additional impairment charges could be required to write down goodwill to its fair value and  if necessary  other long lived assets could be subject to a similar fair value test and possible impairment 
long lived assets represent primarily fixed assets and other long term assets excluding goodwill and other intangibles 
there are two main assumptions that are used for the discounted cash flow analysis first  the discount rate and second the terminal multiple 
this discount rate is used to value the gross cash flows expected to be derived from the business to its net present value 
the discount rate uses a rate of return to account for the time value of money and an investment risk factor 
for the terminal multiple  we used ebitda multiplied by a factor for which an independent third party would pay for a similar business in an arms length transaction 
in determining this factor we used information that was available for similar transactions executed in the marketplace 
the multiple of ebitda used contemplates  among other things  the expected revenue growth of the business which in turn would require the use of a higher ebitda multiple if revenue were expected to grow at a higher rate than normal 
a change in the discount rate is often used by management to alter or temper the discounted cash flow model if there is a higher degree of risk that the business outlook objectives might not be achieved 
these risks are often based upon the business units past performance  competition  confidence in the business unit management  position in the marketplace  acceptance of new products in the marketplace and other macro and microeconomic factors surrounding the business 
if management believes there is additional risk associated with the business outlook it will adjust the discount rate and terminal value accordingly 
the terminal value is generally a multiple of ebitda and is discounted to its net present value using the discount rate 
capital expenditures are included and are consistent with the historical business trend plus any known significant expenditures 
trade names and trademarks our trade name and trademark intangible assets related to our acquisitions of miles kimball and walter drake reported in the catalog internet segment and our acquisition of a controlling interest in visalus in october reported in the direct selling segment 
we had approximately million and million in trade names and trademarks as of january  and  respectively 

return to top we perform our annual assessment of impairment for indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  which is our fiscal year end  or upon the occurrence of a triggering event 
we use the relief from royalty method to estimate the fair value for indefinite lived intangible assets 
the underlying concept of the relief from royalty method is that the inherent economic value of intangibles is directly related to the timing of future cash flows associated with the intangible asset 
similar to the income approach or discounted cash flow methodology used to determine the fair value of goodwill  the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is equal to the present value of after tax cash flows associated with the intangible asset based on an applicable royalty rate 
the royalty rate is determined by using existing market comparables for royalty agreements using an intellectual property data base 
the arms length agreements generally support a rate that is a percentage of direct sales 
this approach is based on the premise that the free cash flow is a more valid criterion for measuring value than book or accounting profits 
as a result of our fiscal and impairment assessments  we determined that the recorded values of trade names and trademarks in the miles kimball reporting unit  in the catalog internet segment  were impaired 
in fiscal  the miles kimball business experienced lower revenue growth than anticipated when compared to the fiscal budget and forecasts 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal we performed additional impairment assessments due to changes in the business environment and adverse economic conditions currently experienced due to the continued decrease in consumer spending 
as a result of these impairment analyses performed  the trade names and trademarks in this reporting unit were determined to be impaired  as their fair value was less than their carrying value 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash pre tax impairment charge of million in fiscal  and million and million in the third and fourth quarters  respectively of fiscal the trade names associated with visalus were not found to be impaired as of january  the two primary assumptions used in the relief from royalty method are the discount rate and the royalty rate 
this discount rate is used to value the expected net cash flows to be derived from the royalty to its net present value 
the discount rate uses a rate of return to account for the time value of money and an investment risk factor 
the royalty rate is based upon past royalty performance as well as the expected royalty growth rate using both macro and microeconomic factors surrounding the business 
a change in the discount rate is often used by management to alter or temper the discounted cash flow analysis if there is a higher degree of risk that the estimated cash flows from the indefinite lived intangible asset may not be fully achieved 
these risks are often based upon the business units past performance  competition  position in the marketplace  acceptance of new products in the marketplace and other macro and microeconomic factors surrounding the business 
if  however  actual cash flows should fall significantly below expectations  this could result in an impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
if  as of january   the discount rate would have increased by and the royalty rate would have decreased by half of one percent  the fair value of the catalog internet trade names and trademarks would have decreased by million to million 
this decrease would have required us to take an additional impairment charge of million to write down our indefinite lived intangibles to its estimated fair value 
conversely  if the discount rate would have decreased by and the royalty rate would have increased by half of one percent  the fair value of the catalog internet trade names and trademarks would have increased by million  resulting in no impairment charge 

return to top accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure state  federal and foreign  together with assessing permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing bases and treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as the carrying value of intangibles  deductibility of expenses  depreciation of property and equipment  and valuation of inventories 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods 
to the extent we determine the need to establish a valuation allowance or increase such allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings loss 
management periodically estimates our probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business 
the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits  as well as changes to or further interpretations of regulations 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that the tax rate may increase or decrease in any period 
amounts accrued for the tax uncertainties  primarily recorded in long term liabilities  total million and million at january  and  respectively 
accruals relate to tax issues for us federal  domestic state and taxation of foreign earnings 
during fiscal and  we determined that a portion of our fiscal and undistributed foreign earnings are not reinvested indefinitely by our non us subsidiaries  and accordingly  recorded a deferred income tax expense on these undistributed earnings 
we periodically determine whether the non us subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassesses this determination as appropriate 
as of january   we determined that million of undistributed foreign earnings were not reinvested indefinitely by our non us subsidiaries 
during fiscal  deferred income taxes of million were recorded as a reduction to our net earnings on these unremitted earnings 
we periodically determine whether the non us subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination as appropriate

return to top item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we have operations outside of the united states and sell our products worldwide 
our activities expose us to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
these financial exposures are actively monitored and  where considered appropriate  managed by us 
we enter into contracts  with the intention of limiting these risks  with only those counterparties that we deem to be creditworthy  in order to also mitigate our non performance risk 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk on both variable rate debt and our investments in auction rate securities 
as of january   we are subject to interest rate risk on approximately million of variable rate debt 
a percentage point increase in the interest rate would not have a material impact on pre tax earnings 
as of january   we held million of auction rate securities  at par value 
a percentage point decrease in the rate of return would impact pre tax earnings by approximately million if applied to the total 
investment risk we are subject to investment risks on our marketable securities due to market volatility 
as of january  we held million in equity and debt instruments which have been adjusted to fair value based on current market data 
foreign currency risk we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on foreign denominated inventory purchases  intercompany payables and certain foreign denominated loans 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we hedge the net assets of certain of our foreign operations through foreign currency forward contracts 
the net after tax gain related to the derivative net investment hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci during fiscal was million 
the after tax gain in aoci related to net investment hedges as of january  was million 
we have designated our forward exchange contracts on forecasted intercompany purchases and future purchase commitments as cash flow hedges and as such  as long as the hedge remains effective and the underlying transaction remains probable  the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of these contracts will be recorded in aoci until earnings are affected by the variability of the cash flows being hedged 
with regard to commitments for inventory purchases  upon payment of each commitment  the underlying forward contract is closed and the corresponding gain or loss is transferred from aoci and is included in the measurement of the cost of the acquired asset 
if a hedging instrument is sold or terminated prior to maturity  gains and losses are deferred in aoci until the hedged item is settled 
however  if the hedged item is no longer likely to occur  the resulting gain or loss on the terminated hedge is recognized into earnings immediately 
during fiscal the amount transferred to earnings was insignificant 
gains included in aoci at january  are insignificant  and are expected to be transferred into earnings within the next twelve months upon payment of the underlying commitment 

return to top we have designated our foreign currency forward contracts related to certain foreign denominated loans and intercompany payables as fair value hedges 
the gains or losses on the fair value hedges are recognized into earnings and generally offset the transaction gains or losses in the foreign denominated loans that they are intended to hedge
