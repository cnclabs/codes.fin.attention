critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 

table of contents a summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in note to the financial statements 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements  including the following revenue recognition we record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided 
medicare and medicaid revenues represented  and of our net patient revenues during  and  respectively 
revenues from managed care entities  including health maintenance organizations and managed medicare and medicaid programs accounted for  and of our net patient revenues during  and  respectively 
we report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third party payors and others for services rendered 
we have agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates 
payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge  reimbursed costs  discounted charges and per diem payments 
estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements 
we closely monitor our historical collection rates  as well as changes in applicable laws  rules and regulations and contract terms  to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available 
however  due to the complexities involved in these estimations  actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record 
we estimate our medicare and medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information  patient utilization data  government provided data and in accordance with applicable medicare and medicaid payment rules and regulations 
the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term 
certain types of payments by the medicare program and state medicaid programs eg medicare disproportionate share hospital  medicare allowable bad debts and inpatient psychiatric services are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements 
such amounts are included in accounts receivable  net  on our consolidated balance sheets 
the funding of both federal medicare and state medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes 
as such  we can not provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations  if enacted  will not have a material impact on our future medicare and medicaid reimbursements 
adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in or and favorably impacted our after tax operating results by million million pre tax 
if it were to occur  each adjustment to our estimated net medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of december   would change our after tax net income by approximately million 
we provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates 
because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care  they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable  net 
our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts  based on charges at established rates  amounting to amounts include uninsured discounts mentioned above and data related to an acute care facility that is reflected as discontinued operations million  million and million during  and  respectively 
at our acute care facilities  medicaid pending accounts comprise the large majority of our receivables that are pending approval from third party payors but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payors such as county indigent programs in certain states 
approximately or million as of december  and or million as of december  of our accounts receivable  net  were comprised of medicaid pending accounts 
our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient s responsible party at the time of registration 
at that time  an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is 
table of contents assigned 
there are various pre established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered 
certain patients may be classified as medicaid pending at registration if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently medicaid eligible without further evaluation 
when a patient is registered as medicaid eligible or medicaid pending  our patient accounting system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established medicaid reimbursement rates pending ultimate disposition of the patient s medicaid eligibility 
based on historical hindsight information related to medicaid pending accounts  we estimate that approximately or million of the million medicaid pending accounts receivable as of december  will subsequently qualify for medicaid reimbursement 
approximately or million of million total medicaid pending accounts receivable as of december  subsequently qualified for medicaid pending reimbursement and were therefore appropriately classified at the patient s registration 
additional charity reserves of million during each of and were established to cover the medicaid pending patients that failed to qualify for the medicaid program based on historical conversion rates 
based on general factors as discussed below in provision for doubtful accounts  our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible 
such estimated uncollectible amounts related to medicaid pending  as well as other accounts receivable payor classifications  are considered when the overall individual facility and company wide reserves are developed 
below are the medicaid pending receivable agings as of december  and amounts in thousands under days days days over days total provision for doubtful accounts collection of receivables from third party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance 
our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility  primarily co payments and deductibles 
we estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix  the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience 
we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectibility of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted 
at our acute care hospitals  third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account 
for those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients  the patient is sent at least two statements followed by a series of collection letters 
if the patient is deemed unwilling to pay  the account is written off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort 
patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for write off as potential charity care 
our accounts receivable are recorded net of established charity care reserves of million as of december  and million as of december  including additional charity care reserves of million established during each of and  as discussed above in revenue recognition 
uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients are extended an uninsured discount of at least of total charges 
during the collection process the hospital establishes a partial reserve in the allowance for doubtful accounts for self pay balances outstanding for greater than days from the date of discharge 
all self pay accounts at the hospital level are fully reserved if they have been outstanding for greater than days from the date of discharge 
third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past days from the date of discharge 
potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay 

table of contents on a consolidated basis  we monitor our total self pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience 
at december  and december   accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
approximately during  during and during  of our consolidated provision for doubtful accounts  was incurred by our acute care hospitals 
shown below is our payor mix concentrations and related aging of our billed accounts receivable  net of contractual allowances  for our acute care hospitals as of december  and as of december  amounts in thousands days days days over days medicare medicaid commercial insurance and other private pay total as of december  amounts in thousands days days days over days medicare medicaid commercial insurance and other private pay total self insured risks we provide for self insured risks  primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims  based on estimates of the ultimate costs for both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported 
estimated losses from asserted and incurred but not reported claims are accrued based on our estimates of the ultimate costs of the claims  which includes costs associated with litigating or settling claims  and the relationship of past reported incidents to eventual claims payments 
all relevant information  including our own historical experience  the nature and extent of existing asserted claims and reported incidents  is used in estimating the expected amount of claims 
we also consider amounts that may be recovered from excess insurance carriers  state guaranty funds and other sources in estimating our ultimate net liability for such risk 
our estimated self insured reserves are reviewed and changed  if necessary  at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense 
for the years of through  most of our subsidiaries were covered under commercial insurance policies with phico  a pennsylvania based insurance company that was placed into liquidation in february  as a result  although phico continued to be liable for claims on our behalf that were related to through  we began paying the claims upon phico s liquidation 
since that time  although we preserved our right to receive reimbursement from the phico estate  we were not previously able to assess the probability of collection or reasonably quantify our share of the liquidation proceeds 
in january   a court order from the commonwealth court of pennsylvania was executed in connection with the partial liquidation of the phico estate 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  based upon our share of the undisputed and resolved claims made against the phico estate as of a specified date and as approved by the liquidator to the court  we recorded a million reduction to our professional and general liability self insured claims expense 
these liquidation proceeds were received during the first quarter of during the second quarter of  based upon the results of a reserve analysis  we recorded an million pre minority interest reduction to our prior year reserves for professional and general liability self insured 
table of contents claims 
this favorable change in our estimated future claims payments was partially due to the favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate as well as a decrease in obstetrical related claims due to a company wide patient safety initiative in this high risk specialty 
adjustments to our prior year reserves for professional and general liability self insured claims did not have a material impact on our financial statements during based upon the results of workers compensation reserves analyses  we recorded reductions to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims amounting to million during recorded during the fourth quarter and million during million recorded during the second quarter of and million recorded during the fourth quarter of 
adjustments to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims did not have a material impact on our financial statements during although we are unable to predict whether or not our future financial statements will include adjustments to our prior year reserves for self insured general and professional and workers compensation claims  given the relatively unpredictable nature of the these potential liabilities and the factors impacting these reserves  it is reasonably likely that our future financial results may include material adjustments to prior period reserves 
below is a schedule showing the changes in our general and professional liability and workers compensation reserves during the three years ended december  amount in thousands general and professional liability workers compensation total balance at january  a plus accrued insurance expense  net of commercial premiums paid less payments made in settlement of self insured claims plus liabilities assumed at acquisition balance at january  a plus accrued insurance expense  net of commercial premiums paid less payments made in settlement of self insured claims balance at january  a plus accrued insurance expense  net of commercial premiums paid b less payments made in settlement of self insured claims balance at december  a a net of expected recoveries from various state guaranty funds in connection with a commercial general and professional insurance company s phico liquidation in see professional and general liability claims and property insurance 
b excludes the impact of the million recovery from the liquidation of the phico estate  as discussed above 
in addition  we also maintain self insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims 
the ultimate costs related to these programs include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported 
long lived assets we review our long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates 

table of contents goodwill goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit 
we have designated september st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of september  which indicated no impairment of goodwill 
future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review  including profitability and market value projections  could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write off of a portion or all of our goodwill 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
we believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carryforwards 
we operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws 
we are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities 
during  the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions including accrued interest and penalties were increased in the amount of approximately million due to tax positions taken in the current and prior years 
also during  the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions including accrued interest and penalties were reduced due to the lapse of the statute of limitations resulting in a net income tax benefit of approximately million 
during  the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions including accrued interest and penalties were reduced due to the lapse of the statue of limitations and the conclusions of income tax audits of varying taxing authorities resulting in a net income tax benefit of approximately million 
our tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service irs through the year ended december  the irs has recently commenced an audit for the tax year ended december  we believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal  foreign and state taxes 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized a million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
this decrease in the liability resulted in an increase to the january  balance of retained earnings of approximately million 
as of january   after the implementation of fin  our unrecognized tax benefits were approximately million 
the amount at implementation that would favorably affect the effective tax rate and provision for income taxes was approximately million  approximately million of which was recorded during the balance at december  and  if subsequently recognized  that would favorably affect the effective tax rate and provision for income taxes is approximately million and million  respectively

hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels  the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients  the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services 
charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided eg  medical surgical  intensive care or behavioral health and the geographic location of the hospital 
inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons  many of which are beyond our control 
the percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years  primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis  as well as increased pressure from medicare  medicaid and private insurers to 
table of contents reduce hospital stays and provide services  where possible  on a less expensive outpatient basis 
we believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues 
patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under medicare  medicaid  some private insurance plans  and managed care plans  but are responsible for services not covered by such plans  exclusions  deductibles or co insurance features of their coverage 
the amount of such exclusions  deductibles and co insurance has generally been increasing each year 
indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue 
collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payers and we continue to experience an increase in uninsured and self pay patients which unfavorably impacts the collectibility of our patient accounts thereby increasing our provision for doubtful accounts and charity care provided 
the significant portion of our revenues derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory  economic  environmental and competition changes in texas and nevada 
any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory  economic  environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results 
the following tables show the approximate percentages of net patient revenue during the past three years excludes sources of revenues for all periods presented for divested facilities which are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for i our acute care and behavioral health care facilities combined  ii our acute care facilities  and  iii our behavioral health care facilities

table of contents medicare medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged and over  some disabled persons and persons with end stage renal disease 
all of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities 
amounts received under the medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided 
since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the medicare program  our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program 
under the medicare program  for inpatient services  our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system ipps 
under the ipps  hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge 
the fixed payment amount is based upon each patient s diagnosis related group drg 
every drg is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis 
the drg payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care 
this drg assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each drg 
the drg and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity 
while we generally will not receive payment from medicare for inpatient services  other than the drg payment  a hospital may qualify for an outlier payment if a particular patient s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold 
drg rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year  which begins on october the index used to adjust the drg rates  known as the hospital market basket index  gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services 
generally  however  the percentage increases in the drg payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals 
for federal fiscal years  and  the update factors were  and  respectively 
for  the update factor is 
hospitals are allowed to receive the full basket update if they provide the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms with specific data relating to the quality of services provided 
we have complied fully with this requirement and intend to comply fully in future periods 
in august  cms finalized new provisions for the hospital ipps for the upcoming federal fiscal year  which included a significant change in the manner in which it determines the underlying relative weights used to calculate the drg payment amount 
for federal fiscal year  cms began to phase in the use of hospital costs rather than hospital charges for the drg relative weight determination 
this change is to phase in ratably over three years with full phase in to be completed in federal fiscal year on august   cms issued a final rule revising medicare payment and policy under the hospital ipps for federal fiscal year these changes  which were first proposed in april  will restructure the inpatient drgs to account more fully for the severity of patient illness 
specifically  the final rule creates new severity adjusted drgs to replace the current drgs 
as a result  payments are expected to increase for hospitals serving more severely ill patients and decrease for those serving patients who are less severely ill 
the new severity adjusted drgs were phased in over two years starting october  and will be fully phased during the federal fiscal year ending september  the new severity adjusted drgs have resulted in an approximate percent increase in to our inpatient medicare drg reimbursement as compared to the prior drg system 
the august  final rule also includes important provisions to ensure that medicare no longer pays for the additional costs of certain preventable conditions including certain infections acquired in the hospital 
the reporting of hospital acquired conditions  also referred to as present on admission poa codes  became effective on october  further  cms implemented medicare drg payment reductions for certain 
table of contents preventable conditions beginning on october  we do not expect this payment change for preventable conditions to have a material impact on our results of operations 
in addition  the rule expanded the list of publicly reported quality measures that hospitals would need to report in calendar year in order to qualify for the full market basket update in federal fiscal year and reduces medicare s payment when a hospital replaces a device that is supplied to the hospital at no or reduced cost 
in september   the tma  abstinence education  and qi programs extension act of legislation took effect and will scale back cuts in hospital reimbursement that cms was set to impose under the final rule for the inpatient prospective payment system ipps for federal fiscal year cms planned on reducing the standardized amount by in and in to account for expected changes in coding practices by hospitals in response to the cms implementation of the new medicare severity diagnosis related group system for inpatient hospitals 
the new law cuts these reductions by in and in in federal fiscal years to  the new law also requires cms to make an adjustment to the medicare standardized amount in these years to reflect the removal of actual aggregate payment increases or decreases for documentation and coding adjustments that occurred during federal fiscal years and as compared to the initial cms estimates of the ms drg coding and documentation change impact of and  respectively 
we are unable to predict the impact of this cms adjustment on the revenues and operating results of our acute care hospitals 
in july   cms published the final ipps payment rule which provides for a market basket increase to the base medicare drg blended rate 
when statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors and annual geographic wage index updates are considered  we estimate our overall increase from the final rule in federal fiscal year will approximate to 
outpatient services were traditionally paid at the lower of customary charges or on a reasonable cost basis 
the balanced budget act of established the outpatient prospective payment system for outpatient hospital services provided on or after august  opps 
under the opps  cms pays for hospital outpatient services on a rate per service basis that varies according to the ambulatory payment classification apc group to which the service is assigned 
the opps rate is an unadjusted national payment amount that includes the medicare payment and the beneficiary co payment 
special payments under the opps may be made for certain new technology items and services through transitional pass through payments and special reimbursement rates 
on november   cms released a final rule with comment period updating the hospital opps 
the rule is effective for those services furnished in calendar year  by general acute care hospitals  inpatient rehabilitation facilities  inpatient psychiatric facilities and long term acute care hospitals 
cms estimates that hospitals will receive an overall average increase of percent in medicare payments for outpatient services in  after accounting for the annual market basket update and other factors that typically affect the level of payments 
changes in the final rule including providing larger payment bundles for certain opps services which will  in cms s estimation  provide hospitals with more flexibility in managing their resources 
the rule also updates the payment rates for the revised ambulatory surgical center payment system  beginning in we operate inpatient rehabilitation hospital units that treat medicare patients with specific medical conditions which are excluded from the medicare ipps drg payment methodology 
inpatient rehabilitation facilities irfs must meet a certain volume threshold each year for the number patients with these specific medical conditions  often referred to as the percent rule 
the medicare  medicaid and schip extension act of mmsea included a favorable permanent decrease of the irf percent rule qualifying threshold to from the current threshold of 
medicare payment for irf patients is based on a prospective case rate based on a cms determined case mix group classification and is updated annually by cms 
the mmsea includes provisions that provide irf s with a zero percent increase in medicare rates for federal fiscal year psychiatric hospitals have also traditionally been excluded from the ipps 
however  on january   cms implemented a new pps psych pps for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the 
table of contents medicare program 
this system replaced the cost based reimbursement guidelines with a per diem psych pps with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics 
the psych pps also contained provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital s base payment if it maintains a full service emergency department 
the new system was phased in over a three year period and was fully implemented for our behavioral health facilities by june  also  cms has included a stop loss provision to ensure that hospitals avoid significant losses during the transition 
in may  cms published its annual increase to the federal component of the psych pps per diem rate 
this increase includes the effects of market basket updates resulting in a increase in total payments for rate year  covering the period of july  to june  the market basket was increased by for the period of july  through june  in addition  according to the may  cms notice  the market basked increase is for the period of july  through june  medicaid medicaid is a joint federal state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care 
most state medicaid payments are made under a pps like system  or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals 
amounts received under the medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided 
in addition to revenues received pursuant to the medicare program  we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing medicaid 
all of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities 
we receive a large concentration of our medicaid revenues from texas and significant amounts from nevada  florida  california  washington  dc and illinois 
these states  as well as most other states in which we operate  have reported significant budget deficits that  for all except texas at this time  have resulted in the reduction of medicaid funding for we can provide no assurance that reductions to medicaid revenues  particularly in the above mentioned states  will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
furthermore  many states are currently working to effectuate further significant reductions in the level of medicaid funding due to significant state budget deficits also projected for  which could adversely affect future levels of medicaid reimbursement received by our hospitals 
conversely  on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of was signed into law and contained various medicaid provisions that will impact our hospitals including the following i temporary increases to medicaid funding through enhanced federal matching assistance percentages fmaps for a month period retroactive to october  through december  with all states receiving a fmap increase of and also receiving a bonus fmap increase contingent on the increased level of a state s unemployment rate  ii a temporary increase of in the federal medicaid disproportionate share hospital allotment for both federal fiscal years and  and  iii states will be required to maintain effort on medicaid eligibility consistent with requirements prior to passage of this law 
due to the indirect nature of the enhanced medicaid federal funding contained within the american recovery and reinvestment act of  we are unable to determine the impact of these medicaid changes on our future results of operations 
in february   a texas medicaid state plan amendment went into effect for potter county that expands the supplemental inpatient reimbursement methodology for the state s medicaid program 
this state plan amendment was approved retroactively to march  in connection with this program  we earned revenues of million during  million during and million during at this time  the local hospital district in potter county continues to fund the program s inter governmental transfers igts 
the failure of the hospital district to make future igts at a level consistent with levels will reduce revenues in connection with this program to approximately million during if during the hospital district makes igts consistent with  we believe we would be entitled to revenues of approximately million during in july   cms retroactively approved to june   an amendment to the texas medicaid state plan which permits the state of texas to make supplemental payments to certain hospitals located in hidalgo  maverick and webb counties 
our four acute care hospital facilities located in these counties are eligible to receive these 
table of contents supplemental medicaid payments 
this program was subject to final state rule making procedures and the local governmental agencies providing the necessary funds on an ongoing basis through inter governmental transfers to the state of texas 
in connection with this program  we earned revenues of million during  million during before million reduction recorded during to establish a reserve for the and supplemental payments  as discussed below and million during at this time  we believe we will be entitled to revenues of approximately million during in connection with this program 
as part of the cms routine retroactive review of a new texas medicaid state plan amendment spa that pertains to the medicaid supplemental payment programs for hidalgo and webb counties  cms previously indicated that certain igts related to this retroactive spa approval may have been ineligible for federal matching dollars which were used to fund the programs 
in the anticipation of a possible cms retroactive igt ineligibility determination  we recorded a charge of million during to establish a reserve for potential cms action related to these medicaid supplemental payments applicable to state fiscal years and in april   we received notification that the million of retroactive medicaid supplemental payment were deemed ineligible for federal matching dollars 
these funds will be recouped by the texas health and human services commission thhsc as an offset to future igts during state fiscal year in october   we were notified by the thhsc that cms deferred approximately of the federal financial participation ffp on medicaid supplemental payments made to private hospitals during the second calendar quarter of pursuant to two spas approved by cms in july and september of this deferral applies to our acute care hospitals that operate in hildalgo  maverick and webb counties 
in april   we received notification from thhsc that a settlement agreement has been reached with cms and that both cms and thhsc intend to remove the supplemental payment deferral status 
thhsc has resumed its distribution of supplemental payments in august  at levels consistent with pre deferral amounts 
we estimate that our hospitals in these counties will be entitled to supplemental payment reimbursements of approximately million annually 
in september  legislation in texas went into effect that ensures that some form of medicaid managed care will exist in every texas county 
in addition  the texas star plus program  which provides an integrated acute and long term care medicaid managed care delivery system to elderly and disabled medicaid beneficiaries in the harris county service area will be expanded to seven additional service areas 
such actions could have a material unfavorable impact on the reimbursement our texas hospitals receive 
we operate two freestanding psychiatric hospitals in the dallas  texas region that operated under the lone star select ii prospective per diem payment program 
we were notified by the commission that this per diem payment program terminated on august  these affected facilities were paid on a tefra cost based payment system for september and october of effective november   the commission s payment for these hospitals is based on a prospective per diem rate based on a prior year cost report 
as directed by texas senate bill  the hhsc is currently drafting a medicaid reform waiver waiver proposal that would create a newly established healthcare opportunity pool that requires cms s approval prior to implementation 
the overall waiver program design will be budget neutral on a statewide basis but individual hospitals  including those owned and operated by us  could be either favorably or adversely impacted 
although  at this time  we are unable to estimate the impact of the waiver program on our future operating results  we can give no assurance that this waiver program will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
hhsc has yet to receive cms s approval for this waiver and it s uncertain as to when  or if  this waiver program will be implemented by hhsc 
managed care a significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies  which include health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and managed medicare referred to as medicare part c or medicare advantage and medicaid programs 
in general  we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow 
the consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary 
table of contents among the markets in which we operate 
typically  we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers  however  during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies 
tricare in april   the department of defense dod issued a proposed rule that would change the payment methodology for outpatient services that  if enacted  could significantly decrease payment for these services 
in december   the dod issued a final rule that basically adopted the current medicare payment outpatient prospective payment system for services provided to tricare outpatients with a limited phase in for certain emergency and clinic services 
based upon our estimates  payments to us for these services could be reduced by as much as million in and by million annually in and thereafter 
the effective date of this final rule is projected to be may  commercial insurance our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance 
private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or  in some cases  reimburse their policy holders  based upon the particular hospital s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy 
private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor 
commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms  including predetermined payment or drg based payment systems  for more inpatient and outpatient services 
to the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries  such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals 
as mentioned above  the american recovery and reinvestment act of was signed into law in february  this law contains a federal health care provision that provides a subsidy for cobra continuation premiums for up to nine months for workers who have been involuntarily terminated  including their families 
we are unable to determine the impact of this provision on our future results of operations 
other sources our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage 
such patients are evaluated  at the time of service or shortly thereafter  for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines  qualifications for medicaid or other state assistance programs  as well as our local hospital s indigent and charity care policy 
patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for medicaid or indigent care write offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances 
in addition  effective january   we implemented a formal uninsured discount policy for our acute care hospitals which had the effect of lowering both our provision for doubtful accounts and net revenues during and but did not materially impact net income in either year 
state medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments hospitals that have an unusually large number of low income patients ie  those with a medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean medicaid utilization  or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding are eligible to receive a disproportionate share hospital dsh adjustment 
congress established a national limit on dsh adjustments 
although this legislation and the resulting state broad based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the medicaid program  to date the net impact has not been materially adverse 
upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of texas and south carolina s low income patients  five of our facilities located in texas and one facility located in south carolina received additional reimbursement from each state s dsh fund 
the texas and south carolina programs have been renewed for each state s fiscal years covering the period of september  through august  for texas and october  through september  for south carolina 
included in our financial results was an aggregate of million during  million during and million during failure to renew these dsh programs beyond their scheduled termination dates  failure of our hospitals that currently receive dsh payments to qualify for future dsh funds under these programs  or reductions in reimbursements  could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 

table of contents in february  the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services published a report indicating that texas medicaid may have overpaid texas hospitals for dsh payments 
to date  no actions to follow up on this report have had any material impact on our texas hospitals 
sources of revenues and health care reform given increasing budget deficits  the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of medicare and medicaid funding  which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals 
in addition  the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of  among other things  the ongoing military engagement in iraq  the war on terrorism  economic recovery stimulus packages  responses to natural disasters  such as hurricane katrina  the continuing expansion of a medicare drug benefit and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future 
we are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations 
in addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the medicare and each of the state medicaid programs  our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings  new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations  post payment audits  requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions  all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities 
the final determination of amounts we receive under the medicare and medicaid programs often takes many years  because of audits by the program representatives  providers rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions 
we believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments 
nevertheless  until final adjustments are made  certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required 
finally  we expect continued third party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls 
reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations

however  we are liable for of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of million up to million per occurrence and in the aggregate

while we continuously monitor these factors  our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate 
given our significant self insured exposure for professional and general liability claims  there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations

as a result  during the fourth quarter of  based upon our share of the undisputed and resolved claims made against the phico estate as of a specified date and as approved by the liquidator to the court  we recorded a million reduction to our professional and general liability self insured claims expense 
since we received these liquidation proceeds during the first quarter of  the million reimbursement from the phico estate is included in accounts receivable  net  as of december  we are also entitled to receive reimbursement from state guaranty funds for certain claims paid by us 
included in other assets was million as of december  and million as of december  related to estimated expected recoveries from various state guaranty funds in connection with payment of these claims 
effective april   we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from windstorm damage up to a billion policy limit per occurrence 
losses resulting from non named windstorms are subject to a  deductible 
losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to a deductible based upon the declared value of the property 
in addition  we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and flood damage  each subject to aggregated loss limits as opposed to per occurrence losses our earthquake limit is million  except for facilities in alaska  california and the new madrid which includes certain counties located in arkansas  illinois  kentucky  mississippi  missouri and tennessee and pacific northwest seismic zones which are subject to a million limitation 
the earthquake limit in puerto rico is million 
earthquake losses are 
table of contents subject to a  deductible for our facilities located in all states except california  alaska  washington and puerto rico where earthquake losses are subject to a deductible based upon the declared value of the property 
flood losses have a  deductible except in fema designated flood zones a and v which are located in certain sections of florida  oklahoma and texas in which case the losses are subject to a  deductible 
due to an increase in property losses experienced nationwide in recent years  the cost of commercial property insurance has increased 
as a result  catastrophic coverage for earthquake and flood has been limited to annual aggregate losses as opposed to per occurrence losses 
given these insurance market conditions  there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends  or a sharp increase in uninsured property losses sustained by us  will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
effects of inflation and seasonality seasonality our business is typically seasonal  with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
this seasonality occurs because  generally  more people become ill during the winter months  which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months 
inflation although inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years  the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are rising supply costs which tend to escalate as vendors pass on the rising costs through price increases 
our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide  which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries  wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate 
although we cannot predict our ability to continue to cover future cost increases  we believe that through adherence to cost containment policies  labor management and reasonable price increases  the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable 
however  our ability to pass on these increased costs associated with providing healthcare to medicare and medicaid patients is limited due to various federal  state and local laws which have been enacted that  in certain cases  limit our ability to increase prices 
in addition  as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures and a continuing industry wide shift of patients into managed care plans  our ability to maintain margins through price increases to non medicare patients is limited
