item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis presents management s perspective of our business  financial condition and overall performance 
this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance  current financial condition and outlook for the future 
our discussion and analysis relates to the following topics overview of business overview of results and outlook liquidity and capital resources changes in financial condition and results of operations share capital critical accounting policies contractual cash obligations overview of business we are a us public company based in calgary  alberta engaging in a variety of projects in the oil and gas sector and in particular the oil sands and oil shale sectors in western canada 
we are aggressively exploring canada s largest contiguous oil sands land holding  which is located in northeast alberta  northwest saskatchewan and oilsands quest is leading the development of an oil sands industry in the province of saskatchewan 
oilsands quest  together with its subsidiaries  is in the exploration and development stage and does not currently have any income from operating activities 
for a more detailed discussion of our business see part  item  description of business 
overview of results and outlook during the year ended april   the company s activities included an exploration drilling program of delineation test wells on its permit lands in saskatchewan and alberta  advancement of its pre commercialization evaluation studies on and reservoir test program on its axe lake discovery  a comprehensive d and d seismic program in saskatchewan and on adjacent alberta permits  and an extensive environmental program consisting of monitoring and baseline assessment studies 
during the year ended april   we raised million  net of issuance costs  through private placement share issuances  a marketed public offering and proceeds of warrant and option exercises to fund these activities and future programs 
operations summary exploration program in the fall of  we drilled exploration and delineation test wells in the axe lake area  and three exploration test wells in saskatchewan 
in early  we drilled exploration and delineation test wells in raven ridge 
evaluation of the drilling data is currently underway 
a mile kilometer d seismic program was conducted on saskatchewan permits which have not been explored by us through drilling or seismic exploration 
we are also continuing with the interpretation of the  kilometers  miles of d and d seismic data collected and processed in the winter program  which is aiding in the characterization of the reservoir and adjacent formation specific to our three test sites at axe lake and the reservoirs at raven ridge and in assessing the geological structures on our lands

table of contents axe lake discovery reservoir development activities at test site  we drilled and completed six vertical test holes and drilled three metre horizontal holes metres length within the reservoir 
we have procured the horizontal well instrumentation strings necessary to measure the temperature and pressure in the reservoir 
we have completed construction of water treatment  steam generation and extraction collection facilities  which includes three steam generators  two diesel power generators  water oil treatment and oil handling equipment  control systems and eight heated liquid storage tanks to support related test site activities 
we are nearing completion on the vertical well modules and the supporting electrical and data acquisition systems 
during the year we continued to work on comprehensive simulation studies to develop guidelines on how to best operate the recovery process for the six vertical multi purpose test holes for the axe lake test site reservoir test program 
the numerical reservoir simulation studies and the supporting laboratory experiments focused on demonstrating fluid mobility and communication between the vertical wells along the bottom of the oil sands reservoir 
a comprehensive reservoir monitoring program to support the reservoir test program for the six vertical test holes and three horizontal wells has been developed which includes pressure and temperature monitoring  actual performance versus modeled performance and possible geophysical logging 
also at test site  we completed two mini frac tests that successfully measured the relevant geo mechanical properties of the oil sands reservoir  as well as the the overburden and underburden close to the oil sands reservoir 
calibration of the numerical reservoir simulation tools to the mini frac tests by conventional history matching techniques is near completion and will support the detailed planning of the initial cold water injection test 
at test site  the front end engineering and design work on a facility for solvent testings using hot propane vapor  initiated earlier in the year  is now complete 
construction has been deferred until funding is in place for these tests 
at test site  we are conducting initial low energy tests using a custom  downhole electrical heater 
we measure pressures and temperatures at ten different locations inside the oil sands reservoir 
this information has been used for preliminary calibration of our reservoir simulator 
information from the simulator will help maximize the efficiency of the steaming tests on the vertical well program at test site we have drilled  completed and instrumented two vertical test holes together with the supporting infrastructure 
ongoing heating of the reservoir was initiated in late october and re commenced in mid january of with the heater placed at the depth of the devonian underburden 
in april of  the heater was raised at the bottom of the oil sands reservoir and heating was continued 
the data gathered from these low energy tests will provide the company with preliminary in situ reservoir performance data to be used for simulation modeling in preparation for hot water and steam injection at test site and in the continued planning for test sites and the program at test site has enabled the determination of critical reservoir properties such as effective thermal conductivity and the initial low energy test is nearing completion subject to regulatory and management approvals with the determination of relative permeability of the reservoir at different temperatures 
abandonment and reclamation costs we are responsible for compliance with terms and conditions of environmental and regulatory approvals and all laws and regulations regarding the abandonment of a project and reclamation of its lands at the end of its economic life  which abandonment and reclamation costs may be substantial 
a breach of such legislation and or regulations may result in the issuance of remedial orders  the suspension of approvals  or the imposition of fines and penalties  including an order for cessation of operations at the site until satisfactory remedies are made 
as at april   we estimate the total undiscounted inflation adjusted amount required to settle the asset retirement obligations in respect of the company s wells and facilities is approximately million 
this estimate includes the costs to reclaim the air strip  camp site  access roads and reservoir test sites which are being brought into income over a period of to years 
the initial measurement of an asset retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its fair value  with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to property and equipment or exploration expense 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have sufficient funds to carry out our planned activities over the next twelve months 
if we accelerate commercial development at axe lake or any of our other prospects  our cash requirements will increase significantly 
additional funding may also be required if our current planned activities are changed in scope or if actual costs differ from estimates of current plans 
we believe the company will have access to sufficient funding and sources of capital for its planned activities to april  because we constantly and actively monitor our expenditure budgets  if sufficient funding is not available we can adjust our expenditure plans based on available cash 
we plan to fund future operations by way of financing  including a public offering or private placement of equity or debt securities 
our development strategy also includes considering partners on a joint venture basis on our specific projects to fund the development of such projects in a timely and responsible manner 
however  there is no assurance that debt or equity financing or joint venture partner arrangements will be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  to meet these requirements 
the company has no revenues  and its operating results  profitability and the future rate of growth depend solely on management s ability to successfully implement the business plans and on the ability to raise further funding 
the following discussion of liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in part ii
