net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the net interest margin for was  up from these increases were the result of a slightly liability sensitive balance sheet combined with active management of deposit pricing 
in comparison to  the yield on interest bearing liabilities declined by  while the yield on interest earning assets only declined by 
the improvement in the net interest margin also reflects growth  and the improved mix of our balance sheet

provision for loan losses 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level based on management s assessment of the estimable and probable losses in the loan portfolio  pursuant to accounting literature  which is discussed further in the nonperforming assets section of this management s discussion and analysis 
management s evaluation is based upon a review of the portfolio and requires significant judgment 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for loan losses of million compared to million in and million in the million included million recorded in the fourth quarter of the larger provision amount was due to the rapid deterioration in the economic environment during the fourth quarter 
the million includes the following million was related to four large construction loans and land development projects  million was attributed to reserves for new loans  updated loss rate expectations on the consumer and mortgage portfolios  as well as credit risk migration in the commercial loan portfolio due to economic conditions  and million was a result of consumer credit losses taken during the fourth quarter of the increase in the provision for loan loss reflects our proactive approach in confronting the reality of the deepening economic recession 
noninterest income 
noninterest income decreased million to million in  or  from million in the majority of the decrease was due to a million decrease in credit card debit card and atm income due to reduced prime based atm bailment fees 
although noninterest income was negatively impacted by lower bailment fees  the net interest margin benefited due to lower funding costs for these borrowings 
in addition  had included a million non recurring gain related to the sale of our former headquarters building and an  gain from the sale of our credit card portfolio 
also during the year  income from bank owned life insuarance boli decreased  from the prior year due to lower yields in underlying investments funding this program 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in loan fee income of million 
the majority of the increase in loan fee income was due to  in fees from st reverse financial services  llc st reverse 
during the second quarter of we acquired a majority interest in st reverse  specializing in both reverse mortgage lending directly to consumers and business to business reverse mortgage lending through banks  brokers and financial institutions throughout the united states 
deposit service charges also increased million 
this increase was a result of overall growth in deposits 
in we also recorded a million gain on the sale of shares related to the completion of visa s initial public offering  and a million charge related to a mark to market adjustment on the million bbb rated mortgage backed security mbs issued in connection with a reverse mortgage securitization 
noninterest income increased million to million in  or  from million in this was attributable to a million increase in deposit service charges as we continued to benefit from increased deposit accounts and offered additional fee based services 
the increase also included a million non recurring gain related to the sale of our former headquarters building and an  gain from the sale of our credit card portfolio 
credit debit card and atm income also increased  as a result of increased volumes of cash in non owned atms and higher bailment fess earned on this cash 
in we also recorded two offsetting million items 
both occurred during the fourth quarter and resulted in a gain and an expense recognized from the donation of a nc wyeth mural  apotheosis of the family  which was located in our former headquarters 
noninterest expenses 
noninterest expenses increased million to million in  or  from million in excluding million of expenses related to st reverse  acquired in the second quarter of  expenses increased million or over as a result of continued growth efforts salaries  benefits  and other compensation increased million while other operating expenses increased million 
included in other operating expenses was a  increase in fdic charges due to increased assessment rates 
during the investment in wsfs franchise included the opening of one branch in selbyville  delaware  the relocation of another branch in smyrna  delaware  and the previously mentioned acquisition of branches 
further  during professional fees increased million as a result of legal fees reflecting increased costs relating to problem credits  reflecting credit costs associated with the challenging credit environment 
noninterest expenses increased million to million in  or  from million in wsfs showed strong growth in which included the opening of three branch offices  one branch renovation  and the relocation of our corporate headquarters 
as a result of this growth  the number of full time associates grew to  resulting in increased salaries  benefits and other compensation of million 
this growth also affected both occupancy expense  which increased by million  and other operating expenses  which increased by million 
during our marketing expenses increased million  as a multi year brand campaign was launched with the intent to leverage our stellar service model with the message we stand for service 
also during  we recorded a million expense related to the visa antitrust lawsuit settlement with american express and discover 
income taxes 
we recorded a million tax provision for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
the reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of volatility in effective tax rates 
the reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a million tax benefit related to the previously discussed donation of the nc wyeth mural 
the provision for income taxes includes federal  state and local income taxes that are currently payable or deferred because of temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax reporting bases of the assets and liabilities 
we analyze our projection of taxable income and make adjustments to our provision for income taxes accordingly 
for additional information regarding our tax provision and net operating loss carryforwards  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition total assets increased million  or  during to billion 
this increase was predominantly due to growth in net loans  which grew million  or  during total liabilities increased million during the year to billion at december  this increase was primarily the result of an increase in customer deposits of million  or and brokered deposits of million  or during partially offsetting these increases was an million  or decrease in fhlb advances 
cash in non owned atms 
during  cash in non owned atms managed by cashconnect  our atm unit  increased million  or

our mortgage backed securities are predominantly plain vanilla  aaa rated and of short duration 
investments in mortgage backed securities increased million during to million 
there were no sales of mortgage backed securities during the weighted average duration of the mortgage backed securities was years at december  investment securities 
our investment securities are comprised mostly of federal agency debt securities with a maturity of four years or less 
we own no collateralized debt obligations  bank trust preferred  agency preferred securities or equity securities in other fdic insured banks or thrifts 
loans  net 
net loans increased million  or  during this included increases of million  or  in commercial loans  million  or  in commercial real estate loans  and million  or  in consumer loans

for additional information regarding this transaction  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
customer time deposits cds increased million  or  in in addition  core deposit relationships demand deposits  money market and savings accounts increased million  or  during the year 
the table below depicts the changes in customer deposits over the last three years year ended december  in millions beginning balance interest credited deposit inflows  net ending balance borrowings and brokered certificates of deposit 
borrowings and brokered certificates of deposit decreased by million  or less than  during this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in fhlb advances of million  or 
partially offsetting this decrease was a million  or  increase in brokered deposits 
in addition  other borrowed funds increased million  or stockholders equity 
stockholders equity increased million to million at december  this increase included an increase of million in comprehensive income and million from the result of the exercise of common stock options 
partially offsetting these decreases was the purchase of  shares of treasury stock for million 
at december   we held million shares of our common stock as treasury stock 
long term  it is our intention to return some of our earnings to shareholders through share repurchases  which is subject to approval by the us treasury  while maintaining adequate levels of capital 
in addition  we declared cash dividends totaling million during asset liability management our primary asset liability management goal is to maximize net interest income opportunities within the constraints of managing interest rate risk  while ensuring adequate liquidity and funding and maintaining a strong capital base 
in general  interest rate risk is mitigated by closely matching the maturities or repricing periods of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to ensure a favorable interest rate spread 
we regularly review our interest rate sensitivity  and use a variety of strategies as needed to adjust that sensitivity within acceptable tolerance ranges established by management and the board of directors 
changing the relative proportions of fixed rate and adjustable rate assets and liabilities is one of our primary strategies to accomplish this objective 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest sensitivity gap 
an interest sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing within a defined period  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets repricing within a defined period 
the repricing and maturities of our interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities at december  are set forth in the following table less than one year one to five years over five years total dollars in thousands interest rate sensitive assets real estate loans commercial loans consumer loans mortgage backed securities loans held for sale investment securities interest bearing deposits in other banks interest rate sensitive liabilities money market and interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits retail time deposits jumbo certificates of deposit brokered certificates of deposit fhlb advances trust preferred borrowings other borrowed funds deficiency excess of interest rate sensitive assets over interest rate liabilities interest rate sensitive gap one year interest rate sensitive assets interest rate sensitive liabilities one year interest rate sensitive gap as a percent of total assets includes commercial mortgage  construction  and residential mortgage loans 
loan balances exclude deferred fees and costs 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling rates  a positive gap would result in a decrease in net interest income while a negative gap would augment net interest income 
however  the interest sensitivity table does not provide a comprehensive representation of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
each category of assets or liabilities will not be affected equally or simultaneously by changes in the general level of interest rates 
even assets and liabilities which contractually reprice within the rate period may not  in fact  reprice at the same price or the same time or with the same frequency 
it is also important to consider that the table represents a specific point in time 
variations can occur as we adjust our interest sensitivity position throughout the year 
to provide a more accurate position of our one year gap  certain deposit classifications are based on the interest rate sensitive attributes and not on the contractual repricing characteristics of these deposits 
management estimates  based on historical trends of our deposit accounts  that of money market and of interest bearing demand deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes and that to of savings deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes 
accordingly  these interest sensitive portions are classified in the less than one year category with the remainder in the over five year category 
deposit rates other than time deposit rates are variable  and changes in deposit rates are generally subject to local market conditions and management s discretion and are not indexed to any particular rate 
reverse mortgages we hold an investment in reverse mortgages of  at december  representing a participation in reverse mortgages with a third party 
the loans supporting this balance were originated in the early s 
reverse mortgage loans are contracts that require the lender to make monthly advances throughout the borrower s life or until the borrower relocates  prepays or the home is sold  at which time the loan becomes due and payable 
reverse mortgages are nonrecourse obligations  which means that the loan repayments are generally limited to the net sale proceeds of the borrower s residence 
we account for our investment in reverse mortgages by estimating the value of the future cash flows on the reverse mortgages at a rate deemed appropriate for these mortgages  based on the market rate for similar collateral 
actual cash flows from the maturity of these mortgage loans can result in significant volatility in the recorded value of reverse mortgage assets 
as a result  income varies significantly from reporting period to reporting period 
for the year ended december   we lost million in interest income on reverse mortgages as compared to posting income of million in and  in the loss in primarily resulted from the decrease in the values of the properties securing these mortgages  based on annual re evaluations and consistent with the decrease in home values over the past year 
the projected cash flows depend on assumptions about life expectancy of the mortgagee and the future changes in collateral values 
projecting the changes in collateral values is the most significant factor impacting the volatility of reverse mortgage values 
our current assumptions include a short term annual appreciation rate of in the first year  and a long term annual appreciation rate of in future years 
if the long term appreciation rate was increased to  the resulting impact on income would have been  conversely  if the long term appreciation rate was decreased to  the resulting impact on income would have been 
we also hold million in bbb rated mortgage backed securities classified as trading and have options to acquire up to of class o certificates issued in connection with securities consisting of a portfolio of reverse mortgages we previously owned 
the class o certificates are currently recorded on our financial statements at a zero value 
at the time of the securitization  the third party securitizer lehman brothers retained of the class o certificates from the securitization 
these class o certificates have no priority over other classes of certificates under the trust and no distributions will be made on the class o certificates until  among other conditions  the principal amount of each other class of notes has been reduced to zero 
the underlying assets  the reverse mortgages  are very long term assets 
therefore  any cash flow that might inure to the holder of the class o certificates is not expected to occur until many years in the future 
additionally  we can exercise our option on of the class o certificates in up to five separate increments for an aggregate purchase price of million any time between january  and the termination of the securitization trust 
the option to purchase the class o certificates does not meet the definition of a derivative under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities and is carried in our financial statements at cost 
during the third quarter of lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy 
we are currently in discussions with legal counsel to determine our legal rights with respect to the class o certificates 
during  we formed a new reverse mortgage initiative 
while our activity during the past two years has been limited to acting as a correspondent for these loans  it is our intention to originate and underwrite our own reverse mortgages in the future 
we expect to sell most of these loans and do not intend to hold them in our portfolio 
these reverse mortgages are government approved and insured 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets  which include nonaccruing loans  nonperforming real estate investments and assets acquired through foreclosure  can negatively affect our results of operations 
nonaccruing loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if  in the opinion of management  collection is doubtful  or when principal or interest is past due days or more and the value of the collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest 
interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed and charged against interest income 
in addition  the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest 
past due loans are defined as loans contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest payments but which remain in accrual status because they are considered well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table sets forth our nonperforming assets and past due loans at the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands nonaccruing loans commercial consumer commercial mortgages residential mortgages construction total nonaccruing loans assets acquired through foreclosure restructured loans total nonperforming assets past due loans residential mortgages commercial and commercial mortgages consumer total past due loans ratio of nonaccruing loans to total loans ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of loan loss allowance to nonaccruing loans total loans exclude loans held for sale 
the applicable allowance represents general valuation allowances only 
total nonperforming assets increased million during as a result  nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets increased from at december  to at december  non performing loans declined from december  level as exposures migrated to assets acquired through foreclosure and million in losses were recognized on construction loans 
restructured loans of million contributed to the increase in non performing assets 
all of the restructured loans are residential mortgage loans to home owners and represent loans in which we have made concessions in order to assist the borrower in making their payments 
the following table provides an analysis of the change in the balance of nonperforming assets during the last three years year ended december  in thousands beginning balance additions collections transfers to accrual charge offs write downs ending balance as of december   we had million of loans  which  although performing at that date  are believed to require increased supervision and review  and may  depending on the economic environment and other factors  become non performing assets in future periods 
the amount of such loans at december  was million 
the majority of the loans are secured by commercial real estate  with lesser amounts being secured by residential real estate  inventory and receivables 
allowance for loan losses 
we maintain allowances for credit losses and charge losses to these allowances when such losses are realized 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgement reflecting management s best estimate of probable loan losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable loan losses in the remaining loan portfolio 
our evaluation is based upon a continuing review of these portfolios 
we established our loan loss allowance in accordance with guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab 
its methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements which include specific allowances for identified problem loans  formula allowances for commercial and commercial real estate loans  and allowances for pooled homogenous loans 
specific reserves are established for certain loans in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a specific credit that management believes indicate the probability that a loss has been incurred 
the formula allowances for commercial and commercial real estate loans are calculated by applying estimated loss factors to outstanding loans based on the internal risk grade of loans 
for low risk commercial and commercial real estate loans the portfolio is pooled  based on internal risk grade  and estimates are based on a ten year net charge off history 
higher risk and criticized loans have loss factors that are derived from an analysis of both the probability of default and the probability of loss should default occur 
loss adjustment factors are applied based on criteria discussed below 
as a result  changes in risk grades of both performing and nonperforming loans affect the amount of the formula allowance 
pooled loans are loans that are usually smaller  not individually graded and homogenous in nature  such as consumer installment loans and residential mortgages 
loan loss allowances for pooled loans are based on a ten year net charge off history 
the average loss allowance per homogenous pool is based on the product of average annual historical loss rate and the estimated duration of the pool multiplied by the pool balances 
these separate risk pools are assigned a reserve for losses based upon this historical loss information and loss adjustment factors 
historical loss adjustment factors are based upon our evaluation of various current conditions including those listed below general economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas  credit quality trends  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  collateral values and loan to value ratios  loan volumes and concentrations  including changes in mix  seasoning of the loan portfolio  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments  bank regulatory examination results  and other factors  including changes in quality of the loan origination  servicing and risk management processes 
our loan officers and risk managers meet at least quarterly to discuss and review these conditions and risks associated with individual problem loans 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for such losses 
we also give consideration to the results of these regulatory agency examinations 
during  the provision for loan losses were affected by increased credit related costs due to the rapid deterioration in the economic environment during the fourth quarter including increased charge offs  a general migration to loans to lower credit grades  higher reserves for new loans  higher loss rate expectations  and higher estimated reserves for economic conditions 
the table below represents a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses during the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands beginning balance provision for loan losses charge offs residential real estate commercial real estate commercial overdrafts consumer total charge offs recoveries residential real estate commercial real estate commercial overdrafts consumer total recoveries net charge offs ending balance net charge offs to average gross loans outstanding  net of unearned income includes commercial mortgage and construction loans 
prior to april  overdraft charge offs recoveries were recognized in other operating expense 
the allowance for loan losses is allocated by major portfolio type 
as these portfolios have developed  they have become a source of historical data in projecting delinquencies and loss exposure  however  such allocations are not a guarantee of where future losses may occur 
while we have allocated the allowance for loan losses by portfolio type in the following table  the entire reserve is available for any loan portfolio to utilize

historically  we have had success in growing our loan portfolio 
for example  during the year ended december   net loan growth resulted in the use of million in cash 
the loan growth was primarily the result of our continued success increasing corporate and small business lending 
management expects this trend to continue 
while our loan to deposit ratio has been well above for many years  management has significant experience managing its funding needs through borrowings and deposit growth 
as a financial institution  we have ready access to several sources of funding 
among these are deposit growth brokered deposits borrowing from the fhlb fed discount window access other borrowings such as repurchase agreements cash flow from securities and loan sales and repayments net income 
our current branch expansion and renovation program is focused on expanding our retail footprint in delaware and attracting new customers to provide additional deposit growth 
customer deposit growth was strong  equaling million  or between december  and december  our portfolio of high quality  liquid investments  primarily short duration aaa rated  mortgage backed securities and agency notes also provide a source of cash flow to meet current cash needs 
if needed  portions of this portfolio  as well as portions of the loan portfolio  could be sold to provide cash to fund new loans 
during the year ended december   million in cash was provided by operating activities 
we have a policy that separately addresses liquidity  and management monitors our adherence to policy limits 
as part of the liquidity management process  we also monitor our available wholesale funding capacity 
at december   we had million in funding capacity at the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh and million in estimated funding capacity in brokered deposits 
also  liquidity risk management is a primary area of examination by the ots 
we have not used and have no intention of using any significant off balance sheet financing arrangement for liquidity management purposes 
our financial instruments with off balance sheet risk are limited to obligations to fund loans to customers pursuant to existing commitments and obligations of letters of credit 
in addition  we have not had and have no intention to have any significant transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated  limited purpose entities that could materially affect our liquidity or capital resources 
capital resources federal laws  among other things  require the ots to mandate uniformly applicable capital standards for all savings institutions 
these standards currently require institutions such as us to maintain a tangible capital ratio equal to of adjusted total assets  core or leverage capital equal to of adjusted total assets  tier capital equal to of risk weighted assets and total risk based capital a combination of core and supplementary capital equal to of risk weighted assets 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia  as well as other requirements  established five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  under capitalized  significantly under capitalized and critically under capitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier depends upon its capital levels in relation to various relevant capital measures  which include leverage and risk based capital measures and certain other factors 
depository institutions that are not classified as well capitalized are subject to various restrictions regarding capital distributions  payment of management fees  acceptance of brokered deposits and other operating activities 
at december   we are classified as well capitalized  the highest regulatory defined level  and in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements 
additional information concerning our regulatory capital compliance is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
since  the board of directors has approved several stock repurchase programs to acquire common stock outstanding 
as part of these programs  we acquired approximately  shares in and  shares in at december   we held million shares of our common stock as treasury shares 
at december   we had  shares remaining under our current share repurchase authorization 
on january   under the us treasury s capital purchase plan cpp  we sold  shares of senior preferred stock to the us treasury  having a liquidition amount equal to  per share  or million 
although we are currently well capitalized under regulatory guidelines  the board of directors believed it was advisable to take advantage of the cpp to raise additional capital to ensure that during these uncertain times  we are well positioned to support our existing operations as well as anticipated future growth 
additional information concerning the cpp is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as part of the cpp program  any share repurchases or increase in the dividend level from the september quarterly payment of per share  must be approved by the us treasury department 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that currently have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
additional information concerning our off balance sheet arrangements is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations at december   we had contractual obligations relating to operating leases  long term debt  data processing and credit obligations 
these obligations are summarized below 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations long term debt obligations data processing contracts credit obligations total impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased costs of our operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or the same extent as the price of goods and services 
recent legislation the economy is experiencing significantly reduced business activity as a result of  among other factors  disruptions in the financial system during the past year 
declines in the housing market during the past year  due to falling home prices and increased foreclosures and unemployment  have resulted in substantial declines in mortgage related asset values  which has had a dramatic negative impact on government sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks 
reflecting concern about the stability of the finance markets in general and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased  to provide funding and liquidity to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
in response to the financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions  on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was signed into law 
pursuant to the eesa  specifically the troubled asset relief program tarp thereunder  the us treasury will have the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
on october   the secretary of the department of the treasury announced the department of the treasury will purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of banks and thrifts through tarp s cpp 
under this program  from the billion authorized by the eesa  the treasury made billion of capital available to us financial institutions in the form of preferred stock 
in conjunction with the purchase of preferred stock  the treasury received  from participating financial institutions  warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to of the preferred stock investment 
participating financial institutions were required to adopt the treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury holds equity in such institution issued under the cpp 
on november   the board of directors of the fdic adopted a final rule relating to the temporary liquidity guarantee program the tlgp 
the tlgp was announced by the fdic on october   after the determination of systemic risk by the secretary of the department of treasury after consultation with the president  as an initiative to counter the system wide crisis in the nation s financial sector 
under the tlgp the fdic will i guarantee  through the earlier of maturity or june   certain newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by participating institutions on or after october   and before june  and ii provide full fdic insurance deposit insurance coverage for noninterest bearing transaction deposit accounts  negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts paying less than interest per annum and interest on lawyers trust accounts iolta accounts held at participating fdic insured institutions through december  coverage under the tlgp was available for the first days without charge 
the fee assessment for coverage of senior unsecured debt ranges from basis points to basis points per annum  depending on the initial maturity of the debt 
the fee assessment for deposit insurance coverage is basis points per quarter on amounts in covered accounts exceeding  on february   the us treasury and the federal bank regulatory agencies announced in a joint statement a new financial stability plan which would include additional capital support for banks under a capital assistance program  a public private investment fund to address existing bank loan portfolios and expanded funding for the frb s pending term asset backed securities loan facility to restart lending and the securitization markets 
on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was signed into law by president obama 
the arra includes a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health  and education needs 
in addition  the arra imposes certain new executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all current and future tarp recipients until the institution has repaid the us treasury  which is now permitted under the arra without penalty and without the need to raise new capital  subject to the us treasury s consultation with the recipient s appropriate regulatory agency 
the executive compensation standards under arra are more stringent than those currently in effect under the cpp or those previously proposed by the us treasury 
the new standards include but are not limited to i prohibitions on bonuses  retention awards and other incentive compensation  other than restricted stock grants which do not fully vest during the tarp period up to one third of an employee s total annual compensation  ii prohibitions on golden parachute payments for departure from a company  iii an expanded clawback of bonuses  retention awards  and incentive compensation if payment is based on materially inaccurate statements of earnings  revenues  gains or other criteria  iv prohibitions on compensation plans that encourage manipulation of reported earnings  v retroactive review of bonuses  retention awards and other compensation previously provided by tarp recipients if found by the us treasury to be inconsistent with the purposes of tarp or otherwise contrary to public interest  vi required establishment of a company wide policy regarding excessive or luxury expenditures  and vii inclusion in a participant s proxy statements for annual shareholder meetings of a nonbinding say on pay shareholder vote on the compensation of executives 
on february   the us treasury and the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a joint statement providing further guidance with respect to the capital assistance program cap announced february   including i that the cap will be initiated on february  and will include stress test assessments of major banks and that should the stress test indicate that an additional capital buffer is warranted  institutions will have an opportunity to turn first to private sources of capital  otherwise the temporary capital buffer will be made available from the government  ii such additional government capital will be in the form of mandatory convertible preferred shares  which would be converted into common equity shares only as needed over time to keep banks in a well capitalized position and can be retired under improved financial conditions before the conversion becomes mandatory  and iii previous capital injections under the cpp will also be eligible to be exchanged for the mandatory convertible preferred shares 
the conversion of preferred shares to common equity shares would enable institutions to maintain or enhance the quality of their capital by increasing their tangible common equity capital ratios  however  such conversions would necessarily dilute the interests of existing shareholders 
on february   the first day the cap program was initiated  the us treasury released the actual terms of the program  stating that the purpose of the cap is to restore confidence throughout the financial system that the nation s largest banking institutions have a sufficient capital cushion against larger than expected future losses  should they occur due to more a more severe economic environment  and to support lending to creditworthy borrowers 
under the cap terms  eligible us banking institutions with assets in excess of billion on a consolidated basis are required to participate in coordinated supervisory assessments  which are forward looking stress test assessments to evaluate the capital needs of the institution under a more challenging economic environment 
should this assessment indicate the need for the bank to establish an additional capital buffer to withstand more stressful conditions  these institutions may access the cap immediately as a means to establish any necessary additional buffer or they may delay the cap funding for six months to raise the capital privately 
eligible us banking institutions with assets below billion may also obtain capital from the cap 
the cap program is an additional program from the cpp and is open to eligible institutions regardless of whether they participated in the cpp 
the deadline to apply to the cap is may  recipients of capital under the cap will be subject to the same executive compensation requirements as if they had received the cpp 
on february   the fdic proposed amendments to the restoration plan for the deposit insurance fund 
this amendment proposes the imposition of a basis point emergency special assessment on insured depository institutions as of june  on march   fdic chairman sheila bair announced that if congress adopts legislation expanding the fdic s line of credit with treasury from billion to billion  the fdic might have the flexibility to reduce the special emergency assessment  possibly from to basis points 
the assessment is proposed to be collected on september  the interim rule would also permit the fdic to impose an emergency special assessment after june   of up to ten basis points if necessary to maintain public confidence in federal deposit insurance 
this special assessment if implemented as proposed will have a significant impact on the results of operations of the company for critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions including those related to the allowance for loan losses  contingencies including indemnifications  and deferred taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgements on the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are critical accounting policies that involve more significant judgements and estimates allowance for loan losses we maintain allowances for credit losses and charge losses to these allowances when realized 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgement reflecting our best estimate of probable loan losses related to specifically identified loans as well as those in the remaining loan portfolio 
our evaluation is based upon a continuing review of these portfolios  with consideration given to evaluations resulting from examinations performed by regulatory authorities 
as part of our problem loan management process  we may  from time to time  make decisions to protect our interests which may affect the basis in a problem loan or our estimate of the realizable value of a problem loan 
for example  to improve our first lien position in a non accrual loan  in august we purchased a note related to this non accrual loan from another lender for up to million 
related to the same credit  in august  we made a loan to an interested third party that is expected to add up to million to its estimated realizable value 
contingencies including indemnifications in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to legal actions  which involve claims for monetary relief 
based upon information presently available to us and our counsel  it is our opinion that any legal and financial responsibility arising from such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we maintain a loss contingency for standby letters of credit and charge losses to this reserve when such losses are realized 
the determination of the loss contingency for standby letters of credit requires significant judgement reflecting management s best estimate of probable losses 
the bank  as successor to originators of reverse mortgages is  from time to time  involved in arbitration or litigation with various parties including borrowers or the heirs of borrowers 
because reverse mortgages are a relatively new and uncommon product  there can be no assurances about how the courts or arbitrators may apply existing legal principles to the interpretation and enforcement of the terms and conditions of the bank s reverse mortgage obligations 
deferred taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires the recording of deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we have assessed our valuation allowances on deferred income taxes resulting from  among other things  limitations imposed by internal revenue code and uncertainties  including the timing of settlement and realization of these differences 
fair value measurements on january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
additionally  it establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a final consensus on issue  accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements 
in accordance with the eitf consensus  an agreement by an employer to share a portion of the proceeds of a life insurance policy with an employee during the postretirement period is a postretirement benefit arrangement required to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas or accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 omnibus opinion furthermore  the purchase of a split dollar life insurance policy does not constitute a settlement under sfas and  therefore  a liability for the postretirement obligation must be recognized under sfas if the benefit is offered under an arrangement that constitutes a plan or under accounting principles board no 
if it is not part of a plan 
the provisions of eitf issue are to be applied through either a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption or retrospective application 
we adopted this statement on january  and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
we adopted sfas on january  and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on november   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 written loan commitments recorded at fair value through earnings sab 
previously  sab  application of accounting principles to loan commitments  stated that in measuring the fair value of a derivative loan commitment  a company should not incorporate the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan 
sab supersedes sab and indicates that the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan should be included in measuring fair value for all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings 
sab also indicated that internally developed intangible assets should not be recorded as part of the fair value of a derivative loan commitment  and sab retains that view 
sab was effective for derivative loan commitments issued or modified in fiscal quarters beginning after december  and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing and funding activities 
to that end  we actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk exposure 
one measure required to be performed by the office of thrift supervision ots regulated institutions is the test specified by ots thrift bulletin no 
a  management of interest rate risk  investment securities and derivatives activities 
this test measures the impact on the net portfolio value of an immediate change in interest rates in basis point increments 
net portfolio value is defined as the net present value of the estimated cash flows from assets and liabilities as a percentage of the net present value of assets 
the following table is the estimated impact of immediate changes in interest rates on our net interest margin and net portfolio value at the specified levels at december  and  calculated in compliance with thrift bulletin no 
a december  change in interest rate basis points change in net interest margin net portfolio value change in net interest margin net portfolio value nmf nmf nmf nmf the percentage difference between net interest margin in a stable interest rate environment and net interest margin as projected under the various rate environment changes 
our net portfolio value in a stable interest rate environment and the net portfolio value as projected under the various rate environment changes 
sensitivity indicated by a decrease of and basis points may not be particularly meaningful nmf at december  given the historically low absolute level of interest rates at that date 
ots regulators are currently only monitoring rate shocks of to basis points 
our primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital  while maximizing the yield cost spread on our asset liability structure 
we rely primarily on our asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
we also engage in other business activities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for example  mortgage banking revenues and expenses can fluctuate with changing interest rates 
these fluctuations are difficult to model and estimate
