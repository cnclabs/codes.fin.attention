industry segment data certain financial information for the national security group s two operating segments life segment  property and casualty segment and holding company level expenses is summarized as follows amounts in thousands premium revenues life  accident and health insurance property and casualty insurance the property and casualty segment composed of total premium revenue in compared to in the property and casualty segment is primarily composed of dwelling fire and homeowners lines of business 
the property and casualty segment consists of the operations of national security fire and casualty company nsfc and omega one insurance company omega 
the life segment composed of premium revenue compared to in the life segment consists of the operations of national security insurance company nsic 
both the property and casualty segment and life segment experienced contractions in premium revenue in the continued deterioration of economic conditions led to increased lapse rates of existing policies and limited our ability to issue new business 
the following discussion outlines more specific information with regard to the individual operating segments of the company along with non insurance related information primarily administration expenses associated with the insurance holding company 
life and accident and health insurance operations the company s life  accident and health insurance business is conducted through national security insurance company nsic  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company organized in our life segment is the smaller of our insurance segments contributing of total insurance premium revenue in and in premium revenues and operating income for the life segment for the years ended december  and are summarized below amounts in thousands revenue net premiums earned net investment income net realized investment losses gains other income benefits and expenses policyholder benefits paid or provided amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs commissions general and administrative expenses insurance taxes  licenses and fees interest expense loss income before income taxes income tax benefit expense current deferred net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  nsic ended with premium revenue of  compared to  for the same period last year  a decrease of 
although premium revenue was down slightly overall  revenue in the independent agent method of distribution was over  with premium revenue up as compared to the home service method of distribution ended with a decline in premium revenue of compared to the prior year 
premium revenue in the life segment remained in a mode of moderate decline in the current economic downturn combined with the customer base we service with our products contributed to the overall negative impact on potential premium revenue growth 
our typical customer is in the middle income to lower income levels 
this group tends to be most severely impacted by economic downturns and reduces our customer s ability to purchase certain insurance products 
our customers also encounter competing alternatives for their spending dollars and sometimes are forced to reduce or eliminate certain insurance coverage when they have a reduction in household income 
nsic premium accounted for of total revenue for as mentioned above  nsic operates using two primary methods of distribution home service employee agents and independent agents 
while the company has used the traditional home service distribution process since its founding in  the independent agent distribution method has become the largest book of business for the life company 
for  the home service and independent agent distribution methods accounted for and  respectively of nsic premium revenue 
nsic ended with year to date net loss of  compared to a year to date net loss of  for the same period last year 
the primary factor contributing to the increase in net losses was an increase in unrealized capital losses due to other than temporary impairments on investments securities 
life insurance income was also reduced by other than temporary impairment losses totaling  during for information regarding management s method of determining investment impairment  please see the other than temporary impairment and credit quality section under investments on page property casualty operations the company s property and casualty insurance business is conducted through national security fire casualty company nsfc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company organized in  and omega one insurance company omega  a wholly owned subsidiary of national security fire casualty company organized in property and casualty operations constitute our largest segment composing and of our total premium revenue in and  respectively 
premium revenues and operating income for the p c segment for the years ended december  and are summarized below revenue net premiums earned net investment income net realized investment gains other income benefits and expenses policyholder benefits paid or provided amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs commissions general and administrative expenses insurance taxes  licenses and fees interest expense loss income before income taxes income tax benefit expense current deferred net loss income year ended december  compared to year ended december  premium revenues for the property and casualty segment were down compared to the same period last year 
the primary reasons for the decline were the increase in ceded premium related to the reinstatement premium for the catastrophe reinsurance agreement as well as the overall decline the company has experienced in new business over the past year 
the property and casualty segment incurred an increase in ceded premium triggered by hurricane gustav 
reinstatement premium related to this catastrophe increased ceded premium by over  during in addition  premium revenue declined due to a reduction in new business production 
the primary factor leading to the decline in new business production is the downturn in the overall economy 
our customer base consists primarily of middle to lower income individuals that are particularly adversely impacted by the current economic downturn 
we also continue to enhance underwriting standards which further limits new business production as we become more selective of the risks we undertake 
our rate structures are also routinely reviewed and continue to be closely monitored to ensure the p c companies are charging the appropriate rates for each product offered 
due to increased cost of reinsurance these reviews lead to significant rate increases in many of our coverage areas  further limiting our ability to grow new business but is intended to lead to improved underwriting profitability 
the slowing premium revenue growth affected both the dwelling fire and homeowner s lines of business 
the dwelling fire program was up moderately at while the homeowners program was down compared to the same period last year 
the reasons listed above were the primary factors contributing to the moderate rate of growth in the dwelling program and decline in the homeowners program 
the p c segment ended with a year to date pre tax net loss from underwriting of  compared to a pre tax underwriting income of  for the same period last year 
the unprecedented tornado and windstorm activity during the first half of combined with the losses incurred from hurricanes gustav and ike during september led to the underwriting losses for the year 
the p c companies were slammed with nineteen storms in the first half of which increased losses by almost  none of the storms were individually significant enough to reach our layers of reinsurance protection but cumulatively  significantly adversely impacted our underwriting profitability 
the reinsurance agreement for was structured with retention of  and the company retaining of losses between  and  two additional layers provide coverage up to  with one reinstatement 
gross losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred from hurricane gustav totaled   after reinsurance recoveries while gross losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred from hurricane ike totaled   after reinsurance recoveries 
net of reinsurance  total pre tax income was reduced by  from catastrophe related losses and loss adjustment expenses 
net of tax  catastrophe related losses totaled  and reduced net income by per share 
the catastrophe losses were the primary reason for the year to date underwriting losses in the dwelling and mobile homeowner lines of business 
these programs ended with underwriting losses of  and  respectively compared to underwriting income loss of  and  respectively for we routinely evaluate our claims frequency and severity statistics in order to better understand the nature of our risks and aid in the loss reserve liability evaluation process 
claims frequency is a measure of the number of claims incurred during a measurement period regardless of amount 
claims severity is a measure of the average dollar amount of claims during a measurement period 
the severity of claims related to the nineteen catastrophic storms affecting the p c companies during totaled approximately  per claim while the average severity of claims related to hurricanes gustav and ike totaled  and  respectively 
the p c segment continued to be involved in litigation pertaining to claims from hurricane katrina which slammed into louisiana and mississippi in august during  the claims associated with hurricane katrina exceeded the  million limit of the reinsurance agreement in affect during as of december   claims related to hurricane katrina exceeded the reinsurance cap by just under  the primary reason the company exceeded the maximum reinsurance available under the contract was due to assessments by the mississippi windstorm underwriting association totaling over  although the reinsurance for this catastrophe has been exhausted and the ultimate outcome of these claims is unknown  the company believes it maintains adequate reserves for the open claims based on information available at the present time 
additional adverse development related to the claims in litigation is possible and therefore these files are carefully monitored on a continuous basis 
the company currently has open claims related to hurricane katrina 
we have a small commercial auto program that showed improved results ending with a year to date underwriting income of  compared to an underwriting loss of  for the same period last year 
the primary reason for the improved results was a reduction in average severity as one litigation claim in led to significantly higher incurred losses in the program 
the loss ratio in this program decreased from in to in  an percentage point decrease 
the p c segment was also impacted by the write down of other than temporary impairments 
during  other than temporary impairment losses totaled  in nsfc and  in omega one 
for information regarding management s method of determining investment impairment  please see the other than temporary impairment and credit quality section under investments on page the combined ratio for was negatively impacted by the unprecedented storm activity  the decrease in premium revenue and the other than temporary impairments recognized during the year 
for  the combined ratio was compared to for the components of this ratio are broken out in the table below under the section property and casualty combined ratio 
property casualty combined ratio a measure used to analyze a property casualty insurer s underwriting performance is the combined ratio 
it is the sum of two ratios a 
the loss and loss expense ratio  which measures losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of premium revenue 
b 
the underwriting expense ratio  which measures underwriting expenses incurred eg  agents commissions  premium taxes  and other administrative underwriting expenses as a percentage of premium revenue 
the results of these ratios for the past two years were loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio maintaining a combined ratio below  which indicates that the company is making an underwriting profit  depends upon many factors including hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico and the southern atlantic coast  strict underwriting of risks  and adequate and timely premium rates 
a major hurricane hitting the coast of alabama  georgia  south carolina  mississippi  louisiana  or texas could cause the combined ratio to fluctuate materially from prior years 
the property and casualty subsidiaries maintain catastrophe reinsurance to minimize the effect of a major catastrophe 
as discussed previously  catastrophe losses related to tornado and windstorm outbreaks in the first half of coupled with losses in september from hurricane gustav and hurricane ike were the primary factors contributing to the significant increase in the combined ratio 
tornado and windstorm losses totaling  incurred in the first half of added percentage points to the combined ratio 
losses  net of reinsurance recoveries  from hurricane gustav totaled  and added percentage points to the combined ratio 
losses  net of reinsurance recoveries  from hurricane ike totaled  and added percentage points to the combined ratio

these dividends are eliminated upon consolidation of the subsidiaries in the audited financials included herein 
the expenses of the group consist of expenses associated with the public listing of our stock  taxes and fees  and directors fees 
the most significant expense of the group is interest expense associated with  in debt 
this debt is composed of two trust preferred securities offerings  the first being  issued in the december and the second being  issued in june the primary use for these proceeds was to add capital to the property and casualty 
total interest expense for the group associated with these borrowings in was  compared to  in discontinued operations discontinued operations consist of the operations of mobile attic inc on april   the national security group  inc entered into an agreement with a private investment group to sell ninety percent of its fifty percent equity interest in mobile attic  inc total cash proceeds from the sale were  and the net gain on the disposal totaled  under the terms of the agreement  nsg transferred assets of approximately  consisting primarily of portable storage leasing equipment 
nsg was also released from debt obligations totaling  consisting primarily of short term debt used to finance portable storage leasing equipment 
investments the life insurance and property casualty subsidiaries primarily invest in highly liquid investment grade debt and equity securities 
at december   the company s holdings in debt securities amounted to of total investments and of total assets 
the following is a breakdown of the bond portfolio quality according to the nationally recognized rating organization equivalents of standard and poor s bond portfolio ratings s p or equivalent ratings of total bond portfolio aaa aa aa a a a bbb bbb bb in default a summary of debt and equity securities available for sale with unrealized losses as of december  along with related fair value  aggregated by length of time that the investments have been in a continuous unrealized loss position follows dollars in thousands december  less than months months or longer total gross gross gross total fair unrealized fair unrealized fair unrealized securities in a value losses value losses value losses loss position fixed maturities corporate mortgage backed securities private label mortgage backed securities obligations of state and political subdivisions us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies equity securities other than temporary impairments and credit quality at december  less than of total investments in the fixed income portfolio were classified as below investment grade 
in determining whether or not unrealized losses are other than temporary impairments  the company does not use set thresholds as exclusive reliance on thresholds removes the ability of management to apply its judgment  a concept that is inherent to the analysis of impairments 
all unrealized losses are reviewed to determine whether the losses are other than temporary 
management utilizes positive and negative information on an investment by investment basis to make the determination as to whether an unrealized loss is other than temporary 
items that are considered include the nature of the investment  the cause or causes of the impairment  the number of investment positions that are in an unrealized loss position  the severity and duration of the impairment  industry analyst reports  credit ratings  volatility of the security s fair value  whether the securities are backed by the us government or its agencies  the company s intent and ability to hold the security and other factors deemed relevant by management 
management has evaluated each security in a significant unrealized loss position 
most unrealized losses in the fixed income portfolio are interest rate and market driven as opposed to credit quality driven and management believes  based on current information  that no ultimate loss will be realized on the securities not considered to the other than temporarily impaired 
the company has no material exposure to sub prime mortgage loans and less than of the fixed income investment portfolio is rated below investment grade 
for the year ended december    in other than temporary impairments were realized by the company 
of the remaining securities in loss positions at december   the most significant securities in a loss position were in the equity portfolio 
six securities were in accumulated loss positions for greater than months 
the single largest accumulated loss in the equity portfolio totaled  the second and third largest loss positions totaled  and  respectively 
in evaluating whether or not the loss positions in the equity portfolio were other than temporary impairments  management evaluated financial information on each company and reviewed analyst reports from at least two independent sources 
based on a review of the available financial information  the prospect for future earnings of each company and consideration of the company s intent and ability to hold the securities until market values recovered  it was determined that the remaining securities in an accumulated loss position in the portfolio were temporary impairments 
the amortized cost and aggregate fair value of debt securities at december   by contractual maturity  are as follows 
expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties 
dollars in thousands amortized fair available for sale securities cost value due in one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years through ten years due after ten years total held to maturity securities due in one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years through ten years due after ten years total the amortized cost and aggregate fair values of investment securities are as follows dollars in thousands december  gross gross amortized unrealized unrealized fair cost gains losses value available for sale securities corporate debt securities mortgage backed securities private label mortgage backed securities obligations of states and political subdivisions us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies total fixed maturities equity securities total held to maturity securities corporate debt securities mortgage backed securities private label mortgage backed securities obligations of states and political subdivisions us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies total december  gross gross amortized unrealized unrealized fair cost gains losses value available for sale securities corporate debt securities mortgage backed securities private label mortgage backed securities obligations of states and political subdivisions us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies total fixed maturities equity securities total held to maturity securities corporate debt securities mortgage backed securities private label mortgage backed securities obligations of states and political subdivisions us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies total mortgage backed security investments the insurance subsidiaries fixed maturity securities include residential mortgage backed securities rmbs of million and million at amortized value at december  and respectively 
the fair value of the rmbs portfolio was million and million at december  and respectively 
we own no commercial mortgage backed securities or material amounts of sub prime rmbs s in our investment portfolio 
the mortgage backed bonds are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans 
prepayments cause those securities to have different actual maturities than were expected at the time of purchase 
securities that are purchased at a premium to par value and prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or loss 
securities that are purchased at a discount to par value and prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or gain 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between amortized cost and par value  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayments in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure 
in order to minimize risk associated with prepayments on collateralized mortgage obligations  the company typically invests primarily in more predictable planned amortization class pac structures of cmo s and typically avoids investment in cmo s priced at significant premiums above par value 
as for the composition of the rmbs portfolio  agency mortgage backed securities compose and of the rmbs portfolio at december  and  respectively 
the remainder of the rmbs portfolio is composed of private label mortgage backed securities 
these securities consist primarily of conventional and year loans with an average borrower fico score of we own no mortgage backed securities backed by subprime loans and less than of the rmbs portfolio is composed of loans subject to rate resets 
one security in the private label mortgage backed security portfolio is rated below investment grade and it composes less than of the rmbs portfolio 
investment portfolio income investment returns with respect to the investment portfolio for the years ended december  and follows year ended december  net investment income average current yield on investments total return on investments net realized losses gains on investments before taxes change in accumulated net unrealized gains before income taxes unrealized capital losses on investments of  was primarily due to decreases in value of corporate debt securities and private label mortgage backed securities available for sale 
as discussed previously  management evaluated these investments for potential other than temporary impairments and believes that  based on currently available information  the securities will ultimately recover and the company has the intent and ability to hold until recovery 
the most significant change in investment income in compared to was an increase in realized capital losses and an increase in unrealized capital losses 
the most significant component contributing to the realized capital losses in were other than temporary impairment charges totaling  details of the individual issuers composing the other than temporary impairment charges are as follows other than temporary impairments issuer par value otti loss lehman brothers washington mutual harborview mortgage american general fhlmc pfd fnma pfd liquidity and capital resources due to regulatory restrictions  the majority of the company s cash is required to be invested in investment grade securities to provide ample protection for policyholders 
the liabilities of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are of various terms and  therefore  those subsidiaries invest in securities with various maturities spread over periods usually not exceeding years 
the liabilities of the life insurance subsidiary are typically of a longer duration  and therefore  a higher percentage of securities in the life insurance subsidiary are invested for periods exceeding years 
the liquidity requirements for the company are primarily met by funds generated from operations of the life insurance and property casualty insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets provide the primary sources of cash for both the life and property casualty businesses  while applications of cash are applied by both businesses to the payment of policy benefits  the cost of acquiring new business principally commissions  operating expenses  purchases of new investments  and in the case of life insurance  policy loans 
as of december   the maturity schedule for all bonds and notes held by the company  stated at amortized cost  was as follows maturity schedule amounts in thousands maturity available for sale held to maturity total percentage of total maturity in less than year maturity in years maturity in years maturity after years it should be noted that the above table represents maturities based on stated maturity 
due to call and prepayment features inherent in some debt securities  actual repayment will differ from stated maturities 
the company routinely evaluates the impact of changing interest rates on the projected maturities of bonds in the portfolio and actively manages the portfolio in order to minimize the impact of interest rate risk 
the national security group s consolidated statement of cash flows indicates that operating activities used provided cash of  and  in and  respectively 
the considerable decrease in cash flow from operating activities in compared to is primarily due to an increase in payments of insurance claims associated with various catastrophe losses incurred during the year  most notably among the catastrophe events were hurricane ike and hurricane gustav which both occurred in september of the consolidated statement of cash flows reflects cash provided by investing activities of  in and used in investing activities of  in the provision of cash from investing activities in was primarily due to liquidity needs generated by increased claim activity in the property and casualty subsidiaries 
in positive cash flow generated by insurance operations led to an increase in cash used in investing activities as more investments were purchased 
the consolidated statement of cash flows also reflects a decrease in cash from financing activities of  and  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities in reflect the repayment of  in short term debt and dividend payments to shareholders of  cash flows from financing activities in reflect proceeds from a trust preferred securities offering of  repayment of debt of  and shareholder dividends of  the following table reflects the anticipated cash flows associated with our short and long term contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations and commitments payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years debt obiligations interest on debt obligations property and casualty claim reserves future life insurance obligations to be calculated long term debt  consisting of two separate issues of trust preferred securities  is assumed to be settled at contractual maturity 
interest on long term debt is calculated using the interest rates in effect at december  for each issue 
interest on long term debt is accrued and settled quarterly 
therefore  the timing and amount of interest payments may vary from the calculated value included in the table above 
these calculations do not take into account any potential prepayments 
for additional information regarding long term debt and interest on long term debt  please see note  notes payable and long term debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the anticipated payout of property and casualty claim reserves  which includes loss and loss adjustment expenses  are based upon historical payout patterns 
both the timing and amount of these payments may vary from the payment indicated 
future life insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments and surrender benefits on policies inforce at december  these estimated payments are computed using assumptions for future mortality  morbidity and persistency 
in contrast to this table  the majority of life s obligations is recorded on the balance sheet at the current account values and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth  interest crediting or future deposits 
therefore  the estimated future life insurance obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
due to the significance of the assumptions used  the actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts 
management believes that current assets  future premiums and investment income will be sufficient to fund all future life insurance obligations 
included in long term debt held by the company is the issuance of  in subordinated debentures completed on december  the proceeds from the debentures were used to make a  capital infusion in the p c subsidiary national security fire and casualty with the remainder to be held for general corporate purposes 
the subordinated debentures mature december  it is anticipated that principal payments will not be made until the expiration of the fixed rate period on the debt in also included in long term debt is the issuance of  in subordinated debentures completed june  the proceeds from the debentures were used to fund general corporate expenses thereby reducing the amount of dividends to the group paid by the p c subsidiary national security fire casualty thereby continuing to restore capital in the p c subsidiary national security fire and casualty to pre hurricane levels 
the second issue matures june  and may be redeemed following the fifth anniversary of issuance 
in estimating the time interval for payment of property and casualty claim reserves  the company utilized historical payment patterns 
by the nature of the insurance contracts under which these liabilities exist  there can be no certainty that actual payments will fall in the periods indicated above 
however  management believes that current liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to pay these obligations as they come due 
also  due to the relatively short tail nature of the majority of the company s claim liabilities  management can conclude with a reasonable level of confidence that historical patterns indicate that approximately of claim liabilities at the end of a given year are settled within the following two year period 
the ability of the company to meet its commitments for timely payment of claims and other expenses depends  in addition to current cash flow  on the liquidity of its investments 
the company has relatively little exposure to lower grade fixed income investments which might be especially subject to liquidity problems due to thinly traded markets 
except as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is aware of no known trends  events  or uncertainties reasonably likely to have a material effect on its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
additionally  the company has not been made aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities  which if implemented  would have such an effect 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in  the amount that the national security group s insurance subsidiaries can transfer in the form of dividends to the parent company is limited to  in the life insurance subsidiary and  in the property casualty insurance subsidiary 
due to a decline in capital position in the subsidiaries  the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company has been reduced 
however  the decreased capital levels pose no short term threat to our ability to fund the obligations of the parent company 
should capital levels continue to decline in  the threat of further stockholder dividend reductions could materialize 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no material off balance sheet arrangements 
statutory risk based capital of insurance subsidiaries the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for life health and property casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
state insurance regulators will use the rbc formula as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines minimum capital standards that will supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the company s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within levels  each of which requires corrective action 
the levels and ratios are as follows ratio of total adjusted capital authorized control level rbc regulatory event less than or equal to company action level regulatory action level authorized control level mandatory control level the ratios of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc for the national security group s life health and property casualty insurance subsidiaries are all in excess of to at december  national security insurance company life insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  national security insurance company exceeds the minimum rbc requirements 
national security fire casualty company property casualty insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  national security fire casualty company exceeds the minimum rbc requirements 
omega one insurance company property casualty insurer  which began writing business in late  has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and  respectively 
accordingly  omega one insurance company exceeds the minimum rbc requirements 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based upon the development and application of accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
accounting policies may be based on including but not limited to gaap authoritative literature  statutory authoritative literature  regulations and industry standards 
the company s financial results would be directly impacted by changes in assumptions and judgments used to select and apply our accounting policies 
it is management s opinion that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in regards to the application of our accounting policies and their affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
reinsurance receivables deferred policy acquisition costs deferred taxes valuation of investments reserves for losses and loss adjustment expense recognition of revenue evaluation of litigation reinsurance risk management involves ceding risks to reinsurers for policies underwritten based on contractual agreements 
the reinsurance purchased helps provide protection by individual loss or catastrophic event when claims exceed specified amounts 
although the reinsurance protects our company in the event a loss penetrates into a particular reinsurance agreement  ultimate responsibility for claim settlement rests with our company if any reinsurer defaults on payments due 
we record an asset for reinsurance recoverable on the financials for amounts due from reinsurers and monitor the balances due by reinsurer to ensure the asset is ultimately going to be collectible 
if we discover an amount due may not be received we remove the balance and charge it to an allowance for doubtful accounts or charge it off to expense based on the information available at the time 
when a claim is made under a policy we have reinsured  we initially pay the full amount owed to the policyholder or claimant 
subsequently  we initiate the process to recover any amounts due from reinsurers in accordance with the terms of applicable reinsurance treaties 
reinsurance is maintained by the life and accident and health segment for losses that exceed  for any one insured 
nsfc and omega generally reinsure with third parties any liability in excess of  on any single policy 
in addition  the property and casualty segment holds a catastrophe contract which covers losses related to a catastrophic event with multiple policyholders affected 
in the event a catastrophe exceeds the million retention stated in the contract  reinsurers will reimburse the company co pay of gross losses and loss adjustment expenses paid up to million layer one and layer two of the contract 
if losses exceed million  the contract allows for reimbursement of losses and loss adjustment expenses up to million 
any losses above the million cap are the responsibility of our company 
the contract in place during also allowed one reinstatement for coverage under the contract for a second catastrophic event if needed 
the contract provided protection up to at least a year near term event as depicted in catastrophe modeling results 
the near term catastrophe modeling results reflect a predicted increase in storm activity given the current weather pattern and various factors projected to impact our weather patterns in the near term 
we believe that maintaining protection to at least a year near term event will be comparable with our past practice of maintaining catastrophe reinsurance protection up to a year event under the previous models 
during  our company incurred losses from hurricane gustav which reached the first and second layer of the catastrophe contract 
in addition  hurricane ike losses and loss adjustment expenses also exceeded million forcing the company to use the reinstatement under the contract to cover losses for this storm as well 
at december   the estimated reinsurance recoverable recorded was  compared to  for the same period last year 
the company does not anticipate any issues with collection of the recorded amount 
the reinsurance related amounts recorded have been estimated based upon management s interpretation of the related reinsurance treaty 
areas in which judgment has been used regarding said estimates include assessing the financial viability and credit quality of each reinsurer as well as the ability of each reinsurer to pay amounts owed 
there is a possibility that the actual amounts recovered from reinsurers could be materially less than the estimates recorded 
this possibility could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
reinsurers may dispute claims under reinsurance treaties  such as the calculated amount of reinsurance recoverable 
management does not anticipate any issues with recoverability of reinsurance balances based on current evaluations of collectability 
for more information regarding reinsurance  please see the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs dac are those costs incurred in connection with acquiring new business or renewing existing business 
dac is primarily comprised of commissions  premium taxes  and underwriting costs associated with issuing new policies 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  these costs are not expensed in their entirety at policy inception  rather they are recorded as an asset and amortized over the lives of the policies 
a reduction in dac is recognized if the sum of the expected loss and loss adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and projected investment income 
management reviews dac calculations throughout the year to establish and assess their recoverability 
changes in management s assumptions  estimates or judgment with respect to calculating dac could materially impact our financial statements and financial condition 
changes in loss ratios  projected investment income  premium rates or overall expense levels could negatively impact the recoverability of dac 
at december  and  the company recorded  and  respectively  as an asset for dac in the financial statements 
we do not foresee any issues related to recoverability of these capitalized costs 
for more information regarding deferred policy acquisition costs  please see note to our financial statements 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are created when there are differences between assets and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes  as well as tax credits  net operating losses and other carry forwards 
sfas accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
this standard requires management to exercise judgment in determining whether or not the deferred tax asset is realizable 
at december   there is no evidence to suggest to management that any deferred tax asset is unrealizable 
for more information regarding deferred income taxes  please see note to our financial statements 
valuation of investments investments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted prices when available 
quoted prices are available for most investment debt and equity securities included in the financial statements 
further discussion of fair value methodology is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
periodically  the carrying values of an individual investment may become temporarily impaired because of time value  volatility  credit quality and existing market conditions 
management evaluates investments to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary 
evaluation criteria include credit quality of security  severity of decrease between cost and market value  length of time of the impairment and likelihood that the impairment will reverse in the near future 
this evaluation requires significant assumptions  estimates and judgments by management 
if the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to the current fair value and a realized loss is recorded on the income statement 
we have very limited exposure to less liquid and difficult to value investments such as collateralized debt obligations 
loss and loss adjustment expense property and casualty loss reserves are maintained to cover the estimated unpaid liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported incurred claims 
loss reserves are an estimation based on actuarial projection techniques common in the insurance industry 
reserves are management s expectations of what the settlement and administration of claims will cost 
management estimated reserves are based on historical settlement patterns  estimated salvage and subrogation  and an appraisal of the related facts and circumstances 
management s reserve estimates are reviewed by consulting actuaries to determine their adequacy and reasonableness 
the reserve analysis performed by management is reviewed by the actuaries during the third quarter each year with a final comprehensive review and actuarial sign off performed at year end 
at december  and  the recorded liability for loss and loss and adjustment expense was  and  respectively 
the increase for was the result of higher claim activity from the nineteen tornado and windstorm events that affected the p c companies in addition to the substantial losses incurred from both hurricanes gustav and ike 
we believe the estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to be sufficient based on currently available information and a review of our historical reserving practices 
for more information regarding loss and loss adjustment expense  see note to our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under smaller reporting company rules we are not required to disclose information required under item a 
however  in order to provide information to our investors  we have elected to provide information related to market risk 
the company s primary objectives in managing its investment portfolio are to maximize investment income and total investment returns while minimizing overall credit risk 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including changes in interest rates  overall market conditions  underwriting results  regulatory requirements and tax position 
investment decisions are made by management and reviewed by the board of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in fair value of securities 
the three potential risks related to the company s fixed maturity portfolio are interest rate risk  prepayment risk and default risk 
the primary risk related to the company s equity portfolio is equity price risk 
since the company s assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  the company s financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities  changes in spreads over us treasuries on new investment opportunities and changes in the yield curve and equity pricing risks 
the company is exposed to equity price risk on its equity securities 
the company holds common stock with a fair value of million 
based on an evaluation of the historical risk measure of our portfolio relative to the s p  if the market value of the s p index decreased from its december  value  the fair value of the company s common stock would decrease by approximately  certain fixed interest rate market risk sensitive instruments may not give rise to incremental income or loss during the period illustrated but may be subject to changes in fair values 
note and in the consolidated financial statements presents additional disclosures concerning fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities and is incorporated by reference herein 
the company limits the extent of its market risk by purchasing securities that are backed by stable collateral  the majority of the assets are issued by us government sponsored entities 
also  the majority of all of the subsidiaries cmo s are planned amortization class pac bonds 
pac bonds are typically the lowest risk cmo s  and provide greater cash flow predictability 
such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield  but higher liquidity  than higher risk mortgage backed bonds 
to reduce the risk of losing principal should prepayments exceed expectations  the company does not purchase mortgage backed securities at significant premiums over par value 
the company s investment approach in the equity markets is based primarily on a fundamental analysis of value 
this approach requires the investment committee to invest in well managed  primarily dividend paying companies  which have a low debt to capital ratio  above average return on capital for a sustained period of time  and low volatility rating beta relative to the market 
the dividends provide a steady cash flow to help pay current claim liabilities  and it has been the company s experience that by following this investment strategy  long term investment results have been superior to those offered by bonds  while keeping the risk of loss of capital to a minimum relative to the overall equity market 
as for shifts in investment allocations  the company has moderately increased allocations to corporate and tax free bonds 
the improved yield spreads on corporate bonds has made this segment more attractive and the risk of investing in corporate bonds versus government bonds is more appropriately priced in our opinion 
we have also increased our allocation to tax free securities to further enhance after tax returns given our improved earnings performance over the last two years
