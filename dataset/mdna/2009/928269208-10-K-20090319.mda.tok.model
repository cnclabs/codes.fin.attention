item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with virtualscopics consolidated balance sheet  and related consolidated statements of operations  consolidated changes in stockholders equity and cash flow for the years ended december  and  included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  the accuracy of which involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements for many reasons including  but not limited to  those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
we disclaim any obligation to update information contained in any forward looking statements 
overview virtualscopics  inc is a leading provider of imaging solutions to accelerate drug and medical device development 
we have developed a robust software platform for analysis and modeling of both structural and functional medical images 
in combination with our industry leading experience and expertise in advanced imaging biomarker measurement  this platform provides a uniquely clear window into the biological activity of drugs and devices in clinical trial patients  allowing our customers to make better decisions faster 
in july  virtualscopics was formed after being spun out of the university of rochester 
in june  we purchased the underlying technology and patents created by virtualscopics founders from the university of rochester 
we own all rights to the patents underlying its technology 
since our inception  our principal activities have consisted of research and development  providing imaging related services within the pharmaceutical industry  business development of customer and strategic relationships  and raising capital 
revenue over the past seven years has been derived primarily from image processing services in connection with pharmaceutical drug trials 
for these services  we have been concentrating in the areas of oncology and osteoarthritis 
we have also derived a small portion of revenue from consulting services  and pharmaceutical drug trials in the neurology and cardiovascular areas 
we expect that the concentration of our revenue will continue in these services and in those areas in revenues are recognized as the mri and ct images that we process are quantified and delivered to our customers and or the services are performed 
once we enter into a new contract for participation in a drug trial  there are several factors that can effect whether we will realize the full benefits under the contract  and the time over which we will realize that revenue 
customers may not continue our services due to performance reasons with their compounds in development 
furthermore  the contracts may contemplate performance over multiple years 
therefore  revenue may not be realized in the fiscal year in which the contract is signed 
recognition of revenue under the contract may also be affected by the timing of patient recruitment and image site identification and training 
results of operations results of operations for year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue we had revenues of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   representing a increase 
the increase in revenues is directly related to the growing demand for our services in the industry 
we continue to see growing demand for our oncology analysis services as well as demand within the medical device industry 
during we performed work for customers  representing different projects  in connection with their pharmaceutical drug trials primarily in the fields of oncology and musculoskeletal diseases osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis along with various other projects 
as of december   we had active projects with of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the world 
the majority of the pharmaceutical projects for which we have performed work to date are in pre clinical  phase i or phase ii studies 
in  we expect that a majority of our work on pharmaceutical trial projects will continue to be focused in phase ii and iii 
during  we generated approximately million in revenues for our customers in phase i  ii  and iii  this compares to approximately million in  a increase 
gross profit we had a gross profit of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the comparable period in our gross profit improved year over year due to the greater amount of work performed on later stage clinical trials  efficiencies made within our operations  and the reduction in work force at the end of later stage trials phase ii iii typically have more analysis due to the patient population of the study  as a result  we tend to have greater economies of scale because of the repetitive nature of the work we perform 
we believe we can continue to generate near gross margins as we scale the business and therefore  we do not anticipate significant additional investments to be made within our operational infrastructure in research and development research and development costs decreased in by  or  to  when compared to the decrease was largely attributed to the reduction in employees with our research and development area 
during  we began seeing heightened demand for our services in later stage clinical trials and less heavily on research projects as our technology and services became more widely used in the industry and less early stage proof of concept work was necessary 
as a larger percentage of our projects were in later stage clinical trials as opposed to research pre clinical studies less time was required of the research group to work on customer projects 
additionally  we determined at that time that additional internal funding of research projects was not necessary 
as a result  at the end of  we realigned our research group to better reflect the market demand for our services 
as of december   there were nine employees in our research and development group  this includes the algorithm and software development groups 
our research and development efforts are centered around improving the functionality of our existing algorithms and software platform as well as the refinement of our algorithms to new therapeutic areas 
sales and marketing sales and marketing costs increased in by  to  when compared to the increase was a result of marketing efforts during the first half of due to the changing nature of our business and the customers we target  we re branded our marketing materials in order to have a consistent and representative reflection of the services we provide and the value it generates for our customers 
our previous marketing efforts were centered around the technology as opposed to the benefits for our customers 
as of the date of this report  there are four individuals in our sales and marketing department 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  when compared to the decrease is mainly due to the  decrease in stock compensation expense due to the timing and valuation of the vesting of outstanding stock options 
also contributing to the decrease in general and administrative costs was a reduction in our spending on public and investor relations during compared to in  the company raised million in a convertible series b offering which led to higher costs incurred on investor outreach 
legal costs were also lower in as a result of settling of a legal matter with a former executive in early depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization charges decreased for the year ended december  by  or  to  when compared to this decrease is attributed to slight declines in the amortization and depreciation of patents and computer equipment 
the amortization and depreciation schedules are based on the timing and life of the patent costs and equipment 
we continue to invest in our patent portfolio and computer systems  however  do not anticipate significant expenditures necessary in either area to support our current business 
interest expense income  net interest income for the year ended december  was  representing interest derived on the company s operating and savings accounts  compared to interest income of  in the decrease in interest income was due to lower rates of return earned on our investment accounts 
other expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
this decrease in interest expense was due to quarterly payments on loans from certain virtualscopics stockholders 
the loans were fully paid as of december net loss our net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  the decrease in our net loss over the prior period was related to higher revenues  better gross margin and reduced spending in research and development  as planned and outlined above 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios and eitf  application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments  the series b convertible preferred stock was considered to have an embedded beneficial conversion feature because the conversion price was less than the fair value of the company s common stock at the issuance date 
this beneficial conversion feature is calculated after the warrants have been valued with proceeds allocated on a relative value basis 
the series b convertible preferred stock was fully convertible beginning on november  and the value of the beneficial conversion feature was recorded as a deemed dividend 
as a result  the net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december  was  including series b preferred stock deemed dividend of  no similar beneficial conversion feature was recorded in liquidity and capital resources our working capital as of december  and was approximately  and  respectively 
the decrease in working capital was a result of the million private placement of newly issued series b preferred stock that occurred september  thereby increasing the cash position at the end of the private placement resulted in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
a portion of the capital was spent in on sales and marketing efforts as well as supporting some of the development efforts 
on september   as mentioned above  we completed a private placement of  shares of series b convertible preferred stock  par value per share  and warrants to purchase the company s common stock  par value per share  for an aggregate purchase price of  at the time of the closing  we were required to restrict cash equal to ten percent of the stated value of the series b convertible preferred stock that are outstanding  or  for the payment of dividends plus  for the payment of investor relation services over the next two years 
as of december   the company had  in cash restricted for dividend payments and investor relations services 
as of december   the restricted balance has been fully spent and no further restrictions of our cash on hand exist 
net cash used in operating activities totaled  in compared to  in this significant decrease in the amount of cash used on operating activities was primarily the result of the increase in our revenues and reduction in expenses in as compared to also impacting the change from prior year was the timing of our receivables  accounts payable and accrued expenses and advance billings from customers  which is reflected in deferred revenue 
as we perform the services to our customers  revenue is recognized and offset against deferred revenue 
we invested  in the purchase of equipment and the acquisition of patents in  compared to  for the investment of these items in this decrease largely represents a decrease in furniture and leasehold improvement costs in due to a relocation of facilities in which created higher than average costs 
we anticipate that our it related costs will increase in as we continue to experience greater demand from our customers 
during  we incurred  in patent costs associated with filing costs for intellectual property  as compared to  in net cash provided by our financing activities in was  compared to net cash provided by our financing activities of  in this decrease was due to the private placement of our series b convertible preferred stock issued in september  as described above 
we currently expect that existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our existing operations for the next months 
if in the next months our plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to seek additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings 
if we need to raise additional funds  we may not be able to do so on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if we cannot raise sufficient funds on acceptable terms  we may have to curtail our level of expenditures and our rate of expansion 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  other than the consulting agreements and operating leases as described in contractual obligations below that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect that is material to investors on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital resources or capital expenditures 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  which we expect to have an effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
see item description of property for a full description of our lease obligations which includes a portion of the lease to be paid in our common stock 
payments due by period less than total year years operating leases the company entered into a services and co marketing agreement dated march   in which it agreed to pay chondrometrics gmbh  a german limited liability company  fees equal to approximately of the gross revenues it derived from certain services each year throughout the term of the agreement 
the company was obligated to make minimum payments to chondrometrics for the first three years of the agreement 
payments made to chondrometrics in and amounted to  and  respectively 
there was no minimum payment required in the agreement terminated on december  critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
the following accounting policies are important in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
patents costs incurred to acquire and file for patents  including legal costs  are capitalized as long lived assets and amortized on a straight line basis over the lower of the estimated useful life or legal life of the patent  which is years 
impairment of long lived assets the company adopted sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
long lived assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment if the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted cash flows of the assets 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
management does not believe that there is any impairment of long lived assets at december  revenue recognition the company applies the revenue recognition principles set forth under the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  with respect to its revenues from image analysis  consulting and project data management services  and recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when an agreement exists  services and products are provided to the customer  prices are fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues are reduced for estimated discounts and other allowances  if any 
the company provides advanced medical image analysis on a per image basis  and recognizes revenue when the image analysis is completed and delivered to the customer 
revenue related to project  data and site management services is recognized as the services are rendered and in accordance with the terms of the contract 
consulting revenue is recognized once the services are rendered and typically charged as an hourly rate 
occasionally  the company provides software development services to its customers  which may require significant development  modification  and customization 
software development revenue is billed on a fixed price basis and recognized upon delivery of the software and acceptance by the customer on a completed contract basis in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the company does not sell software licenses  upgrades or enhancements  or post contract customer services 
reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred are reported as revenue in the financial statements in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred
