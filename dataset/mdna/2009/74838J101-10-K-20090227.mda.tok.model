item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that involve material risks and uncertainties 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with a warning about forward looking statements on page and risk factors under item a of this annual report 
in addition  our discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of quidel corporation in this item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
executive summary we have a leadership position in the development  manufacturing and marketing of rapid diagnostic solutions for decentralized applications including point of care poc in infectious diseases and reproductive and women s health 
we focus on poc testing solutions specifically developed for the physician office lab pol and acute care markets globally 
we sell our products to professionals for use in physician offices  hospitals  clinical laboratories  retail clinics and wellness screening centers 
we market our products in the us through a network of national and regional distributors  supported by a direct sales force 
internationally  we sell and market primarily in japan  europe and the middle east through exclusive distributor arrangements 
a majority of our total revenues relate to three product families 
for the years ended december   and  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenues from sales of our influenza  group a strep and pregnancy tests 
additionally  a significant portion of our total revenue is from a relatively small number of distributors 
approximately  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively  were related to sales through our five largest distributors in each of those periods 
we also develop research products through our specialty products group the spg with an emphasis on potential future rapid test applications 
the spg is currently responsible for more than of our clinical and research products used worldwide in reference laboratories and in research applications at leading universities and biotechnology companies 
the spg revenues  income and assets are less than of our overall operations 
our net revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this was largely driven by increased domestic sales of our infectious disease products  partially offset by a decrease in our reproductive and women s health  and other products 
we are continuing to focus our efforts to strengthen market and brand leadership in infectious disease and reproductive and women s health by delivering economic and clinical proof through our efforts with our quidel value build qvb program 
our poc testing solutions are designed to provide specialized results that meet two important value criteria that we have branded as qvb clinical validation the enabling of rapid patient management decisions leading to improved treatment and outcomes 
economic validation the reduction of overall costs associated with patient testing with emphasis upon critical reimbursement and payer performance criteria 
we focus on ensuring market leadership and providing points of differentiation by specializing in the diagnosis and monitoring of selected disease states 
in order to support our value proposition as a company that markets the highest quality products in support of better medical outcomes  we are highlighting our qvb through the development of new innovations and the communication of new solutions in the field of rapid diagnostic testing 
our qvb includes significant work in understanding the needs of the end use customer  building products that meet those needs  providing proof studies to validate rapid diagnostic testing at the point of care and leveraging the work of researchers and key opinion leaders studying our tests and technology to help enhance the health and well being of people around the globe 
our marketing strategy includes ensuring that our key product portfolios are supported by economic and clinical validation that shows hospitals  acute care facilities and poc clinicians that these tests deliver high quality results in a cost effective manner 
we believe that the trend among healthcare providers to adopt poc testing continues to increase  and demographic changes  reimbursement policies  a shortage of skilled laboratory workers and the availability of clinically valuable tests will increase growth in this diagnostic category 
more and more employers  health plans and payers are recognizing that poc testing is a cost effective means for improving the quality of care and patient satisfaction 
continuous improvements in technologies are resulting in a growing number of new diagnostic tests that combine high levels of accuracy with rapid  easy to use product formats 
it is our mission to further establish our significant leadership position in poc rapid diagnostics 
in order to accomplish this mission  our strategy is to provide clinicians with validated  evidence based studies which encompass the clinical efficacy and economic efficiency of our rapid poc tests for the professional market 
in conjunction with our qvb commitment  we expect to present ongoing information that supports the adoption of rapid poc testing  continue to focus on strengthening our market and brand leadership in infectious diseases and reproductive and women s health by acquiring  developing and introducing clinically superior diagnostic solutions  drive growth by securing dedicated distributor partnerships and strengthening our sales organization to assure physician and laboratorian satisfaction through direct relationships with integrated delivery networks and hospitals  support payer evaluation of rapid tests and establishment of favorable reimbursement rates  continue creation of strong global alliances to assure leadership in key markets  drive profit through further refinement of our manufacturing efficiencies and productivity improvements  with continued focus on profitable products and markets and our effort to create exceptional competency in new product development  continue to focus our research and development efforts on three areas new proprietary product platform development  the creation of improved products and new products for existing markets and unmet clinical needs  and products developed under collaborations with other companies for new and existing markets  and identify and commercialize new markers  products and collaborations in bone health through the spg 
as a business in a highly regulated and competitive industry  we face many risks and challenges and we also have opportunities 
there are many economic and industry factors that affect our business  some of the more important factors are outlined below sales of our infectious disease products  which have collectively accounted for approximately  and of total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively  are subject to and significantly affected by the seasonal demands of the cold and flu seasons  sales of our products can be affected significantly by many competitive factors  including convenience  price and product performance as well as the distribution  advertising  promotion and brand name recognition of the marketer  intellectual property protection of our products is crucial to our business  the testing  manufacture and commercialization of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities  principally the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies  the production processes for poc tests are complex  highly regulated and vary widely from product to product  to successfully compete for business in our industry  we believe our poc testing solutions must be designed to provide specific results for clinical and economic validation  and there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets over the last several years 
in january  we announced that caren l 
mason  our president and chief executive officer  has decided to retire from the company on june  ms 
mason will continue in her current capacity as president and ceo as well as a board director until march   and from march  through her retirement date  ms 
mason will serve as a special advisor to the ceo 
in january  we also announced the appointment of douglas c 
bryant as the company s new president  ceo and member of the board of directors 
mr 
bryant began his employment in february and his role as president and ceo is effective march  outlook for fiscal year  we anticipate year over year revenue growth 
we expect gross margins will be positively affected by a more favorable product mix  partially offset by lower average selling prices 
we continue to expect a gradual conversion of the fecal occult blood test market from the current guaiac based test to an immunochemical based test 
successful conversion of this market requires changing physician behavior through education  focused in part on clinical and economic validation 
additionally  we expect continued growth from our quickvue rsv test for the qualitative detection of respiratory syncytial virus rsv this season so that physicians are well prepared to diagnose and appropriately manage patients with influenza and or rsv 
we received clinical laboratory improvement amendments of clia waiver on our rsv test in february internationally  we expect continued growth as we increase the reach of our products to markets around the world 
we expect an overall increase in operating expenses for fiscal  including additional investments in research and development 
you should also refer to the discussion in item a  risk factors in part i of this annual report for further discussion of risks related to our business 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and total revenues the following table compares total revenues for the years ended december  and in thousands  except percentages for the year ended december  increase decrease infectious disease net product sales reproductive and women s health net product sales other net product sales royalty income and license fees total revenues the increase in total revenues was primarily driven by increased sales of our infectious disease products  partially offset by a decrease in our reproductive and women s health and other product categories 
we believe the increase in total revenue of our infectious disease products  for both our domestic and international markets  was largely driven by increased market penetration and increased utilization of our influenza test  while the decrease associated with our reproductive and women s health products was primarily driven by the timing of ordering patterns in the domestic market 
purchases by end users of our non seasonal products remained fairly constant for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the previous twelve months 
sales of our infectious disease and reproductive and women s health products accounted for and of our total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the revenue from royalty income and license fees for all periods primarily relate to royalty payments earned on our patented technologies utilized by third parties 
cost of sales cost of sales increased to million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  the absolute dollar increase is primarily related to the variable nature of direct costs material and labor associated with the increase in total revenues 
the percentage decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue was primarily due to a more favorable product mix  partially offset by lower average selling prices 
operating expenses the following table compares operating expenses for the years ended december  and in thousands  except percentages for the year ended december  increase decrease operating expenses as a of total revenues operating expenses as a of total revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets research and development expense the decrease in research and development expense was due primarily to the discontinuation of our layered thin film immunoassay program in the fourth quarter of and a decrease in overall incentive based compensation for  partially offset by increased investment in other strategic research and development efforts 
the primary components of research and development expense are personnel and material costs associated with development of potential new technologies and processes and with products under development 
in addition  we continue to incur substantial costs related to clinical trials as well as our overall efforts under our qvb programs 
sales and marketing expense the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily related to an overall increase in sales personnel and related programs and expenses as well increased expenses associated with distribution events and trade shows  which support our leadership position and strategies to capitalize further on opportunities in poc diagnostics 
this was partially offset by a decrease in overall incentive based compensation for other key components of this expense relate to continued investment in assessing future product extensions and enhancements  market research including voice of customer surveys  reimbursement related activities and product shipment costs 
general and administrative expense the decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to a decrease in overall incentive based compensation for  partially offset by increased headcount added during late amortization of intangible assets the amortization of intangible assets decreased primarily due to the full amortization of certain purchased technology in fiscal year in december  amortization of million associated with a license agreement became fully amortized 
unless the company acquires new intangible assets  amortization of intangibles will decrease in other income expense the slight decrease in interest income to million as of december  from million as of december  was primarily related to the decrease in interest rates  partially offset by an increase in our average cash balance for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  interest expense was relatively constant at million for both of the years ended december  and and relates to interest paid on obligations under capital leases  primarily associated with our san diego facility 
income taxes we recognized income tax expense of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   which was largely driven by the increase in taxable income from to income tax expense for includes a net reduction primarily related to deduction associated with investments in foreign subsidiaries and a manufacturing tax deduction 
income tax expense for includes a reduction of million for the completion of a research and development tax credit study for prior years 
comparison of years ended december  and total revenues the following table compares total revenues for the years ended december  and in thousands  except percentages for the year ended december  increase decrease infectious disease net product sales reproductive and women s health net product sales other net product sales royalty income and license fees total revenues the increase was largely driven by an increase in sales of our infectious disease and reproductive and women s health products of million and million  respectively 
the overall increase was partially offset by an expected decrease of our influenza product revenues in our japanese market 
we believe the increase in total revenue from these product groups was due to successes related to our qvb programs  which have resulted in strengthened customer relationships and preferred partnership programs 
we believe that sales of our influenza products continue to increase as a result of increased market awareness  greater utilization and the demonstrated quality of our test 
we believe our average selling price in the us has continued to increase largely as a result of our clinical proof claims and product quality  while we have experienced downward pressure in the japanese market as a result of reimbursement changes and increased competition 
sales of our infectious disease and reproductive and women s health products accounted for and of our total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the revenue from royalty income and license fees for all periods primarily relate to royalty payments earned on patented technologies of ours utilized by third parties 
cost of sales cost of sales increased to million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  the absolute dollar increase was primarily related to the increase in direct costs material and labor associated with the increase in total revenues 
the percentage decrease in cost of sales to revenue was primarily due to a more favorable product and geographic mix and the leveraging of fixed costs associated with higher unit volume and increased average selling prices 
operating expenses the following table compares operating expenses for the years ended december  and in thousands  except percentages for the year ended december  increase decrease operating expenses as a of total revenues operating expenses as a of total revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets research and development expense our research and development expenses were relatively constant 
while we may experience some fluctuation in our research and development activities associated with the timing of certain projects  the primary components of research and development expense are personnel and material costs associated with development of potential new technologies and processes and with products under development 
in addition  we continue to incur costs related to intellectual property  clinical activity as well as our overall efforts under our qvb programs 
sales and marketing expense the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily related to an overall increase in sales personnel and related programs and expenses  which support our leadership position and strategies to capitalize further on opportunities in poc diagnostics 
other key components of this expense relate to continued investment in assessing future product extensions and enhancements  market research including voice of customer surveys  programs aimed at distribution partners and end user customers and reimbursement related activities and product shipment costs 
general and administrative expense the increase in general and administrative expenses was primary driven by increased stock compensation expense and costs associated with the departure of our former chief financial officer and hiring a new chief financial officer 
amortization of intangible assets the increase in the amortization of intangible assets was primarily due to a license agreement entered into during late and an additional license agreement entered into during other income expense interest income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income was largely related to the increase in our average cash balance as well as more favorable interest rates for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
interest expense was relatively constant at million for both of the years ended december  and interest expense relates to interest paid on obligations under capital leases  primarily associated with our san diego facility 
income taxes we recognized income tax expense of million for the year ended december  versus a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  income tax expense for includes a reduction of million for the completion of a research and development tax credit study for prior years 
for  we recorded a tax benefit which was primarily related to a decrease in the deferred tax valuation allowance during the fourth quarter ended december  and recognizes the deferred tax asset amount considered by management  more likely than not  to be realized 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents  as well as million available to us under our senior secured syndicated credit facility the senior credit facility 
our working capital as of december  was million 
cash provided by our operating activities was million for the year ended december  we had net income of million  including non cash charges of million of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets and property and equipment 
other changes in operating assets and liabilities included increases in accounts receivable and inventory of million and million  respectively  and is due to the timing of sales during the fourth quarter of  and a decrease of million and million for accounts payable and accrued payroll and related expenses  respectively 
the decrease in accounts payable was largely due to seasonal demand fluctuations of our influenza product and amounts included in accounts payable for capital expenditures at the end of fiscal  while the decrease in payroll and related expenses was largely related to payments made during under our employee compensation programs as well as a reduction of incentive based compensation in the increase in other accrued liabilities of million was primarily due to an increase in the allowance for volume discounts related to the increase in total revenues 
our investing activities used million during the year ended december   which was primarily for the acquisition of production and scientific equipment and building improvements 
we had investments in property  plant and equipment of million which had not been paid as of december  we are currently planning approximately million in capital expenditures over the next months 
the primary purpose for our capital expenditures is to acquire manufacturing equipment  implement facility improvements  and for information technology 
we plan to fund these capital expenditures with cash flow from operations 
we do not have any material firm purchase commitments with respect to such planned capital expenditures as of the date of filing this report 
our financing activities used million of cash during the year ended december  which was primarily related to the repurchase of approximately million shares of our common stock in the open market at a cost of million  partially offset by the benefit of million from excess taxes from shared based compensation  and proceeds of million received from the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive and our employee stock purchase plans 
on october   we entered into our new million senior credit facility  which matures on october  the new credit facility replaced the company s million credit facility 
the senior credit facility bears interest at a rate ranging from to plus the lender s prime rate or  at the company s option  a rate ranging from to plus the london interbank offering rate

we are also subject to financial covenants which include a funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio  and an interest coverage ratio 
the senior credit facility is secured by substantially all present and future assets and properties of the company 
as of december   we had no amounts outstanding and million of availability under the senior credit facility and we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we also intend to continue evaluation of acquisition and technology licensing candidates 
as such  we may need to incur additional debt  or issue additional equity  to successfully complete these transactions 
cash requirements fluctuate as a result of numerous factors  such as the extent to which we generate cash from operations  progress in research and development projects  competition and technological developments and the time and expenditures required to obtain governmental approval of our products 
based on our current cash position and the current assessment of future operating results  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet operating needs during the next months and the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
contractual obligations our facilities and certain equipment are leased under noncancelable capital and operating leases 
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations in thousands payment due by period total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total reflects obligations on facilities and equipment under capital leases  including current maturities  in place as of december  future minimum lease payments are included in the table above 
reflects obligations on facilities and equipment under operating leases in place as of december  in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a new operating lease at our santa clara location  including extending the term of the lease through future minimum lease payments are included in the table above 
we have entered into various licensing agreements  which require royalty payments based on specified product sales 
these agreements  which have anticipated expiration dates through  encompass the majority of our products 
royalty expenses under these licensing agreements  which are charged to cost of sales  collectively totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we believe we will continue to incur substantial royalty expenses relating to future sales of our products 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we record revenues primarily from product sales 
these revenues are recorded net of rebates and other discounts which are estimated at the time of sale 
the rebates and other discounts are largely driven by various customer program offerings  including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
revenue from product sales is recorded upon passage of title and risk of loss to the customer 
change in title to the product and recognition of revenue occur upon delivery to the customer when sales terms are free on board fob destination and at the time of shipment when the sales terms are fob shipping point and there is no right of return 
we also earn income from the licensing of technology 
royalty income from the grant of license rights is recognized during the period in which the revenue is earned and the amount is determinable from the licensee 
income earned from licensing activities is a component of total revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes a compensation expense for all share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation expense for all share based awards granted on or after january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
the computation of the expected option life is based on a weighted average calculation combining the average life of options that have already been exercised and post vest cancellations with the estimated life of the remaining vested and unexercised options 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
the volatility of our stock has decreased in recent fiscal periods  and as a result we changed our look back period in determining volatility to the third quarter of this change did not have a material impact on our financial statements for fiscal year the risk free interest rate is based on the u 
s treasury yield curve over the expected term of the option 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock  and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
the estimated forfeiture rate is based on our historical experience and future expectations 
compensation expense related to stock options granted is recognized ratably over the service vesting period for the entire option award 
the total number of stock options expected to vest is adjusted by estimated forfeiture rates 
the estimated fair value of each stock option was determined on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards stock awards is measured at the grant date and recognized ratably over the vesting period 
the fair value of stock awards is determined based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date 
for stock awards granted prior to december   vesting is service based with performance goals that allow for acceleration of a portion of the stock awards 
a majority of the stock awards granted in and were performance based and vesting was tied to achievement of predetermined revenue and or ebitda goals 
for purposes of measuring compensation expense  the amount of shares ultimately expected to vest is estimated at each reporting date based on management s expectations regarding the relevant performance criteria 
the recognition of compensation expense associated with performance based grants requires judgment in assessing the probability of meeting the performance goals  as well as defined criteria for assessing achievement of the performance related goals 
this may result in significant expense recognition or reversal in the period in which the performance goals are met or when achievement of the goals is deemed probable or may result in the reversal of previously recognized stock based compensation expense if the performance criteria are deemed not probable of being met 
the grant date of the performance based stock grants takes place when the grant is authorized and the specific achievement goals are communicated 
the communication date of the performance goals can impact the valuation and associated expense of the stock awards 
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable  our history of bad debts  and the general condition of the industry 
if a major customer s credit worthiness deteriorates  or our customers actual defaults exceed our historical experience  our estimates could change and adversely impact our reported results 
inventory our policy is to value inventories at the lower of cost or market on a part by part basis 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventories  including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventories 
we determine excess and obsolete inventories based on an estimate of the future demand for our products within a specified time horizon  generally months 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
if our demand forecast is greater than our actual demand  we may be required to take additional excess inventory charges  which would decrease gross margin and adversely impact net operating results in the future 
intangible assets intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on the expected number of years the asset will generate revenue or otherwise be used by us 
sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
examples of such events or circumstances include the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  any volatility or significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization compared to our net book value  loss of legal ownership or title to an asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of our assets  and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
for goodwill  a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill 
sfas no 
requires periodic evaluations for impairment of goodwill balances 
we completed our annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill as of december  and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  current tax assets and liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is considered more likely than not to be realized through the generation of future taxable income and other tax planning opportunities 
to the extent that a determination is made to establish or adjust a valuation allowance  the expense or benefit is recorded in the period in which the determination is made 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin provides guidance for the recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in accordance with fin  we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of million  increasing the january  balance of retained earnings 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more information on income taxes 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  we recognize excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
accordingly  deferred tax assets are not recognized for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from excess tax benefits 
as of december  and  deferred tax assets do not include million and million  respectively  of these excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises that are a component of our net operating loss carryforwards 
additional paid in capital will be increased up to million if such excess tax benefits are realized 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised statement no 
 business combinations fas r  which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination i recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  ii recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and iii determines what information to disclose to enable readers of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
fas r will be effective for any business combination that occurs beginning in fiscal year in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp 
fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
the objective of fsp is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under fas r and other us generally accepted accounting principles 
fsp will be effective beginning in fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact that this pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the fair market value of our floating interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of floating interest rate debt will vary as interest rates increase or decrease 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  based on our market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at december  and  we have determined that there was no material market risk exposure to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of such dates 
our current investment policy with respect to our cash and cash equivalents focuses on maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk and liquidity 
although we continually evaluate our placement of investments  as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were placed in money market or overnight funds that are highly liquid and which we believe are not subject to material market fluctuation risk 
foreign currency exchange risk all of our international sales are negotiated for and paid in us dollars 
nonetheless  these sales are subject to currency risks  since changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive 
these exchange rate fluctuations could negatively impact international sales of our products and our anticipated foreign operations  as could changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
continued change in the values of the euro  the japanese yen and other foreign currencies could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not currently hedge against exchange rate fluctuations  which means that we are fully exposed to exchange rate changes
