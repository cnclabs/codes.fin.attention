for more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information  you should read the notes to the financial statements included in this report 
overview crosstex energy  inc is a delaware corporation formed on april  to engage in the gathering  transmission  treating  processing and marketing of natural gas and ngls through its subsidiaries 
on july   we formed crosstex energy  lp  a delaware limited partnership  to acquire indirectly substantially all of the assets  liabilities and operations of its predecessor  crosstex energy services  ltd 
our assets consist almost exclusively of partnership interests in crosstex energy  lp  a publicly traded limited partnership engaged in the gathering  transmission  treating  processing and marketing of natural gas and ngls 
these partnership interests consist of i  common units  representing approximately of the limited partner interests in crosstex energy  lp  and ii ownership interest in crosstex energy gp  lp  the general partner of crosstex energy  lp  which owns a general partner interest and all of the incentive distribution rights in crosstex energy  lp our cash flows consist almost exclusively of distributions from the partnership on the partnership interests we own 
the partnership is required by its partnership agreement to distribute all its cash on hand at the end of each quarter  less reserves established by its general partner in its sole discretion to provide for the proper conduct of the partnership s business or to provide for future distributions 
the incentive distribution rights entitle us to receive an increasing percentage of cash distributed by the partnership as certain target distribution levels are reached 
specifically  they entitle us to receive of all cash distributed in a quarter after each unit has received for that quarter  of all cash distributed after each unit has received for that quarter  and of all cash distributed after each unit has received for that quarter 

table of contents quarterly distributions by the partnership had steadily increased from the first distribution of per unit for the quarter ended march  to per unit for the quarter ended june  the distribution for third quarter of operating results was reduced to per unit followed by a further reduction to per unit for the fourth quarter of paid in february 
the partnership s distributions were reduced during the last half of as a result of a decline in its cash flows from operations due to declines in natural gas and ngl prices during the last half of  gross margin losses due to hurricanes ike and gustav and the declines in the global financial markets and economic conditions as discussed under item business crosstex energy  lp recent developments and business strategy 
our distributions from the partnership pursuant to our ownership of common units and general partner interest  including our incentive distribution rights idrs  during were as follows quarter ended march  paid in may million including million with respect to our idrs quarter ended june  paid in august million including million with respect to our idrs quarter ended september  paid in november million including million with respect to our idrs  and quarter ended december  paid in february million no idr distributions 
in response to the recent developments  the partnership has adjusted its business strategy for to focus on maximizing liquidity  maintaining a stable asset base  improving the profitability of its assets by increasing their utilization while controlling costs and reducing capital expenditures as discussed under crosstex energy  lp business strategies 
one of the strategies included amending the partnership s bank credit facility and its senior note agreement to negotiate terms with its creditors that will allow continued operation of its assets during the current difficult economic conditions 
the amended terms of the credit facility and senior secured note agreement prohibit the partnership from making distributions unless its leverage ratio is below certain levels and the pik notes have been repaid 
the partnership does not expect that it will meet these conditions in since our cash flows consist almost exclusively of distributions from the partnership on the partnership interests we own  we do not expect to receive any significant cash flows until the partnership is able to improve its leverage ratio and begin making distributions again 
as of december   we have million of cash which we expect to be sufficient to pay our expenses and federal income taxes over the next several years based on our forecasted cash flows 
we do not anticipate making any future dividend payments after the dividend payment in february with respect to fourth quarter operating results until we begin receiving distributions from the partnership again 
since we control the general partner interest in the partnership  we reflect our ownership interest in the partnership on a consolidated basis  which means that our financial results are combined with the partnership s financial results and the results of our other subsidiaries 
the interest owned by non controlling partners share of income is reflected as an expense in our results of operations 
we have no separate operating activities apart from those conducted by the partnership  and our cash flows consist almost exclusively of distributions from the partnership on the partnership interests we own 
our consolidated results of operations are derived from the results of operations of the partnership and also include our gains on the issuance of units in the partnership  deferred taxes  interest of non controlling partners in the partnership s net income  interest income expense and general and administrative expenses not reflected in the partnership s results of operation 
accordingly  the discussion of our financial position and results of operations in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations primarily reflects the operating activities and results of operations of the partnership 
the partnership has two industry segments  midstream and treating  with a geographic focus along the texas gulf coast  in the north texas barnett shale area  and in louisiana and mississippi 
the partnership s midstream division focuses on the gathering  processing  transmission and marketing of natural gas and ngls  as well as providing certain producer services  while the treating division focuses on the removal of contaminants from natural gas and ngls to meet pipeline quality specifications 
for the year ended december   approximately of the partnership s gross margin was generated in the midstream division  with the balance in the treating division 
the partnership focuses on gross margin to manage its operations because its business is generally to 
table of contents purchase and resell natural gas for a margin  or to gather  process  transport  market or treat natural gas or ngls for a fee 
the partnership buys and sells most of its natural gas at a fixed relationship to the relevant index price so margins on gas sales 
in addition  the partnership receives certain fees for processing based on a percentage of the liquids produced and enters into hedge contracts for its expected share of the liquids produced to protect margins from changes in liquids prices 
during the past five years  the partnership has grown significantly as a result of construction and acquisition of gathering and transmission pipelines and treating and processing plants 
from january  through december   it has invested over billion to develop or acquire new assets 
the purchased assets were acquired from numerous sellers at different periods and were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations for such acquisitions are included in our financial statements only from the applicable date of the acquisition 
as a consequence  the historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable 
the partnership s midstream segment margins are determined primarily by the volumes of natural gas gathered  transported  purchased and sold through its pipeline systems  processed at its processing facilities and the volumes of ngls handled at its fractionation facilities 
treating segment margins are largely a function of the number and size of treating plants in operation 
the partnership generates midstream revenues from six primary sources purchasing and reselling or transporting natural gas on the pipeline systems it owns  processing natural gas at its processing plants and fractionating and marketing the recovered ngls  treating natural gas at its treating plants  providing compression services  and providing off system marketing services for producers 
with respect to the partnership s midstream services  it generally gathers or transports gas owned by others through its facilities for a fee  or it buys natural gas from a producer  plant or shipper at either a fixed discount to a market index or a percentage of the market index  then transport and resell the natural gas 
in the partnership s purchase sale transactions  the resale price is generally based on the same index price at which the gas was purchased  and  if the partnership is to be profitable  at a smaller discount or larger premium to the index than it was purchased 
the partnership attempts to execute all purchases and sales substantially concurrently  or it enters into a future delivery obligation  thereby establishing the basis for the margin it will receive for each natural gas transaction 
the partnership s gathering and transportation margins related to a percentage of the index price can be adversely affected by declines in the price of natural gas 
the partnership also realizes margins in its midstream segment from processing services primarily through three different contract arrangements processing margins margin  percentage of liquids pol or fee based 
under the margin and pol contract arrangements the partnerships margins are higher during periods of high liquid prices relative to natural gas prices 
under fee based contracts its margins are driven by throughput volume 
see commodity price risk 
the partnership generates treating revenues under three types of arrangements a volumetric fee based on the amount of gas treated  which accounted for approximately of operating income in the treating division for the years ended december  and  a fixed fee for operating a plant for a certain period  which accounted for approximately and of operating income in the treating division for the years ended december  and  respectively  and a fee arrangement in which the producer operates the plant  which accounted for approximately and of operating income in the treating division for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents operating expenses are costs directly associated with the operations of a particular asset 
among the most significant of these costs are those associated with direct labor and supervision and associated transportation and communication costs  property insurance  ad valorem taxes  repair and maintenance expenses  measurement and utilities 
these costs are normally fairly stable across broad volume ranges  and therefore  do not normally decrease or increase significantly in the short term with decreases or increases in the volume of gas moved through the asset 
recent developments global financial markets and economic conditions have been  and continue to be  disrupted and volatile 
numerous events during have severely restricted current liquidity in the capital markets throughout the united states and around the world 
the ability to raise money in the debt and equity markets has diminished significantly and  if available  the cost of funds has increased substantially 
one of the features driving investments in mlps  such as our investment in celp  over the past few years has been the distribution growth offered by mlps due to liquidity in the financial markets for capital investments to grow distributable cash flow through development projects and acquisitions 
future growth opportunities have been and are expected to continue to be constrained by the lack of liquidity in the financial markets 
in addition  the partnership s business has been significantly impacted by the substantial decline in crude oil prices during the last half of from a high of approximately per bbl in july to a low of approximately per bbl in december based on nymex futures daily close prices for the prompt month  a decline  and the related decline in ngl prices from a high of per gallon in july to a low of in december based on the opis mt 
belvieu daily average spot liquids prices 
crude oil prices reflected on nymex during january and february have fluctuated  to a lesser extent  between per bbl and per bbl while the opis mt 
belvieu ngl prices have improved slightly ranging from per gallon and per gallon 
the declines in ngl prices have negatively impacted the partnership s gross margin for the fourth quarter of and could continue to negatively impact our gross margin revenue less cost of gas purchases in a significant percentage of inlet gas at its processing plants is settled under percent of liquids pol agreements or fractionation margin margin contracts 
over the past two years the inlet processing volumes associated with pol and margin contracts were approximately  on a combined basis  of the total volume of gas processed 
the pol fees are denominated in the form of a share of the liquids extracted 
therefore  fee revenue under a pol agreement is directly impacted by ngl prices and the decline of these prices in contributed to a significant decline in gross margin from processing 
under the pol settlement terms  the partnership is not responsible for the fuel or shrink associated with processing 
under margin contracts the partnership realizes a gross margin from processing based upon the difference in the value of ngls extracted from the gas less the value of the product in its gaseous state and the cost of fuel to extract 
this is often referred to as the fractionation spread 
during the last half of the fractionation spread narrowed significantly as the value of ngls decreased more than the value of the gas and fuel associated with the processed gas 
thus the gross margin realized under these margin contracts was also negatively impacted due to the commodity price environment 
if the current weakness in the economy continues for a prolonged period  it would likely further reduce demand for gas and for ngl products  such as ethane  a primary feedstock for the petrochemical and manufacturing industries  and result in continued lower natural gas and ngl prices 
although the partnership has seen some improvement in ngl prices and the fractionation spread in the early months of over the levels experienced in december  the partnership believes that its processing margins in will be substantially lower than the processing margins realized in based on current market indicators 
for the year ended december   approximately of the partnership s gross margin was attributable to gas processing as compared to of its gross margin for the year ended december  see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk for a description of the contractual processing arrangements used by the partnership 
natural gas prices have declined by approximately  from a high of per mmbtu in july to a low of per mmbtu in december based on the nymex futures daily close prices for the prompt month 
natural gas prices have declined even further during january and february with prices ranging from in early january to in mid february 
many of the partnership s customers finance their drilling activity with cash flow from operations  which have been negatively impacted by the declines in natural gas and crude oil prices  or through the incurrence of debt or issuance of equity  which markets have been adversely impacted by global 
table of contents financial market conditions 
the partnership believes that the adverse price changes coupled with the overall downturn in the economy and the constrained capital markets will put downward pressure on drilling budgets for gas producers which could result in lower volumes being transported on its pipeline and gathering systems and processing through its processing plants 
the partnership has seen a decline in drilling activity by gas producers in its areas of operation during the fourth quarter of in addition  industry drilling rig count surveys published in early show substantial declines in rigs in operation as compared to several of the partnership s customers  including one of its largest customers in the barnett shale  have recently announced drilling plans for that are substantially below their drilling levels during the partnership s business was also negatively impacted by hurricanes gustav and ike  which came ashore in the gulf coast in september although the majority of its assets in texas and louisiana sustained minimal physical damage from these hurricanes and promptly resumed operations  several offshore production platforms and pipelines that transport gas production to its pelican  eunice  sabine pass and blue water processing plants in south louisiana were damaged by the storms 
some of the repairs to these offshore facilities were completed during the fourth quarter of but the partnership does not anticipate that gas production to its south louisiana plants will recover to pre hurricane levels until mid  when all repairs are expected to be complete 
additionally  one of the partnership s south louisiana processing plants  the sabine pass processing plant  which is located on the shoreline of the louisiana gulf coast  sustained some physical damage 
the sabine pass processing plant was repaired during the fourth quarter of and the plant was returned to service in early january operations in north texas were also impacted by these hurricanes because operations at mt 
belvieu  texas a central distribution point for ngl sales  where several fractionators are located which fractionate ngls from the entire united states were interrupted as a result of these storms 
these storms resulted in an adverse impact to the partnership s gross margin of approximately million 
two of the partnership s facilities  one in south louisiana and one in north texas  were also partially damaged by fires during although substantially all of the property repairs were covered by insurance  the sabine pass processing plant in south louisiana was out of service for approximately one month 
the loss of operating income due to the fire at the godley compressor station in north texas was minimal because the partnership was successful in rerouting the gas to our other facilities in the area until the damaged compressor was replaced 
the estimated loss in gross margin as a result of these fires is million 
acquisitions and expansion the partnership has grown significantly through asset purchases and construction and expansion projects in recent years 
this growth creates many of the major differences when comparing operating results from one period to another 
the most significant asset purchases since january were the acquisition of midstream assets from chief in june  the hanover compression company treating assets in february and the amine treating business of cardinal gas solutions lp in october in addition  internal expansion projects in north texas and louisiana have contributed to the increase in the partnership s business during  and on june   the partnership expanded its operations in the north texas area through the acquisition of the natural gas gathering pipeline systems and related facilities of chief in the barnett shale for million 
the acquired systems included gathering pipeline  a mmcf d carbon dioxide treating plant and compression facilities with  horsepower 
at the closing of that acquisition  approximately  net acres previously owned by chief and acquired by devon  simultaneously with the partnership s acquisition  as well as  net acres owned by other producers  were dedicated to the systems 
immediately following the closing of the chief acquisition  the partnership began expanding its north texas pipeline gathering system 
the continued expansion of the north texas gathering systems to handle the growing production in the barnett shale was one of the partnership s core areas for internal growth during  and and will continue to be a core area during since the date of the acquisition through december   the partnership has connected new wells to its gathering system and significantly increased the dedicated acreage owned by other producers 
the partnership s processing capacity in the barnett shale is mmcf d including the silver creek plant  which is a mmcf d cryogenic processing plant  the azle plant  which is a mmcf d cryogenic processing plant  and the goforth plant  which is a mmcf d processing plant 
in and  the partnership constructed a mile expansion in north johnson county to its north texas gathering systems 
the first phase of the expansion 
table of contents commenced operation in september the last two phases of the expansion commenced operation in may and july of the total gathering capacity of this mile expansion is currently mmcf d and is expected to be increased to approximately mmcf d in april by the addition of compression 
the partnership has also installed two gallon per minute and one gallon per minute amine treating plants to provide carbon dioxide removal capability 
as of december  the capacity of the north texas gathering system was approximately  mmcf d and total throughput on the north texas gathering systems  including the north johnson county expansion  had increased from approximately  mmbtu d at the time of the chief acquisition to approximately  mmbtu d 
in april  the partnership commenced construction of an million natural gas processing facility called bear creek in hood county near its existing north texas assets 
the new plant will have a gas processing capacity of mmcf d 
due to the recent decline in commodity prices and the corresponding decline in drilling activity  the partnership does not anticipate that the additional processing capacity provided by the bear creek plant will be needed until late or in therefore  it has decided to put this construction project on hold until the demand for this processing capacity returns  at which time it will seek to obtain financing for the project 
as of december   the partnership has spent approximately million on this project for the construction of a portion of the plant that will be utilized when the plant is completed in the future 
on february   the partnership acquired amine treating plants from a subsidiary of hanover compression company for million 
on october   the partnership acquired the amine treating business of cardinal gas solutions lp for million 
the acquisition added dew point control plants and of seven amine treating plants to our plant portfolio 
on march   it acquired the remaining interest in the amine treating plants for approximately million 
the partnership s ntp  which commenced service in april  consists of a mile pipeline and associated gathering lines from an area near fort worth  texas to a point near paris  texas 
the initial capacity of the ntp was approximately mmcf d 
in  the partnership expanded the capacity on the ntp to a total of approximately mmcf d 
the ntp connects production from the barnett shale to markets in north texas and to markets accessed by ngpl  kinder morgan  hpl  atmos and other markets 
as of december  the total throughput on the ntp was approximately  mmbtu d 
the ntp also will interconnect with a new interstate gas pipeline under construction by boardwalk pipeline partners  lp known as the gulf crossing pipeline which is expected to be in service in march the gulf crossing pipeline is expected to provide the partnership s customer s access to premium mid west and east coast markets 
in april  the partnership completed construction and commenced operations on its north louisiana expansion  which is an extension of the lig system designed to increase take away pipeline capacity to the producers developing natural gas in the fields south of shreveport  louisiana 
the north louisiana expansion consists of approximately miles of mainline with miles of gathering lateral pipeline and  horsepower of new compression referred to as the red river lateral 
the red river lateral bisects the developing haynesville shale gas play in north louisiana 
the red river lateral was operating at near capacity during so the partnership added mmcf d of capacity by adding compression during the third quarter of bringing the total capacity of the red river lateral to approximately mmcf d 
as of december   the red river lateral was flowing at approximately  mmbtu d 
interconnects on the north louisiana expansion include connections with the interstate pipelines of anr pipeline  columbia gulf transmission  texas gas transmission and trunkline gas 
other assets we owned two inactive gas plants in addition to our limited and general partner interests in the partnership 
these two gas plants are the jonesville processing plant and the clarkson plant 
during these two plants were transferred to the partnership at net book value for a cash price of million which represented the fair value of the plants 

table of contents impact of federal income taxes crosstex energy  inc is a corporation for federal income tax purposes 
as such  our federal taxable income is subject to tax at a maximum rate of under current law 
we expect to have taxable income allocated to us as a result of our investment in the partnership s units  particularly because of remedial allocations that will be made among the unitholders 
taxable income allocated to us by the partnership will increase over the years as the results of operation increase and as the ratio of income to distributions increases for all of the unitholders 
as of december  we have a net operating loss carry forward of million for federal income taxes and state loss carry forwards of million 
we believe it is more likely than not that our future results of operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize these net operating loss carry forwards before they expire 
once these net operating loss carry forwards are fully utilized  we will have to pay tax on our federal taxable income at a maximum rate of under current law 
our use of this net operating loss carry forward will be limited if there is a greater than change in our stock ownership over a three year period 
commodity price risk the partnership s business is subject to significant risks due to fluctuations in commodity prices 
its exposure to these risks is primarily in the gas processing component of its business 
a large percentage of the processing fees are realized under pol contracts that are directly impacted by the market price of ngls 
it also realizes processing gross margins under margin contracts 
these settlements are impacted by the relationship between ngl prices and the underlying natural gas prices  which is also referred to as the fractionation spread 
a significant volume of inlet gas at the partnership s south louisiana and north texas processing plants is settled under pol agreements 
the pol fees are denominated in the form of a share of the liquids extracted and the partnership is not responsible for the fuel or shrink associated with processing 
therefore  fee revenue under a pol agreement is directly impacted by ngl prices  and the decline of these prices in contributed to a significant decline in gross margin from processing 
the partnership has a number of fractionation margin contracts on its plaquemine and gibson processing plants that expose it to the fractionation spread 
under these margin contracts its gross margin is based upon the difference in the value of ngls extracted from the gas less the value of the product in its gaseous state and the cost of fuel to extract during processing 
during the last half of the fractionation spread narrowed significantly as the value of ngls decreased more than the value of the gas and fuel associated with the processed gas 
thus the gross margin realized under these margin contracts was negatively impacted due to the commodity price environment 
the significant decline in crude oil prices and a related decline in ngl prices during the last half of had a significant negative impact on the partnership s margins  and may negatively impact its gross margin further if such declines continue 
the partnership is also subject to price risk to a lesser extent for fluctuations in natural gas prices with respect to a portion of its gathering and transportation services 
approximately of the natural gas it markets is purchased at a percentage of the relevant natural gas index price  as opposed to a fixed discount to that price 
as a result of purchasing the natural gas at a percentage of the index price  resale margins are higher during periods of high natural gas prices and lower during periods of lower natural gas prices

results of operations set forth in the table below is certain financial and operating data for the midstream and treating divisions for the periods indicated 

table of contents years ended december  dollars in millions midstream revenues midstream purchased gas profits on energy trading activities midstream gross margin treating revenues treating purchased gas treating gross margin total gross margin midstream volumes mmbtu d gathering and transportation processing producer services treating plants in operation at year end year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross margin and profit on energy trading activities 
midstream gross margin was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily due to system expansion projects and increased throughput on our gathering and transmission systems 
these increases were partially offset by margin decreases in the processing business due to a less favorable ngl market and operating downtime resulting from the impact of hurricanes in the last half of the year 
profit on energy trading activities decreased for the comparative periods by approximately million 
system expansion in the north texas region and increased throughput on the ntp contributed million of gross margin growth for the year ended december  over the same period in the partnership s gathering systems in the region and ntp accounted for million and million of this increase  respectively 
the partnership s processing facilities in the region contributed an additional million of gross margin increase 
system expansion and volume increases on the lig system contributed margin growth of million during the year ended december  over the same period in processing plants in louisiana experienced a margin decline of million for the comparative twelve month period in due to a less favorable ngl processing environment in the last half of the year and business interruptions resulting from the impact of hurricanes along the gulf coast 
these unfavorable processing conditions also contributed to margin declines in south texas on the vanderbilt system and gregory processing facility of million and million  respectively 
a throughput decline on the gregory gathering system resulted in a gross margin decrease of million 
these declines were partially offset by a gross margin increase on the ccng system of million due to an increase in throughput 
the mississippi system had a margin increase of million due to increased throughput  and an expansion of the east texas system contributed to a margin increase of million for the comparable periods 
the partnership s processing and gathering systems were negatively impacted by events beyond our control during the third quarter that had a significant effect on gross margin results for the year ended december  hurricanes gustav and ike came ashore along the gulf coast in september the partnership estimates that these storms resulted in approximately million gross margin decrease for the year 
the lost margin was primarily experienced at gas processing facilities along the gulf coast 
however  processing facilities further inland in louisiana and north texas were indirectly impacted due to disruption in the ngl markets 
in addition  approximately million in gross margin was lost at the sabine pass plant in august due to downtime from fire damage 
the fire occurred during an attempt to bring the plant back on line following tropical storm edouard 

table of contents treating gross margin was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the partnership had approximately and treating plants  dew point control plants  and related equipment in service at december  and  respectively 
gross margin growth for the period of million is attributable primarily to the increase in the number of plants and an increase in throughput on the volume based plants 
field services provided to producers also contributed gross margin growth of million for the comparable periods 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase is primarily attributable to the following factors million increase in midstream operating expenses resulting primarily from growth and expansion in the ntp  ntg  north louisiana and east texas areas 
contractor services and labor costs increased million  chemicals and materials increased million  equipment rental increased million and ad valorem taxes increased million  million increase in treating operating expenses  including million for materials and supplies  contractor services costs of million to support maintenance projects  labor costs of million as a result of market adjustments for field service employees and additional headcount and auto related expenses of million  and million increase in technical services operating expense 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase is primarily attributable to the following factors million increase in rental expense resulting primarily from additional office rent and including million related to lease termination fees for the cancelled relocation of our corporate headquarters  million increase in bad debt expense due to the semstream  lp bankruptcy  million increase in other expenses  including professional fees and services and labor and benefit expenses  and million decrease in stock based compensation expense resulting primarily from the reduction of estimated performance based restricted units and restricted shares 
gain loss on derivatives 
we had a gain on derivatives of million for the year ended december  compared to a gain of million for the year ended december  the derivative transaction types contributing to the net gain are as follows in millions years ended december  total realized total realized gain loss on derivatives basis swaps processing margin hedges storage third party on system swaps puts other gain loss on sale of property 
assets sold during the year ended december  generated a net gain of million as compared to a gain of million during the year ended december  the gain was 
table of contents primarily generated from the disposition of various small treating and midstream assets 
the gain was primarily generated from the disposition of unused catalyst material and the disposition of a treating plant 
impairments 
during the year ended december   we had an impairment expense of million compared to no impairment expense for the year ended december  the impairment expense is comprised of million related to the blue water gas processing plant located in south louisiana the impairment on our interest in the blue water gas processing plant was recognized because the pipeline company which owns the offshore blue water system and supplies gas to the partnership s blue water plant reversed the flow of the gas on its pipeline in early january thereby removing access to all the gas processed at the blue water plant from the blue water offshore system 
at this time  the partnership has not found an alternative source of new gas for the blue water plant so the plant ceased operation in january an impairment of million was recognized for the carrying amount of the plant in excess of the estimated fair value of the plant as of december  million related to goodwill we determined that the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to the partnership s midstream segment was impaired because of the significant decline in its midstream operations due to negative impacts on cash flows caused by the significant declines in natural gas and ngl prices during the last half of coupled with the global economic decline 
million related to leasehold improvements we had planned to relocate our corporate headquarters during to a larger office facility 
we had leased office space and were close to completing the renovation of this office space when the global economic decline began impacting our operations in october on december   the decision was made to cancel the new office lease and not relocate the corporate offices from our existing office location 
the impairment relates to the leasehold improvements on the office space for the cancelled lease 
million related to the arkoma gathering system the impairment on the arkoma gathering system was recognized because the partnership sold this asset in february for million and the carrying amount of the plant exceeded the sale price by approximately million

table of contents growth of million 
the plaquemine and gibson plants contributed margin growth of million due to a favorable gas processing environment 
the favorable gas processing margin also led to a combined million margin increase on the vanderbilt and gulf coast systems 
the favorable processing margins the partnership realized during at several of its processing facilities may be higher than margins it currently is realizing or may realize during future periods due to the current economic environment and ngl prices 
as discussed above under commodity price risk  the partnership receives as a processing fee a percentage of the liquids recovered as on a substantial portion of the gas processed by these plants 
also  during periods when processing margins are favorable due to liquids prices being high relative to natural gas prices  as existed during  the partnership has the ability to generate higher processing margins 
the partnership has the ability to bypass certain volumes when processing is uneconomical so it can avoid negative processing margins but processing margins will be lower during these periods 
in addition  the partnership has the ability to buy gas from and to sell gas to various gas markets through its pipeline systems 
during  the partnership was able to benefit from price differentials between the various gas markets by selling gas into markets with more favorable pricing thereby improving its midstream gross margin

critical accounting policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
compliance with the rules necessarily involves reducing a number of very subjective judgments to a quantifiable accounting entry or valuation 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules is critical 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on our accounting policies and a discussion of new accounting pronouncements 
revenue recognition and commodity risk management 
the partnership recognizes revenue for sales or services at the time the natural gas or ngls are delivered or at the time the service is performed 
it generally accrues one to two months of sales and the related gas purchases and reverses these accruals when the sales and purchases are actually invoiced and recorded in the subsequent months 
actual results could differ from the accrual estimates 
the partnership utilizes extensive estimation procedures to determine the sales and cost of gas purchase accruals for each accounting cycle 
accruals are based on estimates of volumes flowing each month from a variety of sources 
it uses actual measurement data  if it is available  and will use such data as producer shipper nominations  prior month average daily flows  estimated flow for new production and estimated end user requirements all adjusted for the estimated impact of weather patterns when actual measurement data is not available 
throughout the month or two following production  actual measured sales and transportation volumes are received and invoiced and used in a process referred to as actualization 
through the actualization process  any estimation differences recorded through the accrual are reflected in the subsequent month s accounting cycle when the accrual is reversed and actual amounts are recorded 
actual volumes purchased  processed or sold may differ from the estimates due to a variety of factors including  but not limited to actual wellhead production or customer requirements being higher or lower than the amount nominated at the beginning of the month  liquids recoveries being higher or lower than estimated because gas processed through the plants was richer or leaner than estimated  the estimated impact of weather patterns being different from the actual impact on sales and purchases  and pipeline maintenance or allocation causing actual deliveries of gas to be different than estimated 
the partnership believes 
table of contents that its accrual process for the one to two months of sales and purchases provides a reasonable estimate of such sales and purchases 
the partnership engages in price risk management activities in order to minimize the risk from market fluctuations in the price of natural gas and natural gas liquids 
the partnership manages its price risk related to future physical purchase or sale commitments by entering into either corresponding physical delivery contracts or financial instruments with an objective to balance its future commitments and significantly reduce its risk to the movement in natural gas prices 
the partnership uses derivatives to hedge against changes in cash flows related to product prices and interest rate risk  as opposed to their use for trading purposes 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires that all derivatives and hedging instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities at fair value 
if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting  changes in the fair value can be offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until such time as the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the partnership conducts off system gas marketing operations as a service to producers on systems that it does not own 
the partnership refers to these activities as part of energy trading activities 
in some cases  the partnership earns an agency fee from the producer for arranging the marketing of the producer s natural gas 
in other cases  the partnership purchases the natural gas from the producer and enters into a sales contract with another party to sell the natural gas 
the revenue and cost of sales for these activities are shown net in the statement of operations 
the partnership manages its price risk related to future physical purchase or sale commitments for energy trading activities by entering into either corresponding physical delivery contracts or financial instruments with an objective to balance future commitments and significantly reduce risk related to the movement in natural gas prices 
however  the partnership is subject to counter party risk for both the physical and financial contracts 
the partnership s energy trading contracts qualify as derivatives  and it uses mark to market accounting for both physical and financial contracts of the energy trading business 
accordingly  any gain or loss associated with changes in the fair value of derivatives and physical delivery contracts relating to energy trading activities are recognized in earnings as gain or loss on derivatives immediately 
sales of securities by subsidiaries 
we recognize gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations resulting from subsidiary sales of additional equity interest  including the partnership s limited partnership units  to unrelated parties 
impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the partnership evaluates the long lived assets  including related intangibles  of identifiable business activities for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value for the assets and recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is greater than fair value 
when determining whether impairment of one of the partnership s long lived assets has occurred  it must estimate the undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset 
the estimate of cash flows is based on assumptions regarding the purchase and resale margins on natural gas  volume of gas available to the asset  markets available to the asset  operating expenses  and future natural gas prices and ngl product prices 
the amount of availability of gas to an asset is sometimes based on assumptions regarding future drilling activity  which may be dependent in part on natural gas prices 
projections of gas volumes and future commodity prices are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors  including but not limited to changes in general economic conditions in regions in which our markets are located  the availability and prices of natural gas supply  the partnership s ability to negotiate favorable sales agreements  
table of contents the risks that natural gas exploration and production activities will not occur or be successful  the partnership s dependence on certain significant customers  producers  and transporters of natural gas  and competition from other midstream companies  including major energy producers 
any significant variance in any of the above assumptions or factors could materially affect the partnership s cash flows  which could require us to record an impairment of an asset 
depreciation expense and cost capitalization 
our assets consist primarily of natural gas gathering pipelines  processing plants  transmission pipelines and natural gas treating plants owned by the partnership 
the partnership capitalizes all construction related direct labor and material costs  as well as indirect construction costs 
indirect construction costs include general engineering and the costs of funds used in construction 
capitalized interest represents the cost of funds used to finance the construction of new facilities and is expensed over the life of the constructed assets through the recording of depreciation expense 
the partnership capitalizes the costs of renewals and betterments that extend the useful life  while we expense the costs of repairs  replacements and maintenance projects as incurred 
the partnership generally computes depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets 
certain assets such as land  ngl line pack and natural gas line pack are non depreciable 
the computation of depreciation expense requires judgment regarding the estimated useful lives and salvage value of assets 
as circumstances warrant  depreciation estimates may be reviewed to determine if any changes are needed 
such changes could involve an increase or decrease in estimated useful lives or salvage values  which would impact future depreciation expense

total cash distributions made during the last three years were as follows in millions years ended december  dividends to shareholders non controlling partners total in order to reduce our interest costs  the partnership does not borrow money to fund outstanding checks until they are presented to the bank 
fluctuations in drafts payable are caused by timing of disbursements  cash receipts and draws on our revolving credit facility 
changes in drafts payable for  and were as follows in millions years ended december  increase decrease in drafts payable working capital deficit 
we had a working capital deficit of million as of december   primarily due to drafts payable of million as of the same date 
changes in working capital may fluctuate significantly between periods even though the partnership s trade receivables and payables are typically collected and paid in to day pay cycles 
a large volume of its revenues are collected and a large volume of its gas purchases are paid near each month end or the first few days of the following month so receivable and payable balances at any month end may fluctuate significantly depending on the timing of these receipts and payments 
in addition  although the partnership strives to minimize natural gas and ngls in inventory  these working inventory balances may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to operational reasons and due to changes in natural gas and ngl prices 
working capital also includes mark to market derivative assets and liabilities associated with commodity derivatives which may fluctuate significantly due the changes in natural gas and ngl prices and 
table of contents associated with interest rate swap derivatives which may fluctuate significantly due to changes in interest rates 
the changes in working capital during the years ended december   and are due to the impact of the fluctuations discussed above 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and april sale of common units

march sale of senior subordinated series d units 
on march   the partnership issued an aggregate of  senior subordinated series d units representing limited partner interests in a private offering for net proceeds of approximately million 
the senior subordinated series d units were issued at per unit  which represented a discount of approximately to the market value of common units on such date 
the discount represented an underwriting discount plus the fact that the units would not receive a distribution nor be readily transferable for two years 
we made a general partner contribution of million in connection with this issuance to maintain our general partner interest 
due to the decreased distribution with respect to the fourth quarter of  the senior subordinated series d units will automatically convert into common units on march  at a ratio of common unit for each senior subordinated series d unit 
the senior subordinated series d units are not entitled to distributions of available cash or allocations of net income loss from the partnership until march  june sale of senior subordinated series c units

the senior subordinated series c units automatically converted to common units on february  at a ratio of one common unit for each senior subordinated series c unit 
the senior subordinated series c units were not entitled to distributions of available cash until their conversion to common units 
sources of liquidity in and capital requirements historically the partnership has been successful in accessing capital from both the equity market and financial institutions to fund the growth of its operations 
however  due to the lack of liquidity in the financial and equity markets coupled with the decline in our midstream operations  the partnership s access to capital is expected to be severely limited in as a result the partnership has significantly reduced its growth plans during and to operate within the existing capital structure 
one of the first steps the partnership needed to accomplish to continue to operate within its existing capital structure was to amend the terms of its bank credit facility and senior secured note agreement to allow it to operate with a higher leverage ratio and a lower interest coverage ratio due to the anticipated decline in operating income for and based on current economic conditions 
the partnership amended its bank credit facility and its senior secured note agreement in november and again in february to provide for terms that the partnership expects will allow it to continue to operate its assets during the current difficult economic conditions 
the terms of the amended agreements allow the partnership to maintain a higher level of leverage and to maintain a lower interest coverage ratio but its interest costs will increase  its ability to incur additional indebtedness will be restricted when operating at higher leverage ratios and the partnership s ability to pay distributions will be 
table of contents prohibited until the leverage ratio is significantly lower and it repays the pik notes 
the pik notes are due six months after the earlier of the refinancing or maturity of the bank credit facility 
the terms of these agreements and our pik notes are described more fully under description of indebtedness 
the partnership lowered its distribution level from per unit for the second quarter of to per unit for the third quarter of and per unit for the fourth quarter of as discussed above  the amended terms of its credit facility and senior secured note agreement restrict its ability to make distributions unless certain conditions are met 
the partnership does not expect that it will meet these conditions in the partnership has reduced budgeted capital expenditures significantly for total growth capital investments in the calendar year are currently anticipated to be approximately million and primarily relate to capital projects in north texas and louisiana pursuant to contractual obligations with producers 
the partnership will use cash flow from operations and existing capacity under its bank credit facility to fund its reduced capital spending plan during capital expenditures in future periods will be limited to cash flow from operating activities and to existing capacity under the bank credit facility 
it is unlikely that the partnership will be able to make any acquisitions based on the terms of its credit facility and senior secured note agreement and the condition of the capital markets because it may only use excess proceeds  as defined under amendments to credit documents below  from the incurrence of unsecured debt and the issuance of equity to make such acquisitions 
the partnership has reduced general and administrative expenses by reducing its work force by approximately through the elimination of open positions and elimination of certain corporate positions and minimizing all non essential costs 
it also reduced operating expenses by reducing overtime and renegotiating certain contracts to reduce monthly costs and by eliminating some equipment rentals 
total contractual cash obligations 
a summary of the partnership s total contractual cash obligations as of december  is as follows in millions payments due by period total thereafter long term debt interest payable on fixed long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations fin tax obligations total contractual obligations the above table does not include any physical or financial contract purchase commitments for natural gas 
the partnership s interest payable under its credit facility is not reflected in the above table because such amounts depend on outstanding balances and interest rates  which will vary from time to time 
based on balances outstanding and rates in effect at december   annual interest payments would be million 
the interest amounts also exclude estimates of the effect of our interest rate swap contracts 
the unconditional purchase obligations for relate to purchase commitments for equipment

in september  the partnership increased borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility to billion 
the bank credit facility matures in june as of december   million was outstanding under the bank credit facility  including million of letters of credit  leaving approximately million available for future borrowing 
obligations under the bank credit facility are secured by first priority liens on all of the partnership s material pipeline  gas gathering and processing assets  all material working capital assets and a pledge of all of its equity interests in substantially all of its subsidiaries  and rank pari passu in right of payment with the senior secured notes 
the bank credit facility is guaranteed by the partnership s material subsidiaries 
the partnership may prepay all loans under the credit facility at any time without premium or penalty other than customary libor breakage costs  subject to certain notice requirements 
on november   the partnership entered into the fifth amendment and consent the fifth amendment to its credit facility with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  and the banks and other parties thereto the bank lending group 
the fifth amendment amended the agreement governing the credit facility to  among other things  i increase the maximum permitted leverage ratio the partnership must maintain for the fiscal quarters ending december  through september   ii lower the minimum interest coverage ratio the partnership must maintain for the fiscal quarter ending december  and each fiscal quarter thereafter  iii permit the partnership to sell certain assets  iv increase the interest rate the partnership pays on the obligations under the credit facility and v lowers the maximum permitted leverage ratio the partnership must maintain if it or its subsidiaries incur unsecured note indebtedness 
due to the continued decline in commodity prices and the deterioration in the processing margins  the partnership determined that there was a significant risk that the amended terms negotiated in november would not be sufficient to allow it to operate during without triggering a covenant default under the bank credit facility and the senior secured note agreement 
on february   the partnership entered into the sixth amendment to fourth amended and restated credit agreement and consent the sixth amendment to its credit facility with the bank lending group 
under the sixth amendment  borrowings will bear interest at the partnership s option at the administrative agent s reference rate plus an applicable margin or libor plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margins for the partnership s interest rate and letter of credit fees vary quarterly based on the partnership s leverage ratio as defined by the credit facility the leverage ratio being generally 
table of contents computed as total funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and certain other non cash charges and are as follows beginning february  bank reference letter of rate libor rate credit commitment leverage ratio advances a advances b fees c fees d greater than or equal to to greater than or equal to to and less than to greater than or equal to to and less than to less than to a the applicable margins for the bank reference rate advances ranged from to under the bank credit facility prior to the fifth and sixth amendments 
the applicable margin for the bank reference rate advances was paid at the maximum rate of under the fifth amendment from the november  until february  b the applicable margins for the libor rate advances ranged from to under the bank credit facility prior to the fifth and sixth amendments 
the applicable margin for the bank reference rate advances was paid at the maximum rate of under the fifth amendment from the november  until february  c the letter of credit fees ranged from to per annum plus a fronting fee of per annum under the bank credit facility prior to the fifth and sixth amendments 
the letter of credit fees were paid at the maximum rate of per annum in addition to the fronting fee under the fifth amendment from the november  until february  d the commitment fees ranged from to per annum on the unused amount of the credit facility under the bank credit facility prior to the fifth and sixth amendments 
the commitment fees were paid at the maximum rate of per annum under the fifth amendment from the november  until february  the sixth amendment also sets a floor for the libor interest rate of per annum  which means  effective as of february   borrowings under the bank credit facility accrue interest at the rate of based on the libor rate in effect on such date and the partnership s current leverage ratio 
based on the partnership s forecasted leverage ratios for  it expects the applicable margins to be at the high end of these ranges for interest rate and letter of credit fees 
pursuant to the sixth amendment  the partnership must pay a leverage fee if it does not prepay debt and permanently reduce the banks commitments by the cumulative amounts of million on september   million on december   and million on march  if it fails to meet any de leveraging target  the partnership must pay a leverage fee on such date  equal to the product of the total amounts outstanding under its bank credit facility and the senior secured note agreement on such date  and on september   on december  and on march  this leverage fee will accrue on the applicable date  but not be payable until the partnership refinances its bank credit facility 
under the sixth amendment  the maximum leverage ratio measured quarterly on a rolling four quarter basis is as follows to for the fiscal quarter ending march   to for the fiscal quarters ending june  and september   to for the fiscal quarter ending december   to for the fiscal quarter ending march   to for the fiscal quarter ending june   to for the fiscal quarter ending september   to for the fiscal quarter ending december  to for the fiscal quarters ending march  thru march   and 
table of contents to for the fiscal quarters ending june  and thereafter 
the minimum cash interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement  measured quarterly on a rolling four quarter basis is as follows under the sixth amendment to for the fiscal quarter ending march   to for the fiscal quarter ending june   to for the fiscal quarter ending september   to for the fiscal quarter ending december   to for the fiscal quarter ending march   to for the fiscal quarter ending june   to for any fiscal quarters ending september  and december   to for any fiscal quarters ending march   and thereafter 
under the sixth amendment  no quarterly distributions may be paid to unitholders of the partnership unless the pik notes have been repaid and the leverage ratio is less than to 
if the leverage ratio is between to and to  the partnership may make the minimum quarterly distribution of up to per unit if the pik notes have been repaid 
if the leverage ratio is less than to  the partnership may make quarterly distributions to unitholders from available cash as provided by the partnership agreement if the pik notes have been repaid 
the pik notes are due six months after the earlier of the refinancing or maturity of its bank credit facility 
in order to repay the pik notes prior to their scheduled maturity  the partnership will need to amend or refinance its bank credit facility 
based on the partnership s forecasted leverage ratios for and the partnership s near term ability to refinance its bank credit facility  it does not anticipate making quarterly distributions in other than the distribution paid in february related to fourth quarter operating results 
the sixth amendment also limits the partnership s annual capital expenditures excluding maintenance capital expenditures to million in and million in and each year thereafter with unused amounts in any year being carried forward to the next year 
it is unlikely that the partnership will be able to make any acquisitions based on the terms of its credit facility and the current condition of the capital markets because the partnership may only use a portion of the proceeds from the incurrence of unsecured debt and the issuance of equity to make such acquisitions 
the sixth amendment also eliminated the accordion in the partnership s bank credit facility  which previously had permitted it to increase commitments thereunder by certain amounts if any bank was willing to undertake such commitment increase 
the sixth amendment also revised the terms for mandatory repayment of outstanding indebtedness from asset sales and proceeds from incurrence of unsecured debt and equity issuances 
proceeds from debt issuances and from equity issuances not required to prepay indebtedness are considered to be excess proceeds under the amended bank credit agreement 
the partnership may retain all excess proceeds 
the following table sets forth the amended prepayment terms of net proceeds from of net proceeds from of net proceeds from asset sales required debt issuances required equity issuance required leverage ratio for prepayment for prepayment for prepayment greater than or equal to greater or equal to and less than less than the leverage ratio is to be adjusted to give effect to proceeds from debt or equity issuance and the use of such proceeds for each proportional level of leverage ratio 
the prepayments are to be applied pro rata based on total debt including letter of credit obligations outstanding under the bank credit agreement and the total debt outstanding under the note agreement described 
table of contents below 
any prepayments of advances on the bank credit facility from proceeds from asset sales  debt or equity issuances will permanently reduce the borrowing capacity or commitment under the facility in an amount equal to of the amount of the prepayment

credit risk risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by the partnership s customers are a major concern in its business 
the partnership is subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by its customers and other counterparties  such as lenders and hedging counterparties 
any increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by its customers could adversely affect the results of operations and reduce the partnership s ability to make distributions to its unitholders 
many of the partnership s customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations  the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity 
recently  there has been a significant decline in the credit markets and the availability of credit 
additionally  many of the partnership s customers equity values have substantially declined 
the combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices  a 
table of contents reduction in borrowing bases under reserve based credit facilities and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in customers liquidity and ability to make payments or perform on their obligations to the partnership 
furthermore  some of the customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks  which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to the partnership 
inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years in the economy as a whole 
the midstream natural gas industry has experienced an increase in labor and material costs during the year and the first half of  although these increases did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the periods presented 
although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years  it is still a factor in the united states economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment and may increase the costs of labor and supplies 
to the extent permitted by competition  regulation and our existing agreements  we have and will continue to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of higher fees

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the partnership s primary market risk is the risk related to changes in the prices of natural gas and ngls 
in addition  it is exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt 
interest rate risk the partnership is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable rate bank credit facility 
at december  and  the bank credit facility had outstanding borrowings of million and million  respectively  which approximated fair value 
the partnership manages a portion of its interest rate exposure on variable rate debt by utilizing interest rate swaps  which allows conversion of a portion of variable rate debt into fixed rate debt 
in january  the partnership amended its existing interest rate swaps covering million of the variable rate 
table of contents debt to extend the period by one year coverage periods end from november through october and reduce the interest rates to a range of to 
in september  the partnership entered into additional interest rate swaps covering the million that converted the floating rate portion of the original swaps from three month libor to one month libor 
in addition the partnership entered into one new interest rate swap in january covering million of the variable rate debt for a period of one year at an interest rate of 
as of december   the fair value of these interest rate swaps was reflected as a liability of million million in net current liabilities and million in long term liabilities on the financial statements 
the partnership estimates that a increase or decrease in the interest rate would increase or decrease the fair value of these interest rate swaps by approximately million 
considering the interest rate swaps and the amount outstanding on its bank credit facility as of december   the partnership estimates that a increase or decrease in the interest rate would change its annual interest expense by approximately million for periods when the entire portion of the million of interest rate swaps are outstanding and million for annual periods after when all the interest rate swaps lapse 
at december  and  the partnership had total fixed rate debt obligations of million and million  respectively  consisting of its senior secured notes with a weighted average interest rate of 
the fair value of these fixed rate obligations was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the partnership estimates that a increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of the fixed rated debt its senior secured notes by million based on the debt obligations as of december  commodity price risk the partnership is subject to significant risks due to fluctuations in commodity prices 
its exposure to these risks is primarily in the gas processing component of its business 
the partnership currently processes gas under three main types of contractual arrangements processing margin contracts under this type of contract  the partnership pays the producer for the full amount of inlet gas to the plant  and makes a margin based on the difference between the value of liquids recovered from the processed natural gas as compared to the value of the natural gas volumes lost shrink in processing 
the partnership s margins from these contracts are high during periods of high liquids prices relative to natural gas prices  and can be negative during periods of high natural gas prices relative to liquids prices 
however  the partnership mitigates its risk of processing natural gas when its margins are negative under its current processing margin contracts primarily through its ability to bypass processing when it is not profitable for the partnership  or by contracts that revert to a minimum fee for processing if the natural gas must be processed to meet pipeline quality specifications 
percent of liquids contracts under these contracts  the partnership receives a fee in the form of a percentage of the liquids recovered  and the producer bears all the cost of the natural gas shrink 
therefore  its margins from these contracts are greater during periods of high liquids prices 
the partnership s margins from processing cannot become negative under percent of liquids contracts  but do decline during periods of low ngl prices 
fee based contracts under these contracts the partnership has no commodity price exposure  and is paid a fixed fee per unit of volume that is treated or conditioned 

table of contents gas processing margins by contract types  gathering and transportation margins and treating margins as a percent of total gross margin for the comparative year to date periods are as follows years ended december  gathering and transportation margin gas processing margins processing margin percent of liquids fee based total gas processing treating margin total the partnership has hedges in place at december  covering liquids volumes it expects to receive under percent of liquids pol contracts as set forth in the following table 
the relevant payment index price is the monthly average of the daily closing price for deliveries of commodities into mont belvieu  texas as reported by the oil price information service opis

the ngl volumes hedged  as set forth above  focus on pol contracts 
the partnership hedges pol exposure based on volumes considered hedgeable volumes committed under contracts that are long term in nature versus total pol volumes that include volumes that may fluctuate due to contractual terms  such as contracts with month to month processing options 
the partnership hedged of its hedgeable volumes at risk through the end of of total volumes at risk through the end of 
the partnership currently has not hedged any of its processing margin volumes for the partnership is also subject to price risk to a lesser extent for fluctuations in natural gas prices with respect to a portion of its gathering and transport services 
approximately of the natural gas the partnership markets is purchased at a percentage of the relevant natural gas index price  as opposed to a fixed discount to that price 
as a result of purchasing the natural gas at a percentage of the index price  resale margins are higher during periods of high natural gas prices and lower during periods of lower natural gas prices 
the partnership has hedged of its natural gas volumes at risk through the end of set forth in the table below is the volume of the natural gas purchased and sold at a fixed discount or premium to the index price and at a percentage discount or premium to the index price for the partnership s principal gathering and transmission systems and for its commercial services business for the year ended december

lig plants purchase the gathering system plant thermal reduction ptr 
another price risk the partnership faces is the risk of mismatching volumes of gas bought or sold on a monthly price versus volumes bought or sold on a daily price 
the partnership enters each month with a balanced book of natural gas bought and sold on the same basis 
however  it is normal to experience fluctuations in the volumes of natural gas bought or sold under either basis  which leaves it with short or long positions that must be covered 
the partnership uses financial swaps to mitigate the exposure at the time it is created to maintain a balanced position 
the partnership s primary commodity risk management objective is to reduce volatility in its cash flows 
the partnership maintains a risk management committee  including members of senior management  which oversees all hedging activity 
the partnership enters into hedges for natural gas and ngls using over the counter derivative financial instruments with only certain well capitalized counterparties which have been approved by its risk management committee 
the use of financial instruments may expose the partnership to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when sales volumes are less than expected requiring market purchases to meet commitments or counterparties fail to purchase the contracted quantities of natural gas or otherwise fail to perform 
to the extent that the partnership engages in hedging activities it may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  the partnership is similarly insulated against unfavorable changes in such prices 
as of december   outstanding natural gas swap agreements  ngl swap agreements  swing swap agreements  storage swap agreements and other derivative instruments were a net fair value asset of million 
the aggregate effect of a hypothetical increase in gas and ngls prices would result in a decrease of approximately million in the net fair value asset of these contracts as of december
