critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations  and which require them to make the most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
for additional information see note  significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements included in item we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test requires the identification of the reporting units  and comparison of the fair value of each of these reporting units to the respective carrying value 
the fair value of the reporting units is determined based on valuation techniques using the best information that is available  such as discounted cash flow projections 
if the carrying value is less than the fair value  no impairment exists and the second step is not performed 
if the carrying value is higher than the fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually at the same time every year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
the annual impairment tests are performed in the fourth quarter of each year 
intangible assets and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if impairment indicators exist  an assessment of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by such assets is made 
if the results of the analysis indicate impairment  the assets are adjusted to fair market value 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of years 
fully amortized intangible assets are removed from the cost and accumulated amortization accounts 
revenue recognition shared mail revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists and when services are rendered 
shared mail services are considered rendered when all printing  sorting  labeling and ancillary services have been provided and the package has been shipped and accepted by the usps 
there is no risk pertaining to customer acceptance and the sales arrangement specifies a fixed and determinable price and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we provide for an allowance for sales adjustments to estimate claims resulting from billing and sales adjustments in the event of incorrect invoicing  pricing disputes or untimely mailings of customers advertising material 
the amount of this reserve is evaluated monthly taking into account historical trends  specific items and trended sales adjustments 
neighborhood targeted the majority of neighborhood targeted products are newspaper delivered  and revenues are recognized in the period that the product is distributed 
for non newspaper delivered products  revenues are recognized when the product is shipped to the customer or distributed to the consumer via direct to door 
rop revenues are recognized on the date that the advertisement runs in the newspaper 
some customers have contracts whereby we earn a transaction fee and the media costs are pass through costs to the customer 
in such cases  we only recognize the transaction fee as revenue on the date the advertisement runs in the newspaper 
customer contracts can vary  which may lead to material changes in revenues recognized for this segment  while not materially affecting absolute gross margin dollars 
fsi revenues from fsis and custom cooperative fsis are recognized in the period that the product is distributed in the newspaper or shared mail 
in accordance with industry practice  we generally pre bill fsi customers except remnant space in advance of the related distribution date

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item for additional discussion of significant valuation assumptions 
customer contract incentives we occasionally provide upfront cash incentives to key customers to secure the value of a long term contract 
the cost of such incentives are capitalized and amortized as a reduction to revenues over the life of the customer contract to match the associated value of the contract 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure along with assessing the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in tax laws  statutory tax rates  and estimates of our future taxable income levels could result in the realization of deferred tax assets being materially different from amounts provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item reserves for taxes are established for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities 
these tax reserves are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes  such as conclusion of tax audits  identification of new issues  changes in federal or state laws or interpretations of the law 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments  including forward foreign exchange and interest rate swap contracts  to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
the use of these financial instruments mitigates exposure to these risks with the intent of reducing the risks and the variability of our operating results 
we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
under sfas  all derivatives are recorded at fair value and the changes in fair value are immediately included in earnings if the derivatives are not designated and do not qualify as effective hedges 
if a derivative is a fair value hedge  then changes in the fair value of the derivative are offset against the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item 
if a derivative is a cash flow hedge  then changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings 
we formally document our hedge relationships  including the identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction 
effective derivatives are recorded at fair value in other current and long term assets and other current and long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
this process includes linking derivatives that are designated as hedges of specific assets  liabilities  firm commitments or forecasted transactions 
we also formally assess  both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter  whether a derivative used in a hedging transaction is highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item 
when it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting 
hedge ineffectiveness  determined in accordance with sfas no 
 did not have a material impact on operations for  or other matters we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as variable interest entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risks are interest rates on various debt instruments and foreign exchange rates at our international subsidiaries 
interest rates our borrowings under our credit agreement are subject to a variable rate of interest calculated on either a prime rate or a eurodollar rate 
to reduce our exposure to fluctuating interest rates  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted an aggregate of million  or  of our total variable rate debt  to fixed rate debt 
as of december   an aggregate principal amount of million outstanding under the term loan b and delayed draw portions of our senior secured credit facility was subject to interest rate volatility and the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was a liability of million 
foreign currency currencies to which we have exposure are the mexican peso  canadian dollar  british pound  polish zloty and euro 
currency restrictions are not expected to have a significant effect on our cash flows  liquidity  or capital resources 
we purchase the mexican peso under three to month forward foreign exchange contracts to stabilize the cost of coupon clearing in mexico 
under sfas no 
 our mexican peso forward exchange contracts meet the definition of cash flow hedges 
accordingly  the effective portion of fair value changes are recorded as a component of other comprehensive loss and any ineffective portion is reflected on the statement of income 
actual exchange losses or gains are recorded against production expense when the contracts are executed 
as of december   we had a commitment to purchase million in mexican pesos over the next months
