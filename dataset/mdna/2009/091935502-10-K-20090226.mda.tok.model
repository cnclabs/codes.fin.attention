we generate revenues from sales and licensing of products and from professional services 
our product revenues consist principally of revenues from annual software licenses  subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand application services  client hosting engagements and the sale of bundled software hardware systems 
we typically sell our licenses and hosting services under annually renewable agreements  and our clients generally pay the annual fees at the beginning of the contract term 
we recognize revenues from these agreements  as well as revenues from bundled software hardware systems  which do not recur  ratably over the contractual term  which is typically months 
billings associated with licenses and hosting services are recorded initially as deferred revenues and then recognized ratably into revenues over the contract term 
we also generate product revenues from the sale and licensing of third party software and hardware that is not bundled with our software 
these revenues are generally recognized upon shipment of the products to our clients 
we derive professional services revenues primarily from training  implementation  installation and other consulting services 
substantially all of our professional services are performed on a time and materials basis 
we recognize these revenues as the services are performed

blackboard connect tm is our alert and notification platform for our comprehensive communications and notification system solutions 
we generally price our software licenses on the basis of full time equivalent students or users 
accordingly  annual license fees are generally greater for larger institutions 
our operating expenses consist of cost of product revenues  cost of professional services revenues  research and development expenses  sales and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions 
major components of our cost of product revenues include license and other fees that we owe to third parties upon licensing software  and the cost of hardware that we bundle with our software 
we initially defer these costs and recognize them into expense over the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
cost of product revenues also includes amortization of internally developed technology available for sale  telecommunications costs related to the blackboard connect product  all direct materials and shipping and handling costs  employee compensation  stock based compensation and benefits for personnel supporting our hosting  support and production functions  as well as related facility rent  communication costs  utilities  depreciation expense and cost of external professional services used in these functions 
all of these costs are expensed as incurred 
the costs of third party software and hardware that is not bundled with software are also expensed when incurred  normally upon delivery to our client 
cost of product revenues excludes amortization of acquired technology intangibles resulting from acquisitions  which is included as amortization of intangibles acquired in acquisitions 
amortization expense related to acquired technology was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents cost of professional services revenues primarily includes the costs of compensation  stock based compensation and benefits for employees and external consultants who are involved in the performance of professional services engagements for our clients  as well as travel and related costs  facility rent  communication costs  utilities and depreciation expense used in these functions 
all of these costs are expensed as incurred

all of these costs are expensed as incurred 
amortization of intangibles includes the amortization of costs associated with products  acquired technology  customer lists  non compete agreements and other identifiable intangible assets 
these intangible assets were recorded at the time of our acquisitions and relate to contractual agreements  technology and products that we continue to utilize in our business 
we held a warrant to purchase common stock in an entity that provides technology support services to educational institutions  including our customers  that was exercisable for of the shares of the entity 
this common stock warrant meets the definition of a derivative as defined by fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity 
other income of approximately million was recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in june related to the fair value adjustment of the common stock warrant 
on july   in connection with an equity transaction between this entity and a venture capital firm  we partially exercised the warrant for approximately one half of the shares originally exercisable under the warrant and sold the shares acquired upon exercise to the venture capital firm for approximately million 
concurrently  we entered into an amended common stock warrant agreement under which we can purchase up to of the shares of the entity upon exercise 
the fair value of the common stock warrant of approximately million is recorded as investment in common stock warrant on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we will continue to evaluate the fair value of this instrument in subsequent reporting periods  and any changes in value will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
during the preparation of these consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  fair value measures  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  fixed assets  long lived assets  including purchase accounting and goodwill  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 

table of contents the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies have been discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived from two sources product sales and professional services sales 
product revenues include software license fees  subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand application services  hardware  premium support and maintenance  and hosting revenues 
professional services revenues include revenues from training and consulting services 
we recognize software license and maintenance revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
our software does not require significant modification and customization services 
where services are not essential to the functionality of the software  we begin to recognize software licensing revenues when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we do not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our support and maintenance separate from our software for the majority of our products 
accordingly  when licenses are sold in conjunction with our support and maintenance  we recognize the license revenue over the term of the maintenance service period 
when licenses of certain offerings are sold in conjunction with our support and maintenance where we do have vsoe  we recognize the license revenue upon delivery of the license and recognize the support and maintenance revenue over the term of the maintenance service period 
we sell hardware in two types of transactions sales of hardware in conjunction with our software licenses  which we refer to as bundled hardware software systems  and sales of hardware without software  which generally involve the resale of third party hardware 
after any necessary installation services are performed  hardware revenues are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we have not determined vsoe of the fair value for the separate components of bundled hardware software systems 
accordingly  when a bundled hardware software system is sold  all revenue is recognized over the term of the maintenance service period 
hardware sales without software are recognized upon delivery of the hardware to our client 
hosting revenues are recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  application of aicpa sop to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware 
accordingly  we recognize hosting fees and set up fees ratably over the term of the hosting agreement 
our sales arrangements may include professional services sold separately under professional services agreements that include training and consulting services 
revenues from these arrangements are accounted for separately from the license revenue because they meet the criteria for separate accounting  as defined in sop the more significant factors considered in determining whether revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of the professional services  such as consideration of whether the professional services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of professional services from other vendors and timing of payments 
professional services that are sold separately from license revenue are recognized as the professional services are performed on a time and materials basis 
we do not offer specified upgrades or incrementally significant discounts 
advance payments are recorded as deferred revenues until the product is shipped  services are delivered or obligations are met and the revenue can be recognized 
deferred revenues represent the excess of amounts invoiced over amounts recognized as revenues 
we provide non specified upgrades of our product only on a when and if available basis 
any 
table of contents contingencies  such as rights of return  conditions of acceptance  warranties and price protection  are accounted for under sop the effect of accounting for these contingencies included in revenue arrangements has not been material 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our clients to make required payments 
we analyze accounts receivable  historical percentages of uncollectible accounts and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we use an internal collection effort  which may include our sales and services groups as we deem appropriate 
although we believe that our reserves are adequate  if the financial condition of our clients deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if we underestimate the allowances required  additional allowances may be necessary  which will result in increased expense in the period in which such determination is made 
fair value measurements 
as of january   we adopted the sfas no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas defines fair value  establishes a fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value and expands required disclosure about fair value measurements 
the fas hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of inputs  or assumptions  used in the determination of fair value and requires financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level inputs other than level quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable level unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data we evaluate assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis to determine the appropriate level to classify them for each reporting period 
this determination requires significant judgments to be made by us 
long lived assets 
we record our long lived assets  such as property and equipment  at cost 
we review the carrying value of our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate these assets by examining estimated future cash flows to determine if their current recorded value is impaired 
we evaluate these cash flows by using weighted probability techniques as well as comparisons of past performance against projections 
assets may also be evaluated by identifying independent market values 
if we determine that an asset s carrying value is impaired  we will record a write down of the carrying value of the identified asset and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period in which the determination is made 
although we believe that the carrying values of our long lived assets are appropriately stated  changes in strategy or market conditions or significant technological developments could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
goodwill and intangible assets 
as the result of acquisitions  any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to tangible and intangible net assets acquired is based upon a preliminary valuation and our estimates and assumptions may be subject to change 
we assess the impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  we test our goodwill for impairment annually on october  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred  by comparing its fair value to its carrying value 
impairment may result from  among other things  deterioration in the performance of the acquired business  adverse market conditions  adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations  including changes that restrict the activities of the acquired business  and a variety of other circumstances 
if we determine that an impairment has occurred  we are required to record a write down of the carrying value and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period the determination is made 
although we believe goodwill is appropriately stated in our consolidated financial statements  changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an adjustment to the recorded balance 

table of contents the costs of defending and protecting patents are capitalized 
all costs incurred prior to filing a patent application are expensed as incurred 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets acquired technology years contracts and customer lists to years non compete agreements term of agreement trademarks and domain names years patents and related costs life of patent as of december  and  we had capitalized million and million  respectively  in costs of defending and protecting patents  due to expenses incurred in a suit against desirelearn  inc in which we have alleged infringement of one of our patents 
any change in our estimates based on ongoing litigation could materially reduce the valuation of these assets 
on february   we completed our merger with webct pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of october  pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of webct in a cash transaction for approximately million 
the effective cash purchase price of webct before transaction costs was approximately million  net of webct s february  cash balance of approximately million 
we have included the financial results of webct in our consolidated financial statements beginning february  the merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values as of february  the total purchase price was million  including the acquisition related transaction costs of approximately million 
acquisition related transaction costs include investment banking  legal and accounting fees  and other external costs directly related to the merger 
of the total purchase price  million has been allocated to net tangible assets and million has been allocated to definite lived intangible assets acquired 
definite lived intangible assets of million consist of the value assigned to webct s customer relationships of million and developed and core technology of million 
we allocated the remaining million to goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
during  we reduced our goodwill from the webct acquisition by approximately million primarily related to the recognition of deferred tax assets related to certain acquisition related transaction costs that were deductible for income tax purposes by webct 
consequently  after this adjustment  the net deferred tax asset acquired as a result of the webct merger was million 
during  we reduced goodwill by million related to net operating loss carry forwards that were utilized during and that had previously been recognized as goodwill in conjunction with the webct acquisition 
during  we purchased technology for million which will provide future functionality in our products 
the technology is classified as acquired technology and recorded as intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets at december  on november   we completed our merger with xythos software  inc xythos pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of november  xythos owned the underlying technology embedded in the blackboard content system 
this merger allows us to further augment the underlying technology of the blackboard content system and is a technology that we intend to incorporate into the broader blackboard academic suite and our new platform  blackboard learn 
pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of xythos in a cash transaction for approximately million  including acquisition related transaction costs and purchase accounting adjustments of million  which included a million reduction of deferred cost of revenues associated with 
table of contents the remaining value of a preexisting agreement with xythos

definite lived intangible assets of million consist of the value assigned to xythos s customer relationships of million and developed and core technology of million 
we allocated the remaining million to goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
on january   we completed our merger with nti pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated january  pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of nti in a transaction for approximately million  which includes million in cash and million in shares of our common stock 
the effective cash purchase price of nti before transaction costs was approximately million  net of nti s january  cash balance of approximately million 
we have included the financial results of nti in our consolidated financial statements beginning february  up to an additional million shares of our common stock may be issued contingent on the achievement of certain performance milestones 
the merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values as of january  of the total estimated purchase price  million has been allocated to net tangible liabilities and million has been allocated to definite lived intangible assets acquired 
definite lived intangible assets of million consist of the value assigned to nti s customer relationships of million  developed and core technology of million and trademarks of million 
we allocated the remaining million to goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax net operating loss carryforwards 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of total deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
income tax provision or benefit includes us federal  state and local and foreign income taxes and is based on pre tax income or loss 
all tax years since are subject to examination 
we follow the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
it prescribes that a company should use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured as the largest amount of the tax benefits  determined on a cumulative probability basis  which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as a result of the implementation of fin on january   we recognized an increase of million in the unrecognized tax benefit liability  which was accounted for as an increase to the january  accumulated deficit balance 
all of our unrecognized tax benefit liability would affect our effective tax rate if recognized 
prior to adoption of fin  accruals for tax contingencies were provided for in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
although we believe we had appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns for those years  we had recorded a liability for our best estimate of the 
table of contents probable loss on certain of those positions 
we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefit liability to change significantly over the next months 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for share based awards based on estimated fair values on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option based award on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model is affected by our stock price  as well as estimates regarding a number of variables including expected stock price volatility over the term of the award and projected employee stock option exercise activity 
recent accounting pronouncements

we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of the revision on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas requires all entities to report noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
its intention is to eliminate the diversity in practice regarding the accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests 
this statement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we do not believe that the provisions of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in february  the fasb issued staff position no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp 
fsp deferred the effective date of fas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of fsp for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued staff position no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion 
apb 
apb requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects an issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
the resulting debt discount is amortized over the period the convertible debt is expected to be outstanding as additional non cash interest expense 
apb is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
retrospective application to all periods presented is required except for instruments that were not outstanding during any of the periods that will be presented in the annual financial statements for the period of adoption but were outstanding during an earlier period 
we are currently finalizing the impact of the provisions of apb on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
we currently estimate that the additional non cash interest expense over the remaining period the notes are expected to be outstanding will be approximately million  of which approximately million will be recognized during in june  the eitf issued eitf no 
 determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf to clarify how to determine whether certain instruments or features were indexed to an entity s own stock 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently finalizing the impact of eitf on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and do not believe it will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents important factors considered by management we consider several factors in evaluating both our financial position and our operating performance 
these factors  while primarily focused on relevant financial information  also include other measures such as general market and economic conditions  competitor information and the status of the regulatory environment 
to understand our financial results  it is important to understand our business model and its impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting for the majority of our contracts requires us to initially record deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheet upon invoicing the sale and then to recognize revenue in subsequent periods ratably over the term of the contract in our consolidated statements of operations 
therefore  to better understand our operations  one must look at both revenues and deferred revenues 
in evaluating our revenues  we analyze them in three categories recurring ratable revenues  non recurring ratable revenues and other revenues 
recurring ratable revenues include those product revenues that are recognized ratably over the contract term  which is typically one year  and that recur each year assuming clients renew their contracts 
these revenues include revenues from the licensing of all of our software products  hosting arrangements  subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand application services and enhanced support and maintenance contracts related to our software products  including certain professional services performed by our professional services groups 
non recurring ratable revenues include those product revenues that are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically one year  but that do not contractually recur 
these revenues include certain hardware components of our blackboard transaction system products and certain third party hardware and software sold to our clients in conjunction with our software licenses 
other revenues include those revenues that are recognized as earned and are not deferred to future periods 
these revenues include professional services  the sales of bbone  certain sales of licenses  as well as the supplies and commissions we earn from publishers related to digital course supplement downloads 
in the case of both recurring ratable revenues and non recurring ratable revenues  an increase or decrease in the revenues in one period would be attributable primarily to increases or decreases in sales in prior periods 
unlike recurring ratable revenues  which benefit both from new license sales and from the renewal of previously existing licenses  non recurring ratable revenues primarily reflect one time sales that do not contractually renew 
other factors that we consider in making strategic cash flow and operating decisions include cash flows from operations  capital expenditures  total operating expenses and earnings 
during  the global economy entered a period of severe slowdown and the financial markets experienced significant dislocation 
while our subscription license model and our focus on educational institution clients has partially insulated us from the negative impact experienced by other technology companies  we were not unaffected by these developments during while our financial results for fiscal year were generally within our expectations  we believe that our financial results for would have been stronger had normal economic conditions prevailed during we believe that the economic slowdown and dislocation in the financial markets have caused some clients to delay their purchases with us causing a general lengthening of our sales cycles 
also  we believe that some clients may reduce or eliminate their purchases with us due to budgetary concerns and the uncertainty of operating in this environment 
budgetary restrictions are a particular concern for clients which rely on public funding as the budgets of many national  state or local governments have been negatively impacted by the economic slowdown and other factors 
though our products are often proven to be mission critical applications to our clients  the severity of the economic crisis is expected to impact some of our publicly funded clients significantly which could result in the loss of expected new sales or our failure to retain existing clients 

table of contents in response to the changing economic climate  during  we managed our expenses more stringently 
similarly in  we expect to continue to manage our expenses in response to our sales and financial performance through the year 
in addition  our treasury policies favor lower yielding investments such as investments issued or backed by the us treasury in order to mitigate investment risks 
as the financial dislocation occurred in  the yields on our investments declined and significantly reduced our interest income 
we expect to continue to earn yields on our cash and cash equivalents for the foreseeable future at rates which are significantly below historic rates which will negatively impact our profitability 
we believe that the full impact of the economic situation cannot currently be assessed and as a result  we will be required to make regular adjustments to our operating strategy in response to changing economic conditions 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods indicated 
year ended december  revenues product professional services total revenues operating expenses cost of product revenues cost of professional services revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative proceeds from patent judgment amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions total operating expenses operating margin the following table sets forth  for each component of revenues  the cost of these revenues expressed as a percentage of the related revenues for each of the periods indicated 
year ended december  cost of product revenues cost of professional services revenues year ended december  compared to year ended december  our total revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  
table of contents a detail of our total revenues by classification is as follows product professional product professional revenues services revenues total revenues services revenues total in millions unaudited recurring ratable revenues non recurring ratable revenues other revenues total revenues product revenues 
product revenues  including domestic and international  for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  recurring ratable product revenues increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a million increase in revenues recognized for subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand application services primarily related to blackboard connect  which we acquired from nti in january the increase was also due to a million increase in revenues from blackboard learning system enterprise licenses which was attributable to current and prior period sales to new and existing clients  the continued shift of our existing clients from the blackboard learning system basic products to the blackboard learning system enterprise products and the cross selling of other enterprise products to existing clients 
the blackboard learning system enterprise products have additional functionality that is not available in the blackboard learning system basic products and consequently some blackboard learning system basic product clients upgrade to the blackboard learning system enterprise products 
licenses of the enterprise version of the blackboard learning system products have higher average pricing  which normally results in at least twice the contractual value as compared to blackboard learning system basic product licenses 
the remaining increase in recurring ratable product revenues primarily resulted from a million increase in hosting revenues 
the increase in non recurring ratable product revenues was primarily due to an increase in sales of annual publisher licenses and sales of blackboard commerce suite hardware products 
the increase in other product revenues was primarily due to an increase in sales related to certain of our content management software products offset in part by a decrease in sales of certain third party software and hardware products 
of our total revenues  our total international revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  international product revenues  which consist primarily of recurring ratable product revenues  were million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in international recurring ratable product revenues was primarily due to an increase in international revenues from blackboard academic suite enterprise products resulting from prior period sales to new and existing clients 
the increase in international revenues also reflects our investment in increasing the size of our international sales force and international marketing efforts during prior periods  which expanded our international presence and enabled us to sell more of our products to new and existing clients in our international markets 
professional services revenues 
professional services revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in professional services revenues was primarily attributable to increased sales of certain enhanced support and maintenance services 
as a percentage of total revenues  professional services revenues for the year ended december  were as compared to for the

table of contents quarterly results our quarterly operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally due to the timing of client budget cycles and student attendance at client facilities 
historically  we have had lower new sales in our first and fourth quarters than in the remainder of the year 
our expenses  however  do not vary significantly with these changes and  as a result  such expenses do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
historically  we have performed a disproportionate amount of our professional services  the revenue from which is recognized as performed  in our second and third quarters each year 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the uneven seasonal demand for our licenses and services offerings 
the following table sets forth selected statements of operations and cash flow data for each of the quarters in the years ended december  and quarter ended march  june  september  december  in thousands total revenues total operating expenses income from operations net income net cash provided by operating activities quarter ended march  june  september  december  in thousands total revenues total operating expenses loss income from operations net loss income net cash used in provided by operating activities liquidity and capital resources changes in cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents were million at december  as compared to million at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the payment of the cash portion of the consideration in the nti merger we completed on january  pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of nti in a transaction for approximately million  which includes million in cash and million in our common stock  or approximately million shares of our common stock

net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  this increase for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due in part to the million in proceeds from the patent judgment against desirelearn 
in addition  accounts receivable increased 
table of contents million during the year ended december   net of the impact of acquired receivables related to the nti merger  due to an increase in invoicing associated with sales to new and existing clients and an increased number of renewing licenses during as compared to amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions increased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december   primarily due to the amortization of identified intangibles resulting from the nti merger 
we recognize revenues on annually renewable agreements  which results in deferred revenues for cash received prior to recognizing revenue 
deferred revenues increased by million during the year ended december   net of the impact of acquired deferred revenues related to the nti merger  due to the timing of certain client renewal invoicing and sales to new and existing clients during the current period 
net cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we paid approximately million for acquisitions which primarily related to the nti merger and excludes certain nti merger costs that were paid in during the year ended december   cash expenditures for purchases of property and equipment were million  which represents approximately of total revenues  and we made million in payments related to patent enforcement costs 
cash expenditures for purchases of property and equipment include payments related to the build out of our new global corporate headquarters in washington  dc which we occupied at the end of june on july   we received million in proceeds related to our sale of shares acquired upon exercise of a common stock warrant we held in an entity 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to the issuance of million of our convertible senior notes during the year ended december   described below 
during the year ended december   we received million in proceeds from exercise of stock options as compared to million during the year ended december  convertible promissory notes in june  we issued and sold the convertible senior notes due the notes in a public offering 
we used a portion of the proceeds to terminate and satisfy in full our indebtedness then outstanding of million under a senior secured credit facility  which we entered into in connection with our acquisition of webct  inc webct in  and to pay all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the termination 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we incurred million in debt issuance costs 
these costs were recorded as a debt discount and netted against the remaining principal amount outstanding 
the debt discount is being amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method through july   the first redemption date under the notes 
during the year ended december   we recorded total amortization expense of the debt discount of approximately million as interest expense 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year on the principal amount  accruing from june  interest is payable semi annually on january and july  commencing on january  we made interest payments of million each on july  and december  the notes will mature on july   subject to earlier conversion  redemption or repurchase 
the notes are convertible  under certain circumstances  into cash or a combination of cash and our common stock at an initial base conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes 
the base conversion rate represents an initial base conversion price of approximately 
if at the time of conversion the applicable price of our common stock exceeds the base conversion price  the conversion rate will be increased by up to an additional shares of our common stock per  principal amount of notes  as determined pursuant to a specified formula 
in general  upon conversion of a note  the holder of such note will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and our common stock for the note s conversion value in excess of such principal amount 
in accordance with the earnings per share method outlined in eitf  the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share  the diluted 
table of contents earnings per share effect of the shares that would be issued will be accounted for only if the average market price of our common stock price during the period is greater than the notes conversion price 
because the notes contain an adjusting conversion rate provision based on our common stock price and anti dilution adjustment provisions  at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate whether any adjustments to the conversion price would alter the effective conversion rate from the stated conversion rate and result in an in the money conversion 
whenever an adjustment to the conversion rate results in an increase in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion the notes  we would recognize a beneficial conversion feature in the period such a determination is made and amortize it over the remaining life of the notes 
as of december   a beneficial conversion feature under the notes did not exist 
holders may surrender their notes for conversion at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date for the notes only under the following circumstances prior to january   with respect to any calendar quarter beginning after june   if the closing price of our common stock for at least trading days in the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is more than of the base conversion price per share of the notes on such last trading day  on or after january   until the close of business on the business day preceding maturity  during the five business days after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of notes for each day of that period was less than of the product of the closing price of our common stock and the then applicable conversion rate of the notes  or upon the occurrence of other events or circumstances as specifically defined in the notes 
if a make whole fundamental change  as defined in the notes  occurs prior to july   we may be required in certain circumstances to increase the applicable conversion rate for any notes converted in connection with such fundamental change by a specified number of shares of our common stock 
the notes may not be redeemed by us prior to july   after which they may be redeemed by us  in whole at any time  or in part from time to time  on or after july  at a redemption price  payable in cash  of at of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase some or all of the notes on july   july  and july   or in the event of certain fundamental change transactions  at of the principal amount on the date of repurchase  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  payable in cash 
if such an event occurs  we would be required to repay the entire outstanding principal amount of million in cash  in addition to any other rights that the investors may have under the notes 
the notes are unsecured senior obligations and are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing such debt  and are effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and liabilities of our subsidiaries  including trade payables 
working capital needs we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and future cash expected to be provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products or services  the timing of enhancements to existing products and services and the timing of capital expenditures 
also  we may make investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
in addition  if the overall tightening of the credit market and a lack of available funding cause our clients to delay or to be unable to make their payments  our accounts receivable may increase and the relative aging of our receivables may deteriorate 
to the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
from time to time we may use our existing cash to repurchase shares of our common stock  outstanding indebtedness or other outstanding securities 
any such repurchases would depend on market conditions  the market price of our common stock  and management s assessment of our liquidity and cash flow needs 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  and  accordingly  there are no off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities 
obligations and commitments as of december   minimum future payments under existing notes payable and noncancelable operating leases are as follows for the years below notes operating payable leases in thousands and beyond total we have categorized the notes above assuming redemption on the first possible redemption date by the holders of the notes on july  we relocated our corporate headquarters in june to a building in washington  dc where we lease approximately  square feet of space under a lease expiring in june we also lease offices in northern virginia  phoenix  arizona  lynnfield  massachusetts  los angeles  california  san francisco  california  amsterdam  netherlands  vancouver  canada  and sydney  australia 
seasonality our operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally due to the timing of client budget cycles and student attendance at client facilities 
historically  we have had lower new sales in our first and fourth quarters than in the remainder of the year 
our expenses  however  do not vary significantly with these changes and  as a result  such expenses do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
historically  we have performed a disproportionate amount of our professional services  which are recognized as performed  in our second and third quarters each year 
in addition  deferred revenues can vary on a seasonal basis for the same reasons 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the uneven seasonal demand for our licenses and services offerings 
historically  we have generated more of our operating cash flow in the second half of the calendar year 
this pattern may change  however  as a result of acquisitions  new market opportunities or new product introductions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest income on our cash and cash equivalents is subject to interest rate fluctuations 
for the year ended december   a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have reduced our interest income by approximately million 
we have accounts on our foreign subsidiaries ledgers which are maintained in the respective subsidiary s local foreign currency and remeasured into the us dollar 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar and against the currencies of other countries in which we sell products and services including the canadian dollar  euro  british pound  japanese yen  australian dollar and others 
because of such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  other expense of million was recorded during the year ended december  for the year ended december   a one percentage point adverse change in these various exchange rates into the us dollar as of december  would have reduced our net other income by approximately million
