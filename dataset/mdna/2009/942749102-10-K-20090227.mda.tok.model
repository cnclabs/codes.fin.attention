item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading supplier of products for use in the water quality  water safety  water flow control and water conservation markets in both north america and europe with an expanding presence in asia 
for over years  we have designed and manufactured products that promote the comfort and safety of people and the quality and conservation of water used in commercial and residential applications 
we earn revenue and income almost exclusively from the sale of our products 
our principal product lines include water quality products  including backflow preventers and check valves for preventing reverse flow within water lines and fire protection systems and point of use water filtration and reverse osmosis systems for both commercial and residential applications  a wide range of water pressure regulators for both commercial and residential applications  drainage products for industrial  commercial  marine and residential applications  water supply products for commercial and residential applications  temperature and pressure relief valves for water heaters  boilers and associated systems  thermostatic mixing valves for tempering water in commercial and residential applications  systems for under floor radiant applications and hydraulic pump groups for gas boiler manufacturers and renewable energy applications  including solar and heat pump control packages  flexible stainless steel connectors for natural and liquid propane gas in commercial food service and residential applications  and large diameter butterfly valves for use in china s water infrastructure 
our business is reported in three geographic segments  north america  europe and china 
we distribute our products through three primary distribution channels  wholesale  do it yourself diy and original equipment manufacturers oems 
interest rates have an indirect effect on the demand for our products due to the effect such rates have on the number of new residential and commercial construction starts and remodeling projects 
all three of these activities have an impact on our sales and earnings 
an additional factor that has had an effect on our sales is fluctuation in foreign currencies  as a portion of our sales and certain portions of our costs  assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we believe that the factors relating to our future growth include our ability to continue to make selective acquisitions  both in our core markets as well as in new complementary markets  regulatory requirements relating to the quality and conservation of water  increased demand for clean water with continued enforcement of plumbing and building codes and a healthy economic environment 
we have completed acquisitions since divesting our industrial and oil and gas business in our acquisition strategy focuses on businesses that manufacture preferred brand name products that address our themes of water quality  water conservation  water safety and water flow control and related complementary markets 
we target businesses that will provide us with one or more of the following an entry into new markets  an increase in shelf space with existing customers  a new or improved technology or an expansion of the breadth of our water quality  water conservation  water safety and water flow control products for the residential and commercial markets 
in and  sales from acquisitions contributed approximately and  to our total sales growth over the prior year 
products representing a majority of our sales are subject to regulatory standards and code enforcement  which typically require that these products meet stringent performance criteria 
together with our commissioned manufacturers representatives  we have consistently advocated for the development and enforcement of such plumbing codes 
we are focused on maintaining stringent quality control and testing procedures at each of our manufacturing facilities in order to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements and take advantage of the resulting demand for compliant products 
we believe that the product development  product testing capability and investment in plant and equipment needed to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements  represent a barrier to entry for competitors 
we believe that  over the long term  there is an increasing demand among consumers for products to ensure water quality  which creates growth opportunities for our products 
adverse economic developments in created a challenging environment for us 
the credit crisis and recessionary pressures negatively impacted the primary markets we serve 
we took steps during the year to reduce costs and conserve cash 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced our workforce by in the us this step is expected to save us approximately million to million per year 
in addition to the reduction in force  we took several steps to help conserve cash into  including suspending our stock repurchase program  first freezing us wages and salaries and later implementing salary reductions  controlling capital spending levels and continuing to focus on working capital levels 
we also announced a further operational restructuring program to consolidate our manufacturing footprint in north america and china 
we will continue to evaluate acquisition candidates during  but we expect funds to be spent on acquisitions will be less than that spent in we are enhancing our focus on productivity and continuous improvement  and on managing our working capital levels as well as positioning many of our products to benefit when the market returns 
we believe that we are well positioned to weather the current economic crisis due to our ability to continue to generate positive cash flows and control spending levels 
we are not faced with any major liquidity events until  at which time million of our debt will come due 
we require substantial amounts of raw materials to produce our products  including bronze  brass  cast iron  steel and plastic  and substantially all of the raw materials we require are purchased from outside sources 
we have experienced volatility in the costs of certain raw materials  particularly copper 
bronze and brass are copper based alloys 
during the fourth quarter of  prices of copper dropped from highs experienced less than nine months earlier 
a risk we face is our ability to deal effectively with changes in raw material costs 
we manage this risk by monitoring related market prices  working with our suppliers to achieve the maximum level of stability in their costs and related pricing  seeking alternative supply sources when necessary  implementing cost reduction programs and passing increases in costs to our customers 
additionally from time to time we may use commodity futures contracts on a limited basis to manage this risk 
we are not able to predict whether or for how long this volatility will continue 
if costs continue to decrease  we may experience pressure from customers to reduce product pricing 
we are unable to predict the timing and impact that these pricing decreases could have to our profit margins 
another risk we face in all areas of our business is competition 
we consider brand preference  engineering specifications  code requirements  price  technological expertise  delivery times and breadth of product offerings to be the primary competitive factors 
as mentioned previously  we believe that the product development  product testing capability and investment in plant and equipment needed to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements  represent a barrier to entry for competitors 
we are committed to maintaining our capital equipment at a level consistent with current technologies  and thus we spent approximately million in and million in recent developments on february   a plan was approved by the board of directors to expand our program to consolidate our manufacturing footprint in north america and china 
the plan provides for the closure of three plants  with the relocation of those operations to existing facilities in either north america or china or to a new central facility in the united states 
the footprint consolidation pre tax charge will be approximately million  including severance charges of approximately million  relocation costs of approximately million and asset write downs of approximately million 
we also expect to record a net gain on property sales of million 
one time tax charges of approximately million regarding the payback of prior tax holiday benefits are also expected to be incurred as part of the building relocations 
approximately positions will be eliminated in connection with this consolidation 
the net after tax charge for this manufacturing consolidation program is expected to be approximately million million non cash  with costs being incurred through december we expect to spend approximately million in capital expenditures to consolidate operations 
we expect this entire project will be self funded through net proceeds from the sale of buildings and other assets being disposed of as part of the plan 
on february   we declared a quarterly dividend of eleven cents per share on each outstanding share of class a common stock and class b common stock 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our business is reported in three geographic segments north america  europe and china 
our net sales in each of these segments for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  year ended december  change to consolidated net sales net sales sales net sales sales change dollars in millions north america europe china total the change in net sales is attributable to the following change as a of consolidated net sales change as a of segment net sales north america europe china total north america europe china total north america europe china dollars in millions organic growth foreign exchange acquisitions disposal total organic net sales for decreased in north america primarily due to decreased sales in the wholesale market  where sales were lower than in unit sale declines  due in large part to the soft economy  were widespread across a number of product lines  with our backflow product line impacted the most 
organic sales in our north american retail market for remained relatively flat compared with  decreasing 
unit sale reductions in the retail market due to the soft economy were offset by selected price increases and new product rollouts 
given the current recession and more stringent bank lending standards  we believe that both the commercial and residential construction markets  which we sell into through our wholesale and diy channels  will continue to be soft through as a result  we believe that our sales in north america may decline in growth in north america due to acquisitions is due to the inclusion of sales from topway acquired in november organic net sales for increased in europe primarily due to an increase in sales into the european oem market as compared to oem sales were positively impacted in germany where sales of our products into alternative energy and energy conservation markets were strong 
sales into the wholesale market for decreased by as compared to and were negatively affected by declines in construction activity 
acquired sales growth in europe was due to the inclusion of bl cher for seven months in we expect sales in europe will increase on a constant currency basis in as bl cher will be reported for a full year and we expect alternative energy products sales to grow  offset by unit declines in our core product lines 
core sales are expected to be impacted by the widening recession in europe 
organic net sales for declined in china due to decreased sales in both the chinese domestic and export markets 
china sales were also negatively affected as compared to from the disposal of a commodity butterfly valve business during the fourth quarter of this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of large diameter butterfly valves to our water infrastructure customers during the increases in net sales due to foreign exchange in north america  europe and china were primarily due to the appreciation of the canadian dollar  euro and yuan  respectively  against the us dollar 
we cannot predict whether these currencies will continue to appreciate against the us dollar in future periods or whether future foreign exchange rate fluctuations will have a positive or negative impact on our net sales 
recent fluctuations in foreign currency rates portend a reduction in those currencies against the us dollar 
gross profit 
gross profit and gross profit as a percent of net sales gross margin for and were as follows year ended december  point change dollars in millions gross profit gross margin gross margin improved by basis points to in compared to the improvement was attributable primarily to margin improvements in north america and europe offset by declines in china 
north america s margin improved basis points to primarily due to the price increases implemented to offset prior raw material cost increases and  to a lesser extent  the mix of product sold 
further  north american gross margins were negatively impacted by approximately million  or approximately basis points on the prior year gross margin  for charges associated with product discontinuances and a change in estimate for workers compensation costs 
gross margin in europe increased to from primarily due to our ability to leverage additional volume from alternative energy product sales with better factory absorption levels due to the rationalization efforts made over the last two years in italy 
china gross margin deteriorated when compared to primarily due to excess capacity due to sales declines  value added tax increases  negative impact from the increase in the value of the chinese yuan against the us dollar and disruptions from a plant move and labor disputes 
during  we initiated a global restructuring program that was approved by our board of directors on october  the program includes plans to shut down five manufacturing facilities  right size a sixth facility and incur costs to relocate one of our china facilities 
in addition  we performed an evaluation of certain product lines in after completing this evaluation  we initiated a plan to discontinue certain product lines 
in accordance with the restructuring program and product line discontinuance commenced in  we anticipated spending million 
to date  we have incurred million of costs associated with the plans and have successfully shut down two manufacturing facilities and right sized another facility 
management is reviewing the status of the program and the timing of charges for the europe segment 
we anticipate the restructuring program will not be completed until  with the expectation that our europe segment will incur most of its costs during as such  previous estimates of savings from the programs will likely be achieved in rather than in the second half of the following table presents the total estimated pre tax charges to be incurred for the global restructuring program and product line discontinuances initiated in by our reportable segments and amounts charged to date reportable segment total spent to date in millions north america europe china total selling  general and administrative expenses

dollars in millions organic growth foreign exchange acquisitions disposal restructuring  goodwill and other total the decrease in consolidated organic operating income was due primarily to underutilization of capacity  in both china and  to a lesser extent  in north america caused by recessionary unit volume declines and one off events in china such as the labor strike  a plant move and natural disasters 
also  sg a expenses such as salaries  product liability and other fixed spending increased 
these items were partially offset by higher sales and better productivity in europe and reductions in certain sg a expenses such as shipping  pension costs and bad debts 
corporate costs decreased as the result of lower benefit costs  including lower stock based compensation and reduced costs from our nonqualified deferred compensation plan  and lower costs related to our sarbanes oxley compliance efforts and reduced legal costs 
the bl cher acquisition accounts for the net increase in operating profits from acquisitions 
the net increase in operating income from foreign exchange was primarily due to the appreciation of the euro against the us dollar 
we cannot predict whether these currencies will continue to appreciate against the us dollar in future periods or whether future foreign exchange rate fluctuations will have a positive or negative impact on our operating income 
interest income 
interest income decreased million  or  in compared to  primarily due to cash used to fund the bl cher acquisition and the stock buy back program initiated in november  as well as  a lower interest rate environment in as compared to interest expense

other income expense 
other expense increased million  or  in compared to  primarily due to foreign currency transaction losses  losses on metal commodity transactions and negative changes in asset valuation of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan 
foreign currency transaction losses increased in china  europe and canada in as compared to income taxes 
our effective tax rate for continuing operations increased to for from for the main driver of the increase was goodwill impairment 
a portion of the goodwill relates to stock acquisitions  which when impaired is not tax deductible 
our european effective rate declined due to provision releases and favorable tax treatments related to the bl cher acquisition financing

liquidity and capital resources we believe that effectively managing cash is necessary given the uncertainty in the current credit markets 
to achieve our cash management goals and manage any potential downside liquidity events  we have taken steps to control spending  increase productivity  reduce net working capital levels  control capital expenditures and to spend more conservatively on acquisitions 
with available cash of million at december   available capacity on our line of credit as discussed below  continued working capital management focus  no large debt payments due until  and with spending and cost cutting programs in place  we believe that we are well positioned to transition through what will be a challenging there are two recent negative developments related to inventory that could affect cash flows 
we have recently experienced de stocking issues within our customer base  which delay our ability to sell inventory 
further  more of our customers are adopting just in time inventory techniques to minimize their inventory investment  which puts pressure on our plants to hold inventory to meet expected near term customer demand 
both these developments could affect our ability to reduce inventory levels during and  therefore could reduce our cash flows 
also  we may have to consider external sources of financing for any large future acquisitions 
in  we generated million of cash from operating activities as compared to million in with management s enhanced focus in on working capital management  net working capital cash outflows have decreased from million in  to a net working capital cash inflow of million in  a million positive change 
better overall management of our inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable drove the improvement in working capital 
this change was offset to some extent by lower income from continuing operations 
we used million of net cash for investing activities in we used approximately million of net cash to fund a current year acquisition and spent million for acquisition costs related to prior years acquisitions 
we received proceeds of million from the sale of auction rate securities 
we invested million in capital equipment as part of our ongoing commitment to improve our manufacturing capabilities 
we expect to invest approximately in capital equipment in as of december   we held million in investments with an auction reset feature  or auction rate securities 
since december   we have reduced our exposure to auction rate securities by million 
we recorded an impairment of approximately million on the remaining securities in other expense in the consolidated statement of operations  as the decline in fair value is no longer considered to be temporary 
at the time of purchase  all the auction rate securities carried an aaa credit rating 
the auction rate securities we currently hold are all long term debt obligations secured by municipal bonds and student loans  and carry an aa or better credit rating 
liquidity for these auction rate securities ars is typically provided by an auction process  which allows holders to sell their notes  and resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually every to days 
each of the auction rate securities in our investment portfolio as of december  has experienced failed auctions 
there is no assurance that future auctions for these securities will succeed 
during the fourth quarter of  the company and its broker elected to participate in a settlement offer by ubs ag ubs 
under the terms of the settlement  the company and its broker were issued rights by ubs 
each right entitles the holder to sell the underlying ars at par to ubs at any time during the period june   through july  ubs could elect at any time from the settlement through the expiration of the settlement agreement to purchase the ars  in which case ubs would be required to pay par value for the ars 
we have determined that the rights are a separate investment and have recorded the value of approximately million in other income in our consolidated statement of operations 
we have classified the investment in ars and the ubs rights as long term investments as we can not predict if ubs will purchase or sell the ars before the earliest date at which we can require ubs to purchase the ars at par 
we used million of net cash from financing activities in this was primarily due to payments for our stock repurchase program  payments of debt and dividend payments  partially offset by increased borrowings under our line of credit 
our million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks is being used to support our acquisition program  working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes 
outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate determined by the type of loan plus an applicable margin determined by our debt rating  depending on the applicable base rate and our bond rating 
for  the average interest rate under the revolving credit facility for euro based borrowings was approximately 
there were no us dollar borrowings at december  the revolving credit facility includes operational and financial covenants customary for facilities of this type  including  among others  restrictions on additional indebtedness  liens and investments and maintenance of certain leverage ratios

we believe free cash flow to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance because it provides investors with a measure of our ability to generate cash  to repay debt and to fund acquisitions 
we may not be comparable to other companies that may define free cash flow differently 
free cash flow does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operations as an indication of our performance 
free cash flow should also not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operations as defined by gaap 
a reconciliation of net cash provided by continuing operations to free cash flow is provided below years ended december  in millions net cash provided by continuing operations less additions to property  plant  and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of property  plant  and equipment free cash flow our net debt to capitalization ratio is also a non gaap financial measure used by management 
management believes it to be an appropriate supplemental measure because it helps investors understand our ability to meet our financing needs and as a basis to evaluate our financial structure 
our computation may not be comparable to other companies that may define net debt to capitalization differently 
a reconciliation of long term debt including current portion to net debt and our net debt to capitalization ratio is provided below december  in millions current portion of long term debt plus long term debt  net of current portion less cash and cash equivalents net debt a reconciliation of capitalization is provided below december  in millions net debt total stockholders equity capitalization net debt to capitalization ratio our contractual obligations as of december  are presented in the following table payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt obligations  including current maturities a operating lease obligations capital lease obligations a pension contributions interest b earnout payments a other c total a as recognized in the consolidated balance sheet b assumes the balance on the revolving credit facility remains at million and the interest rate remains at approximately for the presented periods c includes commodity  capital expenditure commitments and other benefits at december  we maintain letters of credit that guarantee our performance or payment to third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions 
amounts outstanding were approximately million as of december  and million as of december  our letters of credit are primarily associated with insurance coverage and to a lesser extent foreign purchases and generally expire within one year of issuance 
these instruments may exist or expire without being drawn down  therefore they do not necessarily represent future cash flow obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements except for operating lease commitments  we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
application of critical accounting policies and key estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
a critical accounting estimate is an assumption about highly uncertain matters and could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements if another  also reasonable  amount were used  or  a change in the estimate is reasonably likely from period to period 
we base our assumptions on historical experience and on other estimates that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
there were no changes in accounting policies or significant changes in accounting estimates during we periodically discuss the development  selection and disclosure of the estimates with our audit committee 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met we have entered into a binding agreement  the product has shipped and title has passed  the sales price to the customer is fixed or is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue based upon a determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met  which  based on the majority of our shipping terms  is considered to have occurred upon shipment of the finished product 
some shipping terms require the goods to be received by the customer before title passes 
in those instances  revenues are not recognized until the customer has received the goods 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer returns and allowances and for customer programs 
provisions for returns and allowances are made at the time of sale  derived from historical trends and form a portion of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
customer programs  which are primarily annual volume incentive plans  allow customers to earn credit for attaining agreed upon purchase targets from us 
we record estimated reductions to revenue  made at the time of sale  for customer programs based on estimated purchase targets 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established to represent our best estimate of the net realizable value of the outstanding accounts receivable 
the development of our allowance for doubtful accounts varies by region but in general is based on a review of past due amounts  historical write off experience  as well as aging trends affecting specific accounts and general operational factors affecting all accounts 
in north america  management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable and establishes specific reserves against financially troubled customers 
in addition  factors are developed utilizing historical trends in bad debts  returns and allowances 
the ratio of these factors to sales on a rolling twelve month basis is applied to total outstanding receivables net of accounts specifically identified to establish a reserve 
in europe  management develops their bad debt allowance through an aging analysis of all their accounts 
in china  management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable and establishes specific reserves as needed 
in addition  for waterworks customers  whose payment terms are generally extended  we reserve the majority of accounts receivable in excess of one year from the invoice date 
we uniformly consider current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also aggressively monitor the creditworthiness of our largest customers  and periodically review customer credit limits to reduce risk 
if circumstances relating to specific customers change or unanticipated changes occur in the general business environment  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with costs determined primarily on a first in first out basis 
we utilize both specific product identification and historical product demand as the basis for determining our excess or obsolete inventory reserve 
we identify all inventories that exceed a range of one to four years in sales 
this is determined by comparing the current inventory balance against unit sales for the trailing twelve months 
new products added to inventory within the past twelve months are excluded from this analysis 
a portion of our products contain recoverable materials  therefore the excess and obsolete reserve is established net of any recoverable amounts 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand or changes in technology or features could result in additional obsolete inventory that is not saleable and could require additional inventory reserve provisions 
in certain countries  additional inventory reserves are maintained for potential shrinkage experienced in the manufacturing process 
the reserve is established based on the prior year s inventory losses adjusted for any change in the gross inventory balance 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
we use our judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment tests 
due to the current economic conditions as well as other business factors  we concluded that the goodwill of our water quality reporting unit was impaired on october   the time of our latest annual review 
we recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter in accordance with fas we perform our annual test for indicators of goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets impairment in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or sooner if indicators of impairment exist 
intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
values assigned to intangible assets are determined by an independent valuation firm based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations of the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
we use a discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
we have eight reporting units  based on the guidance contained in fas and related literature 
the discounted cash flow model includes a number of estimates of future cash flows 
we develop our assumptions based on our historical results including sales growth  operating profits  working capital levels and tax rates 
in our testing  we also incorporated assumptions regarding the current economic environment  including expectations regarding when the recession would end and at what point we would see orders return to historical levels 
we believe that the discounted cash flow model is sensitive to the selected discount rate 
we use third party experts to help develop appropriate discount rates for each reporting unit 
we use standard valuation practices to arrive at a weighted average cost of capital based on the market and guideline public companies 
the higher the discount rate  the lower the discounted cash flows 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions could significantly affect our valuations and result in impairments in the future 
other changes that may affect our valuations include  but are not limited to  product acceptances and regulatory approval 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from our estimates  we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the assets to their realizable value 
a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge to goodwill  which could have a material impact on the results of operations and financial position 
although we have not experienced goodwill impairment in our remaining reporting units  there can be no assurances that future goodwill impairment will not occur 
product liability and workers compensation costs because of retention requirements associated with our insurance policies  we are generally self insured for potential product liability claims and for workers compensation costs associated with workplace accidents 
for product liability cases in the us  management estimates expected settlement costs by utilizing loss reports provided by our third party administrators as well as developing internal historical trend factors based on our specific claims experience 
management utilizes the internal trend factors that reflect final expected settlement costs 
in other countries  we maintain insurance coverage with relatively high deductible payments  as product liability claims tend to be smaller than those experienced in the us changes in the nature of claims or the actual settlement amounts could affect the adequacy of this estimate and require changes to the provisions 
because the liability is an estimate  the ultimate liability may be more or less than reported 
workers compensation liabilities in the us are recognized for claims incurred including claims incurred but not reported and for changes in the status of individual case reserves 
at the time a workers compensation claim is filed  a liability is estimated to settle the claim 
the liability for workers compensation claims is determined based on management s estimates of the nature and severity of the claims and based on analysis provided by third party administrators and by various state statutes and reserve requirements 
we have developed our own trend factors based on our specific claims experience 
in other countries where workers compensation costs are applicable  we maintain insurance coverage with limited deductible payments 
because the liability is an estimate  the ultimate liability may be more or less than reported 
we determine the trend factors for product liability and workers compensation liabilities based on consultation with outside actuaries 
we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims in excess of all self insured positions 
any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
legal contingencies we are a defendant in numerous legal matters including those involving environmental law and product liability as discussed further in part i  item  business product liability  environmental and other litigation matters 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies fas  we determine whether an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated  net of any applicable insurance proceeds 
estimates of potential outcomes of these contingencies are developed in consultation with outside counsel 
while this assessment is based upon all available information  litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual liability to fully resolve this litigation cannot be predicted with any assurance of accuracy 
final resolution of these matters could possibly result in significant effects on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
pension benefits we account for our pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
employers accounting for pensions fas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r  fas 
in applying fas and fas  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
the primary assumptions are as follows weighted average discount rate this rate is used to estimate the current value of future benefits 
this rate is adjusted based on movement in long term interest rates 
expected long term rate of return on assets this rate is used to estimate future growth in investments and investment earnings 
the expected return is based upon a combination of historical market performance and anticipated future returns for a portfolio reflecting the mix of equity  debt and other investments indicative of our plan assets 
rates of increase in compensation levels this rate is used to estimate projected annual pay increases  which are used to determine the wage base used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
we determine these assumptions based on consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
any variance in these assumptions could have a significant impact on future recognized pension costs  assets and liabilities 
income taxes we estimate and use our expected annual effective income tax rates to accrue income taxes 
effective tax rates are determined based on budgeted earnings before taxes  including our best estimate of permanent items that will affect the effective rate for the year 
management periodically reviews these rates with outside tax advisors and changes are made if material variances from expectations are identified 
we recognize deferred taxes for the expected future consequences of events that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the rules of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes fas 
under fas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the book values and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities  using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
on january   we adopted the provisions of financial interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
the purpose of fin is to increase the comparability in financial reporting of income taxes 
fin requires that in order for a tax benefit to be booked in the income statement  the item in question must meet the more likely than not greater than likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities threshold 
the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
no cumulative effect was booked through beginning retained earnings 
during  we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately million as a result of finalizing federal and state income tax audits 
we estimate that it is reasonably possible that a portion of the currently remaining unrecognized tax benefit may be recognized by the end of as a result of the conclusion of the federal income tax audit 
the amount of expense accrued for penalties and interest is million worldwide 
as of december   we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million of which  approximately million if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
the difference between the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the amount that would impact the effective tax rate consists of the federal tax benefit of state income tax items 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp eitf issue no 
 determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities fsp eitf 
fsp eitf requires that unvested share based payment awards that contain rights to receive non forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents to be included in the two class method of computing earnings per share as described in statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 earnings per share 
this fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
accordingly  we will adopt fsp eitf in fiscal year the adoption of fsp eitf is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued fas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted principles  fas  which identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states the gaap hierarchy 
fas is effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the adoption of fas is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
this fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
the objective of this fsp is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under fas r  and other principles of gaap 
this fsp applies to all intangible assets  whether acquired in a business combination or otherwise  and shall be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years and applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
early adoption is prohibited 
the adoption of this fsp will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued fas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 fas  which expands the current disclosure requirements of fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  such that entities must now provide enhanced disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding how and why the entity uses derivatives  how derivatives and related hedged items are accounted for under fas and how derivatives and related hedged items affect the entity s financial position  performance and cash flow 
fas is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods beginning on or after november  accordingly  we will adopt fas in in december  the fasb issued fas no 
r  business combinations  fas r  which requires most identifiable assets  liabilities  non controlling interests  and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at full fair value 
under fas r  all business combinations will be accounted for under the acquisition method 
significant changes  among others  from current guidance resulting from fas r includes the requirement that contingent assets and liabilities and contingent consideration shall be recorded at estimated fair value as of the acquisition date  with any subsequent changes in fair value charged or credited to earnings 
further  acquisition related costs will be expensed rather than treated as part of the acquisition 
fas r is effective for periods beginning on or after december  we expect the adoption of fas r will increase costs charged to operations made after january  in december  the fasb issued fas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
 fas  which requires non controlling interests previously referred to as minority interest to be treated as a separate component of equity  not outside of equity as is current practice 
fas applies to non controlling interests and transactions with non controlling interest holders in consolidated financial statements 
fas is effective for periods beginning on or after december  we do not expect the adoption of fas will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment to fas no 
 fas  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is encouraged 
we have elected not to measure our eligible financial instruments at fair value and therefore the adoption of fas did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab  which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the impact of sab was not material to our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued fas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r fas  which requires an employer to a recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status  b measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and c recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur 
those changes are reported in other comprehensive income 
the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements are effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december  for companies with publicly traded equity securities 
the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after december   although earlier adoption is permitted 
as a result of the requirement to recognize the funded status of our benefit plans as of december   we recorded an increase in our pension liability of approximately million  a decrease of approximately million in other assets other  net and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately million  net of tax 
we have early adopted the measurement date provisions of fas effective january  our pension plans previously used a september measurement date 
all plans are now measured as of december  consistent with our fiscal year end 
the non cash effect of the adoption of the measurement date provisions of fas was not material and there was no effect on our results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued fas no 
 fair value measurements  fas  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
fas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements and was effective for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb issued fasb fsp which delayed the effective date of fas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  until fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
these nonfinancial items include assets and liabilities such as reporting units measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment test and nonfinancial assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
effective january   we adopted fas for financial assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring basis 
the partial adoption of fas for financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits 
this interpretation also provides guidance on measurement  de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we adopted the provisions of fin as of january  and the impact was not material to our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas amends fas statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
fas addresses the recognition and measurement of separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities and provides an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedge like offset accounting 
we adopted fas as of january  and the impact was not material to our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and fas 
fas amends fas  accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  and fas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and allows an entity to remeasure at fair value a hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation from the host  if the holder irrevocably elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the instrument would be recognized in earnings 
we adopted fas as of january  and the impact was not material to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and costs of certain raw materials used in the manufacturing process 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging underlying economic exposure 
the derivatives we use are instruments with liquid markets 
our consolidated earnings  which are reported in united states dollars  are subject to translation risks due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk is concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro  the us dollar and the canadian dollar  and the us dollar and the chinese yuan 
our foreign subsidiaries transact most business  including certain intercompany transactions  in foreign currencies 
such transactions are principally purchases or sales of materials and are denominated in european currencies or the us or canadian dollar 
we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage the risk related to intercompany purchases that occur during the course of a year and certain open foreign currency denominated commitments to sell products to third parties 
for  the amounts recorded in other income for the change in the fair value of such contracts was immaterial 
we have historically had a low exposure on the cost of our debt to changes in interest rates 
information about our long term debt including principal amounts and related interest rates appears in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  we purchase significant amounts of bronze ingot  brass rod  cast iron  steel and plastic  which are utilized in manufacturing our many product lines 
our operating results can be adversely affected by changes in commodity prices if we are unable to pass on related price increases to our customers 
we manage this risk by monitoring related market prices  working with our suppliers to achieve the maximum level of stability in their costs and related pricing  seeking alternative supply sources when necessary and passing increases in commodity costs to our customers  to the maximum extent possible  when they occur 
during  we entered into a series of copper swap contracts to fix the price per pound of copper for one customer 
these swaps are classified as economic hedges  as more fully explained in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the period ended december   we recorded million in losses associated with the copper swaps in other expense 
we believe that if copper prices continue to decrease that the open copper swap contracts will result in additional losses that may occur in a period different from when that cost is recovered from the customer 
the company used a discounted cash flow model for determining the value of the ars and the ubs rights 
as there is no active market for the ars and the rights are non transferable  we believe that the discounted cash flow model gives the best estimate of fair value at december  the model includes assumptions that are more fully explained in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the most sensitive of these assumptions is the illiquidity spread 
we engaged valuation experts to develop the models 
the illiquidity spread increases the discount rate  thereby decreasing the estimated fair value 
to value the rights issued by ubs  we used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the ars with the rights 
the value of the rights was determined by looking at the difference between the ars as determined compared to the ars with the rights 
while we believe the assumptions used are consistent with the current market view on the ars and are reasonable  different assumptions could significantly affect our valuation of ars
