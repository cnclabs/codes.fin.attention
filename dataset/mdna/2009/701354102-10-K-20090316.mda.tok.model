shelf registration on january   we filed a shelf registration shelf on form s with the securities and exchange commission 
the shelf is intended to provide flexibility to raise funds from the offering of various securities  up to million  over a period of up to three years  subject to market conditions 
securities offered under the shelf  which was declared effective on january   may be used to fund working capital  capital expenditures  vendor purchases  and other capital needs 
sale of equity securities to fund operations on march   we closed three separate but concurrent offerings for the sale of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and  warrants under the shelf for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
roth capital partners  llc roth  acted as underwriter for two of the three transactions 
the net proceeds from the offerings  after underwriter discounts  placement fees and other offering expenses  of approximately million will be used for general working capital purposes 
under the terms of the underwriting agreements  roth has the option  through march   to purchase additional common stock and warrants to cover over allotments 
if the over allotment options are exercised in full  we will receive additional proceeds  net of underwriter discounts  of approximately million 
to date  the underwriter has not exercised its over allotment options 
pursuant to one underwriting agreement the unit underwriting agreement  we sold  shares of common stock and  warrants as units  each unit consisting of one share of common stock and two tenths of a warrant  at an offering price of per unit the unit offering 
the warrants are exercisable  at an exercise price of per share  commencing march  and expire on march  in addition  we granted the underwriter an option to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock and  warrants  as units  to cover over allotments  if any 
the underwriter purchased units from us at a discount of per unit  representing eight percent of the public offering price 
the unit offering resulted in proceeds  after underwriter discounts  of approximately million 
the shares of common stock and the warrants comprising the units were issued separately and at all times have traded separately 
consequently  no units were actually issued 
pursuant to the other underwriting agreement the stock underwriting agreement  we sold  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share the common stock offering 
in addition  we granted the underwriter an option to purchase up to an additional  shares to cover over allotments  if any 
the underwriter purchased the common stock at a discount of per share  representing eight percent of the public offering price 
the common stock offering resulted in proceeds  after underwriter discounts  of approximately million 
in connection with the unit offering and the common stock offering  we also sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a price per share of to an executive officer and two directors of our company the management offering 
the management offering resulted in proceeds  after placement fees  of approximately million 
the aggregate of the three offerings represent of our outstanding common stock on an after issued basis 
general development of business in  we began educating prospective customers about the benefits of our technologies  with a primary focus on our rf transmit  or dp  technology and its unique ability to address certain high priority market needs related to mobile handset applications 
in  we completed our first dp integrated circuit ic which embodied many of the advancements of our technology and enabled us to begin demonstrating partially integrated prototypes 
throughout  and  we continued to further advance our prototype ics and increased the level of prototype integration while cultivating potential customer relationships 
our sales related activities during this three year period included prototype demonstrations of our dp platform  support of in depth technical due diligence by prospective customers  analysis of prospective customer product requirements  delivery of initial proposals and terms  and ultimately  negotiations of proposed business relationships 
in  we entered into licensing agreements with two customers  itt corporation itt and a confidential mobile handset chip supplier confidential licensee 
during  our product development efforts were largely focused on advancing our ics from prototype to production ready samples for our customers 
in addition  we delivered a development demonstration platform to itt for their use and  late in  we delivered production ready dp silicon samples and reference designs to our confidential licensee 
the delivered samples met or exceeded all critical functional and performance requirements under our agreement 
under the terms of our licensing agreements  we will be paid royalties on a per unit basis for products sold that incorporate our licensed intellectual property 
to date  we have not earned any royalties from these two customers as they have not yet commenced shipments of products incorporating our technologies 
our ability to generate revenues sufficient to offset costs is subject to our ability to successfully support our customers in completing their initial product designs and our ability to secure a reasonable market share through additional product offerings with our current customers and or the addition of new customers 
we believe our technology has substantial advantages over competing technologies  especially in the third generation  or g  mobile handset market and generations that are evolving beyond g  such as g mobile handset standards and applications 
industry studies indicate that over billion g handsets are expected to ship in  which represents over one third of total expected mobile handset shipments 
technology and products our wireless technologies represent unique  proprietary methods for processing rf waveforms in wireless applications 
the technology applies to the transmit baseband data to rf carrier signal and receive rf carrier signal to baseband data functions of a radio transceiver 
the transmit portion of the technology is called directpower  or dp  and enables the transformation of a digital baseband signal to an rf carrier waveform  at the desired power output level  in a single unified operation 
the receiver portion of the technology is called directdata  or dd  and enables the direct conversion of an rf carrier to baseband data signal 
although our primary sales efforts were focused on commercialization of our dp technology solutions  both of the agreements with customers in the commercial handset market contemplate incorporation of our dd technology as well 
we have completed engineering prototypes of our dp based ics targeted at mobile handset applications 
the ics which incorporate the core rf technology were produced using a silicon germanium sige process through a fabrication relationship with ibm microelectronics ibm 
late in  we completed the integration of the digital engine that controls our rf transmit ic and interfaces to the mobile phone baseband processor 
this digital engine was produced using a cmos semiconductor process through a third party fabrication relationship 
these ics are utilized to verify that our technology can be highly integrated in silicon and to demonstrate the benefits of the technology to target customers 
our current prototypes support functionality that is multi band meaning multiple frequencies and multi mode meaning multiple cellular standards and corresponding modulation formats 
our ics support multiple bands of cellular and pcs personal communications service frequencies and support the current and emerging cellular standards including gsm edge  cdma  w cdma  and hsupa 
we are also able to demonstrate e wimax and lte standards using pcs frequencies with our current ics 
we anticipate that future customers will either engage us to customize the implementation of the core technology based on their specific interface and product requirements or utilize our existing silicon designs 
the engagement will largely depend on the nature of the customer s product application 
our unique technologies process the rf waveform in a more optimal manner than existing technologies  thereby allowing the creation of handsets that have extended battery life  more easily incorporate multiple air interface standards and frequencies in smaller form factors  and reduce manufacturing costs 
our technologies provide such attractive benefits  in part  because of their unique integrated circuit architecture which enables efficient creation of highly accurate rf waveforms at the desired power levels thereby eliminating many of the limitations of legacy analog processing 
marketing and sales when we targeted the cellular industry in  our initial target customer base was limited to the top tier mobile handset manufacturers 
however  in and  mobile handset manufacturers were shifting rf innovation and developments to their chipset providers 
accordingly  we expanded our target customer base to include not only the mobile handset manufacturers  but also their component suppliers 
our first commercial chip customer and lgi are both component suppliers to mobile handset oems original equipment manufacturers and or odms original design manufacturers 
although our primary target market is the mobile handset industry  we have also explored potential relationships outside this target market to the extent that the requirements of the prospective customers are in concert with the needs of our primary target market 
this exploration resulted in our licensing agreement with itt in our marketing and sales activities are currently focused on developing and capitalizing on relationships in the mobile handset industry 
although we believe our direct customers will likely be the chipset suppliers in this industry  we continue to cultivate our relationships with the mobile handset manufacturers who  at a minimum  exert major influence on their chipset suppliers 
in addition  our market awareness campaign was expanded to include network providers who exert significant influence on the oems in the mobile handset industry 
our sales and sales support activities include prototype demonstrations of both semi integrated and highly integrated circuits that showcase the benefits of our technology  support of detailed technology due diligence discussions and testing  analysis of potential customer product roadmaps and integration alternatives  negotiations of specific terms of potential business relationships  and support of customers during their design process 
we believe the sales cycle  from the initial customer meeting to the consummation of a business arrangement  can vary from six to twenty four months 
the length of the sales cycle is a result of many factors  including the unique nature of our technology  intense technology evaluation and due diligence required based on the complex nature of rf technology and the unit volumes contemplated  in general  and the cellular specifications  in particular  our lack of tenure in the cellular industry  and the variety of integration decisions that must be evaluated by the customer in order to assess the specific value proposition for their needs 
we believe the average sales cycle will shorten significantly as our technologies gain adoption in this market 
we executed our first two customer contracts in and an additional customer arrangement in we believe additional customer design wins will occur and  furthermore  we believe that the rate of adoption of our technology will increase as shipments of products incorporating our technologies commence 
future sales may be influenced by the terms negotiated with our customers and our ability to expand internal resources to support multiple customers 
competition we operate in a highly competitive industry against companies with substantially greater financial  technical  and sales and marketing resources 
our technologies  which are currently being marketed in the mobile handset industry  face competition from incumbent providers of transceivers and power amplifiers including companies such as anadigics  infineon  freescale  qualcomm  rf microdevices  skyworks  and st ericsson  among others 
each of our competitors  however  also has the potential of becoming a licensee of our technologies 
we also compete against rf engineering groups within the research and development organizations of our target customers 
to date  we are unaware of any competing or emerging rf technologies that provide all the simultaneous benefits that our technology enables 
we believe we can gain adoption  and therefore compete  based on the performance and cost advantages enabled by our unique circuit architecture  as supported by a solid and defensible intellectual property ip portfolio 
our ip offering is capable of being compliant with all current mobile phone standards and can be configured to accept all standard baseband data inputs 
in addition  we believe that one or more of our technology s ability to provide improved power efficiencies  highly accurate rf carrier waveforms  smaller form factors and better manufacturing yields  provides a solution to existing problems in applications for g standards and beyond that the mobile handset industry is seeking to solve 
production and supply our current business strategy is focused largely on the incorporation of our technology into mobile handsets 
in instances where our customer is a licensee of our ip  the production capacity risk shifts to that customer 
under our agreement with lgi  we will be supplying unpackaged  tested ics 
those ics will be produced for us under various foundry relationships 
we currently have a fabrication relationship with ibm for the production of our prototype ics on a sige process 
we have also produced ics through taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited tsmc using a cmos semiconductor process 
we believe ibm and tsmc have sufficient capacity to meet our foreseeable needs 
in addition  our ics can be produced using different materials and processes  if necessary  to satisfy capacity requirements and or customer preferences 
patents and trademarks we consider our ip  including patents  patent applications  trademarks  and trade secrets to be significant to our competitive positioning 
we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents  copyrights  and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products 
as of december   we have obtained us and foreign patents related to our rf technologies and have patent applications pending in the united states and other countries 
we estimate the economic lives of our patents to be fifteen to twenty years 
in addition  from time to time  we obtain licenses from others for standard industry circuit designs that are integrated into our own ics as supporting components that are peripheral to our core technologies 
we believe there are multiple sources for these types of standard circuits and we estimate the economic lives of the licenses to be two to five years based on estimated technological obsolescence 
research and development for the years ended december   and  we spent approximately million  million  and million  respectively  on company sponsored research and development activities 
our research and development efforts have been devoted to the development and advancement of rf technologies  including the development of prototype ics for proof of concept purposes and production ready silicon samples and reference designs for our customers 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  of which are employed in engineering research and development  in sales and marketing  and in executive management  finance and administration 
our employees are not represented by a labor union 
we consider our employee relations satisfactory

item a 
risk factors in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business  operating results  liquidity and financial condition 
as a result of the risk factors set forth below  actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
we have had a history of losses which may ultimately compromise our ability to implement our business plan and continue in operation 
we have had losses in each year since our inception in  and continue to have an accumulated deficit which  at december   was approximately million 
the net loss for was approximately million 
to date  our technologies and products have not produced revenues sufficient to cover operating  research and development and overhead costs 
we also will continue to make expenditures on marketing  research and development  pursuit of patent protection for our intellectual property and operational costs for fulfillment of any contracts that we achieve for the sale of our products or technologies 
we expect that our revenues in will not bring the company to profitability 
if we are not able to generate sufficient revenues or we have insufficient capital resources  we will not be able to implement our business plan and investors will suffer a loss in their investment 
this may result in a change in our business strategies 
we expect to need additional capital in the future  which if we are unable to raise will result in our not being able to implement our business plan as currently formulated 
because we have had net losses and  to date  have not generated positive cash flow from operations  we have funded our operating losses from the sale of equity securities from time to time and the sale of our video division in we anticipate that our business plan will continue to require significant expenditures for research and development  patent protection  sales and marketing and general operations 
our current capital resources  including cash and cash equivalents at december  of million and the net proceeds of our march  offerings under the shelf registration statement of approximately million  are expected to sustain operations into the first quarter of thereafter  unless we increase revenues to a level that covers operating expenses or we reduce costs  we will require additional capital to fund these expenses 
financing  if any  may be in the form of loans or additional sales of equity securities 
a loan or the sale of preferred stock may result in the imposition of operational limitations and other covenants and payment obligations  any of which may be burdensome to us 
the sale of equity securities will result in dilution to the current shareholders ownership 
the long term continuation of our business plan is dependent upon the generation of sufficient revenues from the sale of our products  additional funding  reducing expenses or a combination of the foregoing 
the failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise capital or reduce expenses could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our long term business objectives 
our industry is subject to rapid technological changes which if we are unable to match or surpass  will result in a loss of competitive advantage and market opportunity 
because of the rapid technological development that regularly occurs in the microelectronics industry  we must continually devote substantial resources to developing and improving our technology and introducing new product offerings 
for example  in fiscal years and  we spent approximately million and million  respectively  on research and development  and we expect to continue to spend a significant amount in this area in the future 
these efforts and expenditures are necessary to establish and increase market share and  ultimately  to grow revenues 
if another company offers better products or our product development lags  a competitive position or market window opportunity may be lost  and therefore our revenues or revenue potential may be adversely affected 
if our products are not commercially accepted  our developmental investment will be lost and our ability to do business will be impaired 
there can be no assurance that our research and development will produce commercially viable technologies and products 
if existing or new technologies and products are not commercially accepted  the funds expended will not be recoverable  and our competitive and financial position will be adversely affected 
in addition  perception of our business prospects will be impaired with an adverse impact on our ability to do business and to attract capital and employees 
if our patents and intellectual property do not provide us with the anticipated market protections and competitive position  our business and prospects will be impaired 
we rely on our intellectual property  including patents and patent applications  to provide competitive advantage and protect us from theft of our intellectual property 
we believe that many of our patents are for entirely new technologies 
if the patents are not issued or issued patents are later shown not to be as broad as currently believed  or are otherwise challenged such that some or all of the protection is lost  we will suffer adverse effects from the loss of competitive advantage and our ability to offer unique products and technologies 
as a result  there would be an adverse impact on our financial condition and business prospects 
if we cannot demonstrate that our technologies and products can compete in the marketplace and are better than current competitive solutions  then we will not be able to generate the sales we need to continue our business and our prospects will be impaired 
we expect to face competition from chip suppliers such as anadigics  infineon  freescale  qualcomm  rf microdevices  skyworks  and st ericsson  among others 
our technology may also face competition from other emerging approaches or new technological advances which are under development and have not yet emerged 
if our technologies and products are not established in the market place as improvements over current  traditional chip solutions in wireless communications  our business prospects and financial condition will be adversely affected 
we rely  in large part  on key business and sales relationships for the successful commercialization of our products  which if not developed or maintained  will have an adverse impact on achieving market awareness and acceptance and will result in a loss of business opportunity 
to achieve a wide market awareness and acceptance of our products  as part of our business strategy  we will attempt to enter into a variety of business relationships with other companies which will incorporate our technologies into their products and or market products based on our technologies 
the successful commercialization of our products will depend in part on our ability to meet obligations under contracts with respect to the products and related development requirements 
the failure of these business relationships will limit the commercialization of our products which will have an adverse impact on our business development and our ability to generate revenues and recover development expenses 
we rely  in large part  on the ability of key customers to successfully develop and sell products incorporating our technologies  the failure of which will have an adverse impact on our business opportunities 
the successful commercialization of our products will depend  in part  on the success and timing of our customers product development and sales activities which may be impacted by factors outside of our control 
delays in or failure of our customers product development or sales activities will hinder the commercialization of our products which will have an adverse impact on our ability to generate revenues and recover development expenses 
we are highly dependent on mr 
jeffrey parker as our chief executive officer 
if his services were lost  it would have an adverse impact on our leadership and on how we are perceived within the industry and by investors 
because of mr 
parker s position in the company and the respect he has garnered in both the industry in which we operate and the investment community  the loss of his services might be seen as an impediment to the execution of our business plan 
if mr 
parker were no longer available to the company  investors might experience an adverse impact on their investment 
we currently have an employment agreement with mr 
parker and we maintain key employee life insurance for our benefit on mr 
parker 
if we are unable to attract or retain key executives and other highly skilled employees  we will not be able to execute our current business plans 
our business is very specialized  and therefore it is dependent on having skilled and specialized key executives and other employees to conduct our research  development and customer support activities 
the inability to obtain or retain these key executives and other specialized employees would have an adverse impact on the research  development and technical customer support activities that our products require 
these activities are instrumental to the successful execution of our business plans 
our outstanding options and warrants may affect the market price and liquidity of the common stock 
at december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding and had  exercisable options and warrants for the purchase of shares of common stock  assuming no terminations or forfeitures of such options and warrants 
on december  and  respectively  there will be  and  currently exercisable options and warrants assuming no new grants  exercises  terminations or forfeitures since december  
all of the underlying common stock of these securities is registered for sale to the holder or for public resale by the holder 
the amount of common stock available for the sales may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise capital and may affect the price and liquidity of the common stock in the public market 
in addition  the issuance of these shares of common stock will have a dilutive effect on current shareholders ownership 
provisions in the certificate of incorporation and by laws could have effects that conflict with the interest of shareholders 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
for example  the board of directors has the ability to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval  and there are pre notification provisions for director nominations and submissions of proposals from shareholders to a vote by all the shareholders under the by laws 
florida law also has anti takeover provisions in its corporate statute 
we have a shareholder protection rights plan that may delay or discourage someone from making an offer to purchase the company without prior consultation with the board of directors and management which may conflict with the interests of some of the shareholders 
on november   the board of directors adopted a shareholder protection rights plan which called for the issuance  on november   as a dividend  of rights to acquire fractional shares of preferred stock 
the rights are attached to the shares of common stock and transfer with them 
in the future the rights may become exchangeable for shares of preferred stock with various provisions that may discourage a takeover bid 
additionally  the rights have what are known as flip in and flip over provisions that could make any acquisition of the company more costly 
the principal objective of the plan is to cause someone interested in acquiring the company to negotiate with the board of directors rather than launch an unsolicited bid 
this plan may limit  prevent  or discourage a takeover offer that some shareholders may find more advantageous than a negotiated transaction 
a negotiated transaction may not be in the best interests of the shareholders

since  we have entered into three customer contracts for the incorporation of our technologies into wireless chipsets  modules and products 
two of the three customer agreements represent licensing agreements whereby our customers  itt and a confidential licensee will incorporate our ip into their own wireless semiconductor circuits and or radio products 
we have also recently entered into an agreement with lgi for the joint development and marketing of wireless radio modules that incorporate our technologies 
these modules  which will incorporate unpackaged integrated rf circuits supplied by us  are being designed for g mobile handset and data card applications 
since exiting our retail product business in  we have generated no product or royalty revenue from our wireless rf technologies 
we anticipate initial shipments of products incorporating our technologies to commence in we recognized service revenue in resulting from engineering design services provided to one of the licensees of our technology 
our ability to generate revenues sufficient to offset costs is subject to our ability to successfully support our customers in completing their initial product designs incorporating our technologies and expand our market opportunities through additional product offerings with our current customers and or the addition of new customers 
we believe our technology has substantial advantages over competing technologies  especially in the g mobile handset market and generations that are likely to evolve beyond g  such as g mobile handset standards and applications 
we have made significant investments in developing our technologies and products  the returns on which are dependent upon the generation of future revenues for realization 
since we have not yet generated revenues sufficient to offset our operating expenses  we have mostly relied on proceeds from the sale of equity securities to fund our operations 
we intend to continue to use our working capital to support future marketing  sales  research and development and general operations 
critical accounting policies we believe that the following are the critical accounting policies affecting the preparation of our consolidated financial statements intangible assets patents  copyrights and other intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated period of benefit 
we estimate the economic lives of our patents and copyrights to be fifteen to twenty years 
we estimate the economic lives of other intangible assets  including licenses  based on estimated technological obsolescence  to be two to five years  which is generally shorter than the contractual lives 
periodically  we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate impairment exists triggering event 
based on our cumulative net losses and negative cash flows from operations to date  we assess our working capital needs on an annual basis which is considered to be a triggering event for purposes of evaluating the recoverability of our intangible assets 
as a result of our evaluation  and the significant excess of our market capitalization over our net book value at december   we determined that no impairment exists with regard to our intangible assets 
accounting for share based compensation we account for our share based compensation plans in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment  which we adopted january  using the modified prospective method of adoption 
under this method  the fair value of share based awards is determined using various valuation models which require the use of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating how long employees will retain their stock options before exercising them  the volatility of our common stock price over the expected life of the equity award  and the rate at which equity awards will be forfeited unvested 
changes in these subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of share based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
we elected to adopt the alternative short cut method described in fasb staff position r for determining the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee share based compensation and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows for the income tax effects of employee share based compensation awards that were outstanding upon the adoption of sfas r 
revenue recognition we did not recognize any product or royalty revenue in  or we account for service revenue under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements and aicpa statement of position no 
sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
under the provisions of sab and sop  we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we use the percentage of completion method of accounting for cost reimbursement type contracts which specify a certain billable fee amount 
revenues are recognized as costs are incurred assuming that collection is reasonably assured 
our cost of sales includes the direct labor costs of engineering staff providing services under these contracts  as well as indirect costs including depreciation and amortization and allocated facilities costs 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on loss before taxes as reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when  based on available objective evidence  it is more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will not be realized 
in addition  on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
fin prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on recognition and classification of income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income tax disclosures 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delayed the effective date of sfas no 
for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
fsp fas partially defers the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of the fsp 
we have evaluated fsp fas and expect it to have no impact on our consolidated financial statements when adopted 
in april  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
this statement amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fsp no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is prohibited 
we have evaluated fsp no 
and expect it to have no impact on our consolidated financial statements when adopted 
in june  the fasb issued fsp no 
eitf fsp  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
this statement concluded that all outstanding unvested share based payment awards that contain rights to non forfeitable dividends participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders and therefore are considered participating securities for purposes of computing earnings per share 
fsp is effective january  we have evaluated fsp and expect it to have no impact on our consolidated financial statements when adopted as we currently have no participating securities  as defined by this statement 
results of operations for each of the years ended december   and revenues and gross margins we had no product or royalty revenues for the years ended december   or for the year ended december   we recognized approximately  in service revenue and approximately  or  in gross margin related to engineering consulting services provided to itt 
these services included analysis and evaluation of architectural design alternatives for incorporation of our dp technology into rf circuits based on various product specifications provided by itt 
cost of sales for engineering services includes the direct labor costs of engineering staff  as well as depreciation  amortization and allocated facilities costs 
indirect costs are generally allocated to cost of sales based on a percentage of the labor hours incurred for customer design support 
allocated indirect costs represent approximately of the total cost of sales 
we anticipate both royalty and design service revenue from our customers in based on our understanding of itt s product deployment programs and targeted sales milestones  we anticipate initial revenue in from itt s programs 
we believe we will achieve cumulative royalties of approximately million over the multi year contract with itt based on established royalty rates and our understanding of itt s product plans 
in addition  we delivered production ready ic designs and sample chips to our confidential licensee in december and continue to work closely with them to transition these designs to volume production chipsets  which they will manufacture through their own foundry relationships 
royalties from our confidential licensee will be earned as this licensee sells its chipset solution  incorporating our technologies  to mobile handset oems and odms 
we anticipate that royalties from this customer will range from approximately million to million in the first full year of their chipset shipments  depending upon the customer s product mix and unit volume as well as the timing of incorporation of our receiver technology into their chipsets 
we also believe the opportunity exists to significantly expand our royalty revenue from this customer based on the expected growth of the market in which their products are targeted and our customer s ability to capture increased market share for their products 
based on our relationship and initial program plan with lgi  we expect to begin generating revenue from the sale of unpackaged ics as early as the first quarter of the supply agreement terms between us and lgi will be completed as we finalize the product specifications under the program plan which we believe will occur during the first half of research and development expenses research and development expenses increased approximately million  or  from to and approximately million  or  from to the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increases in personnel and related costs  including taxes  benefits  travel costs and employee share based compensation expense  outside engineering design and consulting fees  prototype production costs  and software development tools and related maintenance costs 
personnel and related costs  net of share based compensation  increased approximately  from to as a result of compensation increases for existing engineering staff  the addition of personnel  including a vice president of engineering  and increased travel expense for engineering travel to both customer and outside consultant facilities  offset by decreases in cash incentive bonuses from to employee share based compensation expense increased by approximately  from to  primarily due to the noncash expense related to restricted shares and restricted share units issued to engineering executives and other employees in as long term incentive compensation and in lieu of cash incentive bonuses 
outside design consulting services increased approximately  from to as a result of the continued use of outside firms to supplement in house engineering resources  particularly with regard to our rf receiver ic development and the design layout of sample ics for the digital engine that controls our rf transmit ics 
prototype ic production costs increased approximately  from to we maintain a fairly regular cycle of prototype chip runs  however  the fabrication costs vary based on the materials specified and the number of variants requested on each run 
in  we produced certain sample ics on a tsmc foundry process in addition to our regular foundry runs with ibm 
software maintenance and support costs for engineering design software increased approximately  from to due to additional software tools and related maintenance costs required for ic design work 
the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increases in personnel cost and design consulting fees 
personnel and related costs increased approximately  due to the addition of personnel  compensation increases for existing engineering staff and increases in performance bonuses earned in over outside engineering design consulting costs increased approximately  from to due to increased use of outside design services to supplement in house engineering resources  offset by the expiration of a share based consulting agreement which reduced stock based compensation expense 
the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
our ability to successfully develop and introduce  on a timely basis  new and enhanced products and technologies will be a significant factor in our ability to grow and remain competitive 
although we anticipate decreases in our research and development expenses in  particularly with regard to outside design consulting services  we are committed to continue investing in our technology and product development and therefore we anticipate that we will use a substantial portion of our working capital for research and development activities in marketing and selling expenses marketing and selling expenses decreased approximately million or  from to and increased by approximately million or  from to the decrease in marketing and selling expenses from to was primarily due to decreases in personnel and related costs and non employee share based compensation  partially offset by increases in outside consulting fees and employee share based compensation expense 
personnel costs  net of share based compensation  decreased from to by approximately  primarily due to a reduction in employee cash bonuses  partially offset by increases in sales and marketing employee travel costs 
non employee share based compensation decreased approximately  from to primarily as a result of the reversal of previously recognized compensation expense on performance based options which expired unvested in these decreases were partially offset by increases in employee share based compensation expense of approximately  primarily due to the noncash expense related to restricted stock units issued to sales and marketing executives and other employees in as long term incentive compensation 
the increase in marketing and selling expenses from to was primarily due to increases in personnel costs  outside consulting and other professional fees and employee share based compensation expense 
personnel costs increased approximately  due to increases in personnel late in  compensation increases for existing employees and increases in performance bonuses earned from to outside consulting and other professional fees increased approximately  from to due to the use of consultants for expansion of network carrier and other potential customer relationships and legal fees incurred in relation to initial licensing agreements 
employee related share based compensation expense increased approximately  due to additional share based awards for sales and marketing employees 
we are committed to continuing our investment in marketing and selling efforts in order to continue to increase market awareness and penetration of our products and technologies  although we do not anticipate any significant increases in overall sales and marketing expenses in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive  finance and administrative personnel costs and costs incurred for insurance  shareholder relations and outside professional services 
our general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  or  from to and by million  or  from to the increase in general and administrative expenses from to is primarily due to increases in share based compensation expense partially offset by decreases in other personnel and related costs  insurance and corporate travel costs 
share based compensation expense increased approximately  from to  largely due to restricted stock units issued to named executives and other employees in as long term incentive compensation 
this increase is partially offset by a decrease in other personnel and related costs of approximately  primarily from a reduction in employee cash bonuses in in addition  the cost of our directors and officers liability insurance decreased by approximately  from to due to general market conditions and our corporate travel expenses decreased approximately the increase in general and administrative expenses from to is due to increases in personnel costs and employee share based compensation  offset partially by decreases in insurance costs 
personnel costs increased approximately  from to primarily due to an increase of approximately  in performance bonuses earned in over these bonuses were largely paid through the issuance of stock awards to our chief executive officer and chief financial officer in early employee stock based compensation expense increased approximately  from to due largely to the fair value expense related to long term incentive awards for our executive officers in and the cost of our directors and officers liability insurance decreased by approximately  from to due to general market conditions 
in addition  consulting and other professional fees  including share based consulting fees  decreased approximately  from to this decrease is primarily the result of increases in accounting and consulting fees related to our financial accounting system conversion in offset by a decrease in share based consulting fees primarily from a consulting agreement that expired in interest income and other interest income and other consist of interest earned on our investments  net gains recognized on the sale of investments  and other miscellaneous income and expense 
interest income and other decreased approximately million from to and approximately million from to the decrease in interest income and other from to is primarily the result of lower average cash balances and interest rates during the decrease in interest income and other from to is primarily due to a reduction in miscellaneous income of approximately  loss and loss per common share our net loss increased by approximately million or per common share from to and increased by approximately million or per common share from to the increase in net loss from to is primarily due to a million or increase in operating expenses  primarily related to research and development activities 
the increase in net loss from to is primarily due to a million or increase in operating expenses 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of approximately million including approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
for the year ended december   our cash and cash equivalents decreased by million from the previous year 
this decrease is a result of approximately million used for operations and million for payments of patent costs and purchases of software licenses and fixed assets used in operations 
this cash usage was partially offset by million in proceeds from the march sale of equity securities and approximately million in proceeds received from the exercise of options and warrants in for the year ended december   our cash and cash equivalents increased by million from the previous year 
this increase was a result of approximately million in proceeds from the february sale of equity securities and approximately million received from the exercise of approximately  options and warrants in  offset by the use of approximately million in cash for operating activities and approximately million for the purchase of property and equipment and for payment of patent costs in for the year ended december   our cash and cash equivalents increased approximately million as a result of million in proceeds from the sale of equity securities  million received from the exercise of options and warrants  and million in proceeds from the maturity of investments  offset by million of cash used for operations and an additional million used for the purchase of property and equipment and for payment of patent costs 
at december   we were not subject to any significant commitments to make additional capital expenditures 
our future business plans call for continued investment in sales  marketing  customer support and product development for our technologies and products 
our ability to generate revenues sufficient to offset costs is subject to our ability to successfully support our customers in completing their initial product designs incorporating our technologies and our ability secure a reasonable share of the market through additional product offerings with our current customers and or the addition of new customers 
we expect that revenue for will not be sufficient to cover our operational expenses for  and that our expected continued losses and use of cash will be funded from available working capital 
we assessed our short term liquidity needs based on the assumption that our working capital must be sufficient to cover our operational expenses for with an assumption of minimal revenue 
we expect our overall operating costs in will be lower than those incurred in as a result of the elimination of certain non recurring expenditures related to product development activities in as well as certain cost reduction measures implemented by us 
the non recurring product development expenditures primarily include outside engineering design resources utilized in to assist in the layout of certain ics under programs which were largely completed by the end of in addition  we anticipate reductions in travel costs  board expenses  professional fees and software support costs  among others  based on cost reduction measures that we have taken internally along with cost negotiations with various outside suppliers 
on january   we filed a shelf for the offering of various securities  up to million  over a period of up to three years 
the shelf  which was declared effective january   is intended to provide flexibility for our future capital needs and may be used to fund working capital  capital expenditures  vendor purchases  and other capital needs 
on march   we completed the sale of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and  warrants under the shelf for net proceeds  after underwriting discounts  placement fees and offering expenses  of approximately million 
we plan to use these proceeds  together with the million in cash and cash equivalents at december   to fund our working capital needs 
we believe our current capital resources  together with the proceeds from the march equity financing and our cost reduction efforts will be sufficient to support our liquidity requirements at least into the first quarter of in the event that sufficient working capital is not available to meet our liquidity needs  we believe additional liquidity could be obtained through the issuance of securities under our shelf in lieu of cash payments for certain vendor purchases  the surrender of key man life insurance policies for their cash value  and or additional cost reduction measures 
in addition  we may be able to meet certain liquidity needs through short or long term debt financing  although there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us 
we currently have no outstanding long term debt obligations 
the long term continuation of our business plan through and beyond is dependent upon the generation of sufficient revenues from our technologies and products to offset expenses 
in the event that we do not generate sufficient revenues  we will be required to obtain additional funding through public or private financing and or further reduce operating costs 
failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise additional capital through debt or equity financings  and or further reduce operating costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our long term liquidity needs and achieve our intended long term business objectives 
off balance sheet transactions  arrangements and other relationships  contractual obligations as of december   we have outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of common stock that were issued in connection with the sale of equity securities in various private placement transactions in   and these warrants have exercise prices ranging from to per share with a weighted average exercise price of and a weighted average remaining contractual life of years 
the estimated fair value of these warrants at their date of issuance of  is included in shareholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
during the year ended december   warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were exercised at a weighted average exercise price of  resulting in proceeds of approximately million 
refer to non plan options warrants in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for information regarding the outstanding warrants 
our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  were as follows see lease commitments in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item payments due by period contractual obligations total year or less years years after years operating leases item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market and economic conditions and is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
our cash equivalents which are primarily comprised of highly liquid money market instruments are subject to interest rate risk 
we are averse to principal loss and seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting market risk
