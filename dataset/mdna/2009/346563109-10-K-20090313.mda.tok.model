item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we derive revenues from memberships to our research products and from our advisory services and events 
we offer contracts for our research products that are typically renewable annually and payable in advance 
research revenues are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
accordingly  a substantial portion of our billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
clients purchase advisory services independently and or to supplement their memberships to our research 
billings attributable to advisory services are initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue when the services are performed 
event billings are also initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon completion of each event 
consequently  changes in the number and value of client contracts  both net decreases as well as net increases  impact our revenues and other results over the terms of the contracts 
our primary operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment  selling and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses  depreciation  and amortization of intangible assets 
cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services  including salaries  bonuses  employee benefits and non cash stock based compensation expense for research personnel and all associated editorial  travel  and support services 
selling and marketing expenses include salaries  bonuses  employee benefits  non cash stock based compensation expense  travel expenses  promotional costs  sales commissions  and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology  operations  finance  and strategy groups and our other administrative functions  including salaries  bonuses  employee benefits  and non cash stock based compensation expense 
overhead costs are allocated over these categories according to the number of employees in each group 
amortization of intangible assets represents the cost of amortizing acquired intangible assets such as customer relationships 
deferred revenue  agreement value  client retention  dollar retention and enrichment are metrics we believe are important to understanding our business 
we believe that the amount of deferred revenue  along with the agreement value of contracts to purchase research and advisory services  provide a significant measure of our business activity 
deferred revenue reflects billings in advance of revenue recognition as of the measurement date 
we calculate agreement value as the total revenues recognizable from all research and advisory service contracts in force at a given time but not including advisory only contracts  without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized 
no single client accounted for more than of agreement value at december  we calculate client retention as the percentage of client companies with memberships expiring during the most recent twelve month period who renewed one or more of those memberships during that same period 
we calculate dollar retention as a percentage of the dollar value of all client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve month period to the total dollar value of all client membership contracts that expired during the period 
we calculate enrichment as a percentage of the dollar value of client membership contracts renewed during the period to the dollar value of the corresponding expiring contracts 
client retention  dollar retention  and enrichment are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base 
a summary of our key metrics is as follows year ended absolute percentage december  increase increase decrease decrease deferred revenue in millions at year end agreement value in millions at year end client retention dollar retention enrichment number of clients at year end average contract for annual memberships for research only in force at year end in thousands average contract for annual memberships for research with advisory services in force at year end in thousands year ended absolute percentage december  increase increase decrease decrease deferred revenue in millions at year end agreement value in millions at year end client retention dollar retention enrichment number of clients at year end average contract for annual memberships for research only in force at year end in thousands average contract for annual memberships for research with advisory services in force at year end in thousands the increase in deferred revenue from to is primarily due to the acquisition of jupiterresearch 
the increase in agreement value from to is primarily due to an increase in the average contract size and to the acquisition of jupiterresearch 
the acquisition of jupiterresearch accounted for million of agreement value at december  the increase in average contract size for research only contracts and the decrease in average contract size for annual memberships for research which also included advisory services is a result of our objective to derive a higher percentage of our revenues from research services  which generally have higher operating margins because of the syndicated nature of these services 
client retention  dollar retention and enrichment all declined slightly year over year primarily due to the effects of a global economic downturn 
the increase in deferred revenue and agreement value from to is primarily due to increases in the number of clients and in the average contract size 
the increase in average contract size was due to an increased demand for our products 
the client retention decrease in compared to reflects a greater proportion of new business contracts in than previously experienced  which historically  and in  have renewed at lower rates 
the decrease in client retention as well as in enrichment in compared to also reflects lower than historical renewal and enrichment rates in europe and asia pacific due in part to organizational re alignment 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our policies and estimates  including but not limited to  those related to our revenue recognition  non cash stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts  non marketable investments  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes and valuation and impairment of marketable investments 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be those that require the most subjective judgment or those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
this is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
for a discussion of our other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f revenue recognition 
we generate revenues from licensing our research  performing advisory services  hosting events and conducting teleconferences 
we execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement 
revenues from contracts that contain multiple deliverables are allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values  however  the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions 
research service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
advisory service revenues are recognized during the period in which the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable 
forrester teleconferences revenue and reimbursed out of pocket expenses are recorded as advisory service revenues 
events revenues are recognized upon completion of the event 
annual memberships which include access to our research  unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry  unlimited participation in forrester teleconferences  and the right to attend one event  are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period 
we offer our clients a money back guarantee  which gives them the right to cancel their contracts prior to the end of the contract term 
for contracts that are terminating during the contract term  refunds would be issued for unused products or services 
furthermore  our revenue recognition determines the timing of commission expenses that are deferred and recorded as expense as the related revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date 
non cash stock based compensation 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation in net income 
to determine the fair value of stock based compensation  sfas no 
r requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding assumptions such as stock price volatility  expected option lives and forfeiture rates 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if circumstances change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
the development of an expected life assumption involves projecting employee exercise behaviors expected period between stock option vesting dates and stock option exercise dates 
we are also required to estimate future forfeitures for recognition of stock based compensation expense 
we will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the actual stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make contractually obligated payments 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management makes judgments regarding the collectibility of accounts receivable by specifically analyzing historical bad debts  customer concentrations  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  and if the financial condition of our customers were to improve  the allowances may be reduced accordingly 
non marketable investments 
we hold minority interests in technology related companies and equity investment funds 
these investments are in companies that are not publicly traded  and  therefore  because no established market for these securities exists  the estimate of the fair value of our investments requires significant judgment 
investments that are accounted for using the cost method are valued at cost unless an other than temporary impairment in its value occurs or the investment is liquidated 
for investments that are accounted for using the equity method we record our share of the investee s operating results each period 
we have a policy in place to review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies  which consists primarily of reviewing the investee s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects 
we record impairment charges when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill and intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we have goodwill and identified intangible assets with finite lives related to our acquisitions 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment 
in order to determine if an impairment exists  we compare the reporting unit s carrying value to the reporting unit s fair value 
determining the reporting unit s fair value requires us to make estimates on market conditions and operational performance 
absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist  we have selected november th as the date of performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
intangible assets with finite lives consist of acquired customer relationships  research content and trademarks and are valued according to the future cash flows they are estimated to produce 
these assigned values are amortized on an accelerated basis which matches the periods in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized 
tangible assets with finite lives consist of property and equipment  which are depreciated and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our identifiable intangible and long lived tangible assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
to compute whether intangible assets have been impaired  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value 
to the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value  the assets are written down to the estimated fair value of the asset 
income taxes 
we have deferred tax assets related to temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards primarily from the acquisitions of giga information group  inc in and jupiterresearch  llc  and its parent company  jupr holdings  inc jupiterresearch in 
such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible and before the carryforwards expire 
a valuation allowance is established for any deferred income tax asset for which realization is less than likely 
effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting for interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the impact of the adoption of fin is discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
valuation and impairment of marketable investments 
our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in us treasury and u 
s government agency securities  taxable and or tax exempt municipal notes some of which may have an auction reset feature  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper and money market funds 
in the current market environment  the assessment of the fair value of the debt securities can be difficult and subjective 
the volume of trading activity of certain debt instruments has declined  and the rapid changes occurring in today s financial markets can lead to changes in the fair value of financial instruments in relatively short periods of time 
sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value see note to the financial statements  each of which has different levels of difficulty and subjectivity involved in determining fair value 
level instruments generally represent quoted prices in active markets 
therefore  determining fair value for level instruments generally does not require significant management judgment  and the estimation is not difficult 
level instruments include inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the determination of fair value for level instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity 
we continually evaluate whether any available for sale securities have been impaired and  if so  whether such impairment is temporary or other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the company s cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value 
as of december   we held million of municipal bonds or of our total investment portfolio with an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ars with two investment advisors  both of which provided a valuation of level inputs for the ars investments 
one investment advisor utilized a discounted cash flow approach which resulted in a valuation of million and which was corroborated by a separate and comparable discounted cash flow analysis prepared by us 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates  based on data available at december   of interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums  and expecting holding periods of the ars 
the discounted cash flow technique was used to value the ars investments that were principally backed by student loans  which has had virtually no market activity since the auction failure began in the other investment advisor provided a valuation at par value based on the limited market activity  which we consider to be a level input  in addition to the underlying credit rating of the ars  which was generally related to municipalities 
we corroborated the valuation by reviewing confirmations of the trades and the underlying credit ratings of the securities 
the assumptions used in valuing both the ars and the put option are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change  which may lead us in the future to take an impairment charge for these securities 
in november  we accepted an offer the right from ubs ag ubs  one of our investment advisors  entitling us to sell at par value auction rate securities originally purchased from ubs approximately million  par value at anytime during a two year period from june  through july  ubs ars 
in accepting the right  we also granted ubs the authority to sell or auction the ubs ars at par at any time up until the expiration date of the offer and released ubs from any claims relating to the marketing and sale of the ubs ars 
although the company expects to sell its ubs ars under the right  if the right is not exercised before july   it will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligation to buy the company s ubs ars 
if the company does not exercise the right  the ubs ars will continue to accrue interest as determined by the auction process or the terms outlined in the prospectus of the ubs ars if the auction process fails 
ubs s obligations under the right are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the rights 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the rights 
if ubs has insufficient funding to buy back the ubs ars and the auction process continues to fail  then we may incur further losses on the carrying value of the ubs ars 
the enforceability of the right results in a put option and is recognized as a separate freestanding instrument that is accounted for separately from the underlying ubs ars investment 
we elected to account for this put option at fair value under fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities sfas 
we valued the put option using a discounted cash flow approach including estimates of interest rates and timing and amount of cash flow  based on data available at december  and adjusted for any bearer risk associated with ubs s financial ability to repurchase the ars beginning june  these assumptions are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change and any change in these assumptions and market conditions would affect the value of this right 
the value of the put option of million  which largely offsets the unrealized loss on the ubs ars securities subject to the right  is included in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  as long term investments and on the statement of income  together with the unrealized loss on the ubs ars subject to the right for the year ended december   as other income  net 
we believe that subsequent changes in the value of the put option will largely offset the subsequent fair value movements of the ubs ars  subject to the continued expected performance by the financial institution of its obligations under the agreement 
our remaining ars are held by another investment advisor  who has not made an offer similar to ubs and we continue to classify them as available for sale securities 
accordingly  any change in associated market value has been recorded against other comprehensive income during the year ended december  if the market conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to record unrealized losses in other comprehensive income or impairment charges 
we may not be able to liquidate these investments unless the issuer calls the security  a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  or the security matures

results of quarterly operations the following tables set forth a summary of our unaudited quarterly operating results for each of our eight most recently ended fiscal quarters 
we have derived this information from our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements  which  in the opinion of our management  have been prepared on a basis consistent with our financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
historically  our total revenues  operating profit  and net income in the fourth quarter have reflected the significant positive contribution of revenues attributable to advisory services performed 
as a result  we have historically experienced a decline in total revenues  operating profit  and net income from the quarter ended december to the quarter ended march our quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations

we generated cash from operating activities of million during and million during the increase in cash provided from operations is primarily attributable to improved net income and a decrease in accounts receivable in the fourth quarter of as compared with the fourth quarter of due to a slowdown in our business toward the end of during  we generated million of cash from investing activities  consisting primarily of million generated from net sales of marketable investments offset by million for the purchase of jupiterresearch 
during  we used million of cash in investing activities  consisting primarily of million used in net purchases of marketable investments 
we regularly invest excess funds in short and intermediate term interest bearing obligations of investment grade 
in june  we committed to invest million in two technology related private equity investment funds over an expected period of five years 
as of december   we had contributed approximately million to the funds 
the timing and amount of future contributions are entirely within the discretion of the investment funds 
in july  we adopted a cash bonus plan to pay bonuses  after the return of invested capital  measured by the proceeds of a portion of the share of net profits from these investments  if any  to certain key employees who must remain employed with us at the time any bonuses become payable under the plan  subject to the terms and conditions of the plan 
the principal purpose of this cash bonus plan was to retain key employees by allowing them to participate in a portion of the potential return from forrester s technology related investments if they remained employed by the company 
the plan was established at a time when technology and internet companies were growing significantly  and providing incentives to retain key employees during that time was important 
to date  we have not paid any bonuses under this plan 
we used million in cash from financing activities during and we generated  during the increased use of cash in financing activities is primarily attributable to an increase in purchases of our stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program  offset by an increase in proceeds from exercises of employee stock options 
through  our board of directors authorized an aggregate million to purchase our common stock under the stock repurchase program 
during and  we repurchased  and million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had cumulatively repurchased approximately million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
as of december   we held approximately million of state and municipal bonds with an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ars whose underlying assets are generally student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government or municipalities 
in february  auctions began to fail for these securities 
based on current market conditions  auction failures have continued and  as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
in november  we accepted an offer the right from ubs ag ubs  one of our investment advisors  entitling us to sell at par ars originally purchased from ubs approximately million  par value at anytime during a two year period from june  july  ubs ars 
we have the ability and intent to hold our ubs ars  valued at million at december   until a successful auction occurs and the ubs ars are liquidated at par value or until we are able to sell our ubs ars under the right 
based on our expected operating cash flows and our cash resources  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on our ars investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and marketable investments and long term investments of million 
we do not have a line of credit and do not anticipate the need for one in the foreseeable future 
we plan to continue to introduce new products and services and expect to make the requisite investments in our infrastructure during the next months 
we believe that our current cash balance  marketable investments  and cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital  financing activities  and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next two years 
as of december   we had future contractual obligations as follows for operating leases contractual future payments by year obligations total thereafter in thousands operating leases the above table does not offset the operating lease payments by future minimum rentals of  we expect to receive under subleases 
the above table also does not include the remaining  of capital commitments to the private equity funds described above due to the uncertainty as to the timing of capital calls made by such funds
