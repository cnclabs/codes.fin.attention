item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview cypress bioscience  inc provides therapeutics and personalized medicine services  facilitating improved and individualized patient care 
cypress goal is to address the evolving needs of specialist physicians and their patients by identifying unmet medical needs in the areas of pain  rheumatology  and physical medicine and rehabilitation  including challenging disorders such as fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis 
we believe this approach to improving patient care creates a unique partnership with physicians  and expect that offering personalized medicine services and therapeutic products through the same sales organization will provide cypress a differentiated commercial strategy and sustainable competitive advantage 
in january  we received approval from the us food and drug administration fda to market savella milnacipran hcl for the management of fibromyalgia fm 
savella is a dual reuptake inhibitor that preferentially blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine with higher potency than serotonin in vitro 
these two neurotransmitters are thought to play a central role in the symptoms for fm 
we exercised the right granted by our partner  forest laboratories  inc  or forest laboratories  to co promote savella for fm  and will detail it to rheumatologists  pain centers  and physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists in the us at the end of october  with our initial person sales force  we launched our first two novel personalized medicine services  avise pg and avise mcv  which are detailed to rheumatologists 
by early  we expanded the sales force to field based personnel in anticipation of the launch of savella 
personalized medicine services are tests which are validated analytically and clinically to provide physicians with actionable information to help manage their patients care  including predicting the likelihood of developing disease or optimizing therapy 
avise pg is a test that supports dose optimization and therapeutic decision making for patients taking methotrexate mtx  a widely used first line therapy for rheumatoid arthritis ra 
avise mcv is a test that aids in the diagnosis and prognosis of ra 
we believe that offering integrated personalized medicine services and pharmaceutical products through the same sales organization will facilitate physician access and improve the quality of the sales call  as well as help establish cypress as a leader targeting these specific specialists 
we intend to begin this process when we initiate promotion of savella to the same rheumatologists that we currently call upon for our first two personalized medicine services 
in march  we and our partner  forest laboratories  announced that we expect to ship savella to wholesalers and pharmacies by mid once we begin detailing savella to physicians  we will be reimbursed by forest laboratories for the savella sales calls based on forest laboratories cost to conduct such sales calls 
we also have a number of proof of concept poc stage opportunities in development  including two pharmaceutical candidates acquired in connection with our acquisition in march of proprius  inc  or proprius  and intend to pursue these opportunities on an ongoing basis 
we continue to evaluate various other potential strategic transactions  including the acquisition of products  product candidates  technologies and companies  and other alternatives 
milnacipran hcl has been approved for a non pain condition in over countries  with commercial experience outside the us since we obtained an exclusive license in the us and canada to milnacipran from pierre fabre medicament  or pierre fabre  in in january  we entered into a collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  a leading marketer of central nervous system  or cns  drugs with a strong franchise in the primary care and psychiatric markets 
as part of this collaboration with forest laboratories  we sublicensed our rights to milnacipran to forest laboratories for the united states  with an option to extend the territory to include canada  which was exercised in july as part of our agreements with both forest laboratories and pierre fabre  we have licensed any patents that may issue from our patent applications related to fm and milnacipran to forest laboratories and pierre fabre 

table of contents the efficacy of savella for the management of fibromyalgia was established in two double blind  placebo controlled  multicenter studies in adult patients years of age  subjects in study and  subjects in study enrolled patients met the american college of rheumatology acr criteria for fibromyalgia a history of widespread pain for months and pain present at or more of the specific tender point sites 
approximately of patients had a history of depression 
study was six months in duration and study was three months in duration 
a larger proportion of patients treated with savella than with placebo experienced a simultaneous reduction in pain from baseline of at least vas and also rated themselves as much improved or very much improved based on the patient global assessment pgic 
in addition  a larger proportion of patients treated with savella met the criteria for treatment response  as measured by the composite endpoint that concurrently evaluated improvement in pain vas  physical function sf pcs  and patient global assessment pgic  in fibromyalgia as compared to placebo 
in december  we announced positive top line results from the third phase iii trial for savella  a  patient  multicenter  double blind  placebo controlled phase iii study of savella for the management of fm 
these results  which confirm the findings from the two previous phase iii trials  showed that savella demonstrated a highly statistically significant difference compared to placebo in responder analyses based on a concurrent and clinically meaningful improvement in pain  patient global impression of change  and physical functioning 
on january   cypress and forest announced that savella was approved by the fda for the management of fibromyalgia 
in march  we and our partner  forest laboratories  announced that we expect to ship savella to wholesalers and pharmacies by mid savella was originally expected to be available in march forest and cypress submitted a minor post approval cosmetic formulation change for fda approval 
a response from the fda is anticipated no later than may 
additional information on our ongoing post approval clinical development program for savella can be found at www

in march  we announced the closing of the acquisition of proprius that included an upfront payment of approximately million in cash  as well as an additional million in potential milestone related payments associated with the development of proprius early clinical stage therapeutic candidates  which include a product to treat pain and a product to treat rheumatoid arthritis 
in february  we announced the closing of a transaction to acquire cellatope corporation s technology platform that uses cell bound complement activation products cb cap to diagnose and monitor debilitating autoimmune disorders  including systemic lupus erythematosus sle lupus 
we acquired the cb cap technology in a transaction that included a million cash payment to cellatope for the diagnostic technology as well as an additional million potential milestone payment associated with the commercial development of the lupus monitoring application 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues we recognized revenues under our collaborative agreement with forest laboratories of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues under our collaborative agreement is due to a million milestone payment and million reimbursement for one third of the costs paid in connection with the second phase iii trial for savella received from forest laboratories in february upon acceptance of our new drug application nda 
this compares to million in milestone payments received from forest laboratories during the revenues recorded during and consist solely of amounts earned or reimbursed to us pursuant to our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  entered into in january  for the development and marketing of savella 
such revenues include the recognition of the upfront payment of million from forest laboratories on a straight line basis over a period of years  an additional million license payment received from forest laboratories in july to extend the territory to include canada recognized on a straight line basis over the remainder of the year amortization period  sponsored development reimbursements  funding received from forest laboratories for certain of our employees devoted to the development of savella and the milestone payments and reimbursement payment described above 
the amount of sponsored development reimbursements from forest laboratories and funding received from forest laboratories for certain of our employees devoted to the development of savella changes periodically and may be eliminated based on the level of development activity 

table of contents revenue for our personalized medicine services business will be recognized as cash payments for the services are received 
while we began offering these services in october  no cash payments were received and accordingly  no revenue was recognized 
cost of personalized medicine testing services cost of personalized medicine testing services primarily consists of the compensation and benefits including bonuses and share based compensation of laboratory personnel  laboratory supplies  outside laboratory costs  shipping and distribution costs and facility related expenses 
our costs of personalized medicine services of million during are attributable to the launch of our personalized medicine services business during the fourth quarter of research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to a million milestone payment and million sublicense fee owed to pierre fabre upon nda acceptance in connection with our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  as well as costs incurred during in connection with our proof of concept studies for new compounds  development costs incurred during in connection with validation activities for our personalized medicine services and increased share based compensation expense related to options granted in this increase in research and development costs during was partially offset by costs incurred during in connection with the second phase iii savella trial  which was completed during the second quarter of during the year ended december   we incurred total costs of million  excluding milestone payments and sublicense fees  in connection with our phase iii savella programs compared to a total of million during the year ended december  effective january   pursuant to our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  forest laboratories assumed responsibility for funding all continuing development of savella  including the funding of clinical trials and regulatory approvals 
this funding received from forest laboratories for sponsored development reimbursements is included as a component of our revenue under collaborative agreement on the consolidated statement of operations 
we agreed upon an alternative cost sharing arrangement with forest laboratories for the second phase iii trial only 
in connection with this arrangement  we paid for a majority of the external costs of the second phase iii trial only  which were million 
forest repaid us million in and repaid the remaining million in january upon nda approval 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to hiring and recruitment costs in connection with the hiring of our sales force  including salary expense for the newly hired sales team  marketing expenses incurred in connection with the launch of our personalized medicine services  higher legal fees due to increased patent filing activity and increased share based compensation expense related to options granted during in process research and development in process research and development represents the fair value of acquired  to be completed research projects  including those related to personalized medicine services and therapeutic candidates  obtained in connection with the proprius acquisition that had not reached technological feasibility at the acquisition date and are not expected to have an alternative future use 
accordingly  the million of in process research and development  consisting of million related to personalized medicine services and million related to therapeutic candidates  was charged to our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of the total estimated value of approximately million of the research projects was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into a commercially viable product  estimating the future net cash flows from the project once commercially viable  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value using a discount rate of 
we expect material cash inflows relative to the cost of personalized medicine testing services to be generated by the personalized medicine services business starting in 
table of contents the personalized medicine services required certain validation work prior to the anticipated launch in late the validation work was completed and our laboratory was certified prior to the october launch 
the personalized medicine services are being marketed to rheumatologists 
the therapeutic products acquired from proprius consisted of early clinical stage candidates  which include a product to treat pain and a product to treat rheumatoid arthritis 
we are planning to launch proof of concept studies for both products in early substantial additional research and development will be required prior to any of our acquired therapeutic programs reaching technological feasibility 
in addition  once proof of concept studies are completed  each product candidate acquired will need to complete a series of clinical trials and receive fda or other regulatory approvals prior to commercialization 
due to the early stage of development for these therapeutic products  we are unable to estimate with certainty the time and investment required to develop these products 
these programs may never reach technological feasibility or develop into products that can be marketed profitably 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to develop and commercialize products before our competitors develop and commercialize products for the same indications 
the successful development of proprius therapeutic products could result in up to an additional million in potential milestone related payments 
interest income interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income for year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in is primarily due to a general decrease in interest rates and related yields experienced during compared to comparison of years ended december  and revenues we recognized revenues under our collaborative agreement with forest laboratories of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues under our collaborative agreement is due to a million milestone payment received from forest laboratories in june as a consequence of the results of our second phase iii trial for savella and a million milestone payment received from forest laboratories in december upon nda filing 
the increase in revenues under our collaborative agreement was partially offset by a decrease in sponsored development reimbursements during for costs incurred in connection with the extension trial to our first savella phase iii trial  which was completed during the fourth quarter of  and the third savella phase iii trial  which was initiated during the first quarter of the revenues recorded during and consist solely of amounts earned pursuant to our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  entered into in january  for the development and marketing of savella 
such revenues include the recognition of the upfront payment of million from forest laboratories on a straight line basis over a period of years  an additional million license payment received from forest laboratories in july to extend the territory to include canada recognized on a straight line basis over the remainder of the year amortization period  sponsored development reimbursements  funding received from forest laboratories for certain of our employees devoted to the development of savella and milestone payments received from forest laboratories during the second and fourth quarters of research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year december  the decrease in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to the completion of our extension trial to our first savella phase iii trial during the fourth quarter of  a decrease in costs incurred during in connection with the second savella phase iii trial  which was completed in the second quarter of  the discontinuation of our sleep apnea program during the second quarter of and funding provided during the first quarter of as an unrestricted grant to a university 
this decrease in research and development expenses was partially offset by costs incurred during in connection with the preparation of our savella nda  the initiation of proof of concept studies during for new compounds and increased wages expense associated with bonuses earned during and an increase in headcount 
during the year ended december   we incurred total costs of million in connection with our phase iii programs compared to a total of million during the year ended december  
table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increased wages expense associated with bonuses earned during and an increase in headcount  as well as higher legal fees during due to increased patent filing activity  increased nasdaq fees for the listing of additional shares issued in connection with our secondary offering completed in june and increased share based compensation expense related to options granted during interest income interest and other income  net  for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest and other income for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in is primarily due to an increase in our cash and investment balances during due to proceeds received from our secondary offering completed in june liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million compared to cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  working capital at december  totaled million compared to million at december  we have invested a substantial portion of our available cash in high quality marketable debt instruments of governmental agencies  commercial paper and certificates of deposit  which are within federally insured limits 
we have established guidelines relating to our investments with a goal to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
net cash provided by operating activities as disclosed in our statement of cash flows was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the primary source of cash from operations during the year ended december  was the million milestone payment and the million reimbursement of expenses received from forest laboratories  offset by cash used in operations including million for changes in operating assets and liabilities and non cash charges of million that includes million of the write off of in process research and development related to the acquisition of proprius 
the primary source of cash from operations during the year ended december  was the million in aggregate milestone payments received from forest laboratories and the million license payment received from forest laboratories to extend the territory to include canada  offset by cash used in operations including million for changes in operating assets and liabilities and non cash charges of million 
net cash used in investing activities as disclosed in our statement of cash flows was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the fluctuation in net cash from investing activities during the year ended december  compared to the corresponding prior year period was primarily a result of a net increase in proceeds from the sale of short term securities during the year ended december  offset by million in cash paid for the acquisition of proprius  which amount includes transaction costs 
net cash provided by financing activities as disclosed in our statement of cash flows was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities during compared to was primarily the result of proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of stock options and warrants during compared to net proceeds of approximately million from the completion of our secondary offering of common stock during june and proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of stock options during 
table of contents the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations at december  less than year years years more than total years operating leases purchase obligations total purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services  including consulting services  that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 
this includes contracts that are cancelable with notice and the payment of an early termination penalty 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty and also exclude accrued liabilities to the extent presented on the balance sheet as of december  other commercial and contractual commitments include potential milestone payments of up to million to pierre fabre of which million was paid in january upon nda approval and sublicense payments to pierre fabre based on of any upfront and milestone payments received from forest laboratories  milestone payments up to million associated with the development of proprius therapeutic candidates  milestone payments of up to million to alpharx in connection with the successful development and commercialization of a product associated with the in license of a topical nsaid therapy  milestone payments of up to million to collegium pharmaceutical  inc in connection with the reformulation and new product agreement entered into with collegium  milestone payments up to approximately million in connection with license agreements related to our poc programs and milestone payments up to million in connection with license agreements related to certain personalized medicine services 
in the event we move forward with development of a product or service under any of these arrangements  in most instances  we would also be obligated to make royalty payments 
unless and until we can consistently generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities  from revenue under our collaboration agreement with forest and  if available to us  cash from financings 
in june  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share resulting in proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting and offering costs 
our current expected primary cash needs on both a short term and long term basis are for supporting a commercial infrastructure  the development of candidates under our poc trials  including the two pharmaceutical candidates obtained in connection with the proprius acquisition  our personalized medicine services  and general research  working capital and other general corporate purposes and the identification  acquisition or license  and development of potential future products and services 
excluding the amounts payable under our merger agreement with proprius and our agreements with pierre fabre  alpharx  collegium  cellatope and various licensors under our poc trials and personalized medicine services business  the costs of in licensing or acquiring additional compounds or companies  funding clinical development for any product other than our ongoing poc trials that we may in license or acquire and the milestone payment and reimbursement for clinical trial costs received from forest laboratories in january  we estimate that based on our current business plan  net cash required to fund operating expenses will approximate million to million for the year if we include the milestone payment and reimbursement for clinical trial costs received from forest laboratories in january  we will require cash of approximately million to million to fund our operations for these amounts assume that we ship savella by mid and achieve royalty revenue and reimbursement for a portion of our sales force after the launch of savella 
in addition  one of our ongoing goals is to continue to identify and in license new products and product candidates 
in the event we acquire  license or develop any new products or product candidates  or begin any new poc  the amount to fund our operations for would increase  possibly materially 
we expect that our net losses will continue for at least the next several years as we seek to acquire  license or develop additional products  product candidates and services 
such losses may fluctuate  and the fluctuations may be substantial 

table of contents based on our current business plan  we believe our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at december  are sufficient to fund operations through at least however  we are actively continuing to evaluate various potential strategic transactions  including the potential acquisitions of products  product candidates and companies  and other alternatives 
in order to acquire or develop additional products and product candidates  we will likely require additional capital 
the amount of capital we require is dependent upon many forward looking factors that could significantly increase our capital requirements  including the following the costs of establishing a commercial infrastructure  the costs and timing of development and regulatory approvals for all our products and services  the costs associated with operating a clinical laboratory  the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products  product candidates and businesses  the costs of in licensing drug candidates  the ability of forest laboratories and us to reach sales milestones and other events under our collaboration agreement  and the costs of commercialization of any future products and services 
because we are unable to predict the outcome of the foregoing factors  some of which are beyond our control  we are unable to estimate with certainty our mid to long term capital needs 
unless and until we can generate a sufficient amount of product and service revenue  if ever  we expect to finance future capital needs through public or private debt or equity offerings or collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as interest income earned on cash balances 
we do not currently have any commitments or specific plans for future external funding 
we may not be able to raise additional capital and the funds we raise  if any  may not allow us to maintain our current and planned operations 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate our sales force or some or all of our development of existing or future product candidates and personalized medicine services and discontinue the evaluation or completion of any proposed acquisitions or strategic transactions 
to date  we have not had any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  research and development expenses  share based compensation and goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are the critical accounting policies that affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements see also the notes to our financial statements 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
amounts received for upfront license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period such arrangements require on going services or performance 
accordingly  the upfront payment of million from forest laboratories is being recognized over a period of years  which represents the estimated period of significant on going services and performance under our agreement with forest laboratories 
additionally  the million license payment received from forest laboratories in july to extend the territory to include canada is being 
table of contents recognized over the remainder of the year amortization period related to original upfront payment 
amounts received for sponsored development activities  including funding received for certain of our employees  are recognized as research costs are incurred over the period specified in the related agreement or as the services are performed 
amounts received for milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone  which requires substantive effort and was not readily assured at the inception of the agreement 
any amounts received prior to satisfying revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred revenue 
in connection with our personalized medicine services  such services are performed based on a written test requisition form 
we generally bill third party payers for these services upon generation and delivery of a report to the ordering physician 
as such  we take assignment of benefits and the risk of collection with the third party payer 
we currently do not have any contracts with third party payers 
we usually bill the patient directly for amounts owed after multiple requests for payment have been denied or only partially paid by the insurance carrier as allowed by law 
as relatively new tests  the personalized medicine services offered by us may not be covered under their reimbursement policies 
consequently  we pursue case by case reimbursement where policies are not in place or payment history has not been established 
as a result  at the time of delivery of the report to the ordering physician  and in the absence of a reimbursement contract or sufficient payment history  collectibility cannot reasonably be assured and revenues are therefore only recognized at the time cash is collected 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for our research and development personnel  fees paid to external service providers to conduct clinical trials  patient enrollment costs  fees and milestone payments under our license and development agreements and costs for facilities  supplies  materials and equipment 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
we accrue clinical trial expenses based on work performed  which relies on estimates of total costs incurred based on completion of patient studies and other events 
actual clinical trial costs may differ from estimated clinical trial costs and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
historically  adjustments have not resulted in material changes to research and development expenses  however  a modification in the protocol of a clinical trial or cancellation of a trial could result in a charge to our results of operations 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of revised statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes a compensation expense for all stock based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and b compensation expense for all stock based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
share based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model 
this estimate is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex inputs that require us to make significant estimates and judgments 
these inputs include the expected term of employee stock options  the expected volatility of our stock price  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on the output derived under the simplified method  as allowed under sab we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant using our historical price volatility based on our assessment that this approach is the most representative of future stock price trends 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 

table of contents sfas r requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
given the standard vesting provisions of our stock options and minimal historical turnover  we have not estimated forfeitures and instead adjust our share based compensation expense as forfeitures occur 
we believe that the impact on share based compensation between estimating forfeitures and recording the impact as the forfeitures occur would not be material 
for options granted before january  and on or after january   we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
as noted above  in order to calculate the compensation expense that we must recognize  we must make a variety of assumptions  all of which are based on our beliefs  expectations and assumptions at the time the assumptions are made 
these beliefs  expectations and assumptions may vary over time and we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 
goodwill on march   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of proprius  a privately held specialty pharmaceutical company 
the acquisition of proprius resulted in the recording of goodwill  which represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter  as well as when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

the provisions of sfas no 
require that we perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill to the carrying value of its long term assets 
if the carrying value of the long term assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test  whereby the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared to its implied fair value 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss equal to the difference would be recorded 
through december  there was no impairment identified through this analysis 
new accounting pronouncements in november  fasb issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements 
the objective of eitf issue no 
is to define collaborative arrangements and to establish reporting requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and the third parties 
eitf issue no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
eitf issue no 
shall be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf issue no 
to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired in connection with business combinations 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r on our results of operations and cash flows will depend on the terms and timing of future acquisitions  if any 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas 
sfas no 
improves the relevance  comparability and transparency of financial information provided to investors by requiring all entities to report noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries in the same way 
additionally  sfas no 
eliminates the diversity that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests by requiring they be treated as equity transactions 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  as of december   we did not hold any noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries  and will apply the provisions of sfas no 
when we have such noncontrolling interests 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have invested our excess cash in united states government securities  commercial paper  corporate debt securities  certificates of deposit and money market funds with strong credit ratings 
as a result  our interest income is most sensitive to changes in the general level of united states interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the investment grade securities we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve over a three month period would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates
