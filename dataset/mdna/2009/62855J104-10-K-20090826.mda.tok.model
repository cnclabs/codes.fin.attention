item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading healthcare company focused on the development and marketing of novel molecular diagnostic products 
we employ a number of proprietary technologies that help us to understand the genetic basis of human disease and the role that genes and their related proteins may play in the onset  progression and treatment of disease 
we use this information to guide the development of new molecular diagnostic products that are designed to assess an individual s risk for developing disease later in life predictive medicine  identify a patient s likelihood of responding to drug therapy and guide a patient s dosing to ensure optimal treatment personalized medicine  or assess a patient s risk of disease progression and disease recurrence prognostic medicine 
on february   our board of directors declared a two for one split of the company s common stock  effected in the form of a stock dividend 
the stock dividend was distributed on march  to shareholders of record on march  all historical share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to reflect the stock split 
on june   we separated our molecular diagnostic business from our research and drug development businesses for the treatment of cancers and other diseases by transferring our research and drug development businesses into our then wholly owned subsidiary  myriad pharmaceuticals  inc  or mpi 
we contributed substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities from the research and drug development businesses and million in cash and marketable securities to mpi 
all outstanding shares of mpi were then distributed to our stockholders as a pro rata  tax free dividend on june  by issuing one share of mpi common stock for every four shares of our common stock to stockholders of record on june  the separation resulted in mpi operating as an independent entity with its own publicly traded stock 
the results of operations for the former research and drug development activities conducted by us and by mpi until june  are included as part of this report as discontinued operations 
we do not have any ownership or other form of interest in mpi subsequent to the separation 
during the fiscal year ended june   we devoted our resources to supporting our predictive medicine  personalized medicine and prognostic medicine products  as well as to the research and development of future molecular diagnostic candidates 
see note segment and related information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding our operating segments 
our revenues consisted primarily of sales of molecular diagnostic products 
during the year ended june   we reported income from continuing operations of million and total net income of million 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we incurred research and development expenses from continuing operations of million  million  and million for the years ended june    and  respectively 
our research and development expenses include costs incurred in the development and improvement of our seven current molecular diagnostic product offerings bracanalysis  colaris  colaris ap  melaris  theraguide fu  ondose  and prezeon and for costs incurred for the discovery  development and validation of other molecular diagnostic product candidates 
we expect to incur sales  marketing and other expenses in connection with building our molecular diagnostic business 
we expect that earnings will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies which are both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often 
table of contents as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  share based payment expense  and income taxes revenue recognition 
molecular diagnostic revenue includes revenue from the sale of molecular diagnostic products for our predictive  personalized and prognostic medicine products  and is recorded at the invoiced amount net of any discounts or allowances 
molecular diagnostic revenue is recognized upon completion of the test  communication of results  and when collectability is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
trade accounts receivable are comprised of amounts due from sales of our molecular diagnostic products  which are recorded net of any discounts or contractual allowances 
we analyze trade accounts receivable and consider historic experience  customer creditworthiness  facts and circumstances specific to outstanding balances  and payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we periodically evaluate and adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts through a charge or credit to expense when trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate 
such changes in estimate could materially affect our results of operations or financial position  however  to date these changes have not been material 
it is possible that we may need to adjust our estimates in future periods 
after a review of our allowance for doubtful accounts as of june  and  we have determined that a hypothetical ten percent increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts would result in additional bad debt expense and an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively 
share based payment expense 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  sets accounting requirements for share based compensation to employees  including employee stock purchase plans  and requires us to recognize in our consolidated statements of operations the grant date fair value of our stock options and other equity based compensation 
the determination of grant date fair value is estimated using an option pricing model  which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price  the exercise behavior of our employees  interest rates  and dividend yields 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
changes in any of these variables could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for share based payments 
as a result of the option modifications that occurred in connection with the spin off of our research and drug development businesses and the separation of mpi from us  we measured the potential accounting impact of these option modifications as established by sfas r paragraphs and based upon the analysis that included a comparison of the fair value of the modified options granted to our employees immediately after the modification with the fair value of the original option immediately prior to the modification  the company determined there was no incremental compensation expense 
all remaining unrecognized sfas r compensation expense at the time of separation from options granted to mpi employees by the company will be recognized by mpi over the remaining vesting term of the option 
income taxes 
our income tax provision is based on income before taxes and is computed using the liability method in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
table of contents determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates projected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes 
some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  or the expected results from any future tax examinations 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future provision for income taxes 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  the results of any future tax examinations  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  changes in estimates of prior years items  past levels of r d spending  acquisitions  changes in our corporate structure  and changes in overall levels of income before taxes all of which may result in periodic revisions to our provision for income taxes 
uncertain tax positions are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
our deferred tax assets are offset by a full valuation allowance 
the determination of the amount and extent of the valuation allowance offsetting our deferred tax assets requires a substantial degree of judgment 
if we continue to experience positive trends in operating results  this valuation allowance could reverse in part or in full in the near term based on whether or not  in our judgment  it becomes more likely than not that the underlying deferred tax assets will be realized 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued three new fasb staff positions fsps all of which impact the accounting and disclosure related to certain financial instruments 
fsp fas  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly fsp fas provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with sfas no 
when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
it also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
fsp fas and fas  recognition of other than temporary impairment fsp fas and fas amends the other than temporary impairment guidance for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements 
fsp fas and apb interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments fsp fas and apb amends sfas no 
to require disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments on an interim basis in addition to the annual disclosure requirements 
we adopted all three fsps as of april  and they did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows during the year ended june  in may  fasb issued sfas no 
 subsequent events 
this pronouncement establishes standards for accounting for and disclosing subsequent events events which occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
sfas no 
requires an entity to disclose the date through which subsequent events were evaluated and whether that evaluation took place on the date financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
we adopted sfas no 
as of april  and sfas no 
does not impact the company s financial position or results of operation as it is disclosure only in nature 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas no 
will become the source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
on the effective date of this statement  the codification will supersede all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification will become non authoritative 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 

table of contents in february  the fasb issued statement of financial position fsp no 
 which delays the effective date of fas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis items that are re measured at least annually 
the fsp deferred the effective date of fas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities until our fiscal year beginning on july  the adoption of this standard by us is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations years ended june  and molecular diagnostic revenue is comprised primarily of sales of our molecular diagnostic products 
molecular diagnostic revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
sales of bracanalysis account for most of our molecular diagnostic revenues 
this increase in molecular diagnostic revenue is primarily attributable to increased testing volume 
increased sales  marketing  and education efforts resulted in wider acceptance of our products by the medical community and patients and increased testing volumes for the fiscal year ended june  we are currently in the process of expanding our sales force  executing a public awareness marketing campaign  and increasing our market penetration in the us ob gyn market 
through these and other efforts we are attempting to broaden utilization of our products with current physician customers and increase the number of new physician customers prescribing our products 
we believe these efforts will allow us to continue to grow molecular diagnostic revenue in future periods  however  the markets in which we operate are experiencing unprecedented economic turmoil resulting in loss of jobs  loss of employer sponsored insurance coverage  and reduced doctor visits 
we believe that there has been some dampening effect on our revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to these difficult economic times 
in addition  because bracanalysis and most of our molecular diagnostic products are only utilized once per patient  we will need to sell our services through physicians to new patients or develop new molecular diagnostic products in order to continue to generate revenue 
therefore  there can be no assurance that molecular diagnostic revenue will continue to increase at historical rates 
molecular diagnostic cost of revenue is comprised primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  royalty payments  equipment costs and facilities expense 
molecular diagnostic cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of in molecular diagnostic cost of revenue is primarily due to the increase in molecular diagnostic revenues for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
our gross profit margin was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this increase in gross profit margins is primarily attributable to technology improvements and efficiency gains in the operation of our molecular diagnostic laboratory 
there can be no assurance that molecular diagnostic gross profit margins will continue to increase and we expect that our gross profit margins will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the introduction of new products as well as new technologies and operating systems in our molecular diagnostic laboratory 
research and development expenses from continuing operations are comprised primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  and equipment and facility costs 
research and development expenses for continuing operations incurred during the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this decrease of was primarily due to decreased expenses associated with internal research projects of approximately million offset by an increase in share based payment expense of approximately million 
we expect our research and development expenses will increase over the next several years as we work to develop and expand our offerings of molecular diagnostic products 
selling  general and administrative expenses for continuing operations consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel costs for sales  marketing  customer service  billing and collection  executive  legal  finance and accounting  information technology  human resources  and allocated facilities expenses 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of was primarily attributable to increased sales and marketing expense of approximately million to support the growth in our molecular diagnostic revenues  which included the continued expansion of our oncology and ob gyn sales force and our direct to consumer marketing campaign in florida and texas  general increases in administrative support and facility expenses of approximately million to support growth in molecular diagnostic sales and market expansion efforts  general increases in sales support costs of approximately million to support growth in our molecular diagnostic business  an increase of million in bad debt expense associated with increased molecular diagnostic sales  increased share based payment expense of approximately million 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to fluctuate depending on the number and scope of any new product launches and efforts in support of our existing molecular diagnostic products 
interest income for the fiscal year ended june  was million  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was due primarily to lower market interest rates during the fiscal year 
other expense for the fiscal year ended june  increased million from an expense of million for the fiscal year ended june  to million expense for the fiscal year ended june  this increase was primarily attributed to an other than temporary impairment on marketable investment securities 
based on the bankruptcy filing of lehman brothers holdings  inc lehman  we determined that our investment in certain lehman bonds was not likely to be recoverable 
based on this determination  we expensed the full value of all lehman holdings resulting in an other than temporary impairment loss of approximately million 
as noted above under overview  on june   we separated the research and drug development businesses conducted by us and by mpi and spun off mpi to our stockholders 
we do not have any ownership or other form of interest in mpi subsequent to the separation 
as a result of the separation  we have classified the operations from the research and drug development businesses that were conducted by us and mpi until june  as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
during the year ended june   losses from discontinued operations increased by million  from a million loss for the year ended june  to a million loss for the year ended june  the increase is primarily due to the lack of the one time million non refundable upfront fee recognized at june  that partially offset our drug development costs 
on june   we discontinued our development of the alzheimers drug candidate 
years ended june  and molecular diagnostic revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
sales of bracanalysis account for most of our molecular diagnostic revenues 
this increase in molecular diagnostic revenue is primarily attributable to increased testing volume 
increased sales  marketing  and education efforts resulted in wider acceptance of our products by the medical community and increased testing volumes for the fiscal year ended june  molecular diagnostic cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of in molecular diagnostic cost of revenue was primarily due to the increase in molecular diagnostic revenues for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
our gross profit margin was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this increase in gross profit margins was primarily attributable to technology improvements and efficiency gains in the operation of our molecular diagnostic laboratory 

table of contents research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this million increase was due a million increase in development expenses of molecular diagnostic product offerings  and increase of million increase in share based payment expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of was primarily attributable to increased sales and marketing expense of approximately million to support the growth in our molecular diagnostic revenues  which included the expansion of our oncology and ob gyn sales force  as well as commissions  travel  and initiative programs  an increase of million in bad debt expense associated with increased molecular diagnostic sales  an increase of million in marketing expense from our dtc campaign and other marketing efforts  general increases in administrative support and facility expenses of approximately million to support growth molecular diagnostic sales and market expansion efforts  and general increases in back office sales support costs of approximately million to support growth in our molecular diagnostic business  and an increase in share based payment expense of approximately million 
interest income for the fiscal year ended june  was million  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase was due primarily to increases in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities 
other income and expense for the fiscal year ended june  decreased million from income of million for the fiscal year ended june  to million expense for the fiscal year ended june  as a result of losses realized from the disposition of equipment 
as noted above under overview  on june   we separated the research and drug development businesses conducted by us and by mpi and spun off mpi to our stockholders 
we do not have any ownership or other form of interest in mpi subsequent to the separation 
as a result of the separation  we have classified the operations from the research and drug development businesses that were conducted by us and mpi until june  as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
during the year ended june   the losses from discontinued operations decreased by million from a million loss at june  to a million loss at june  the decrease is primarily due to the recognition of the one time million non refundable upfront fee from a co marketing agreement with lundbeck a s associated with our former alzheimer s disease drug candidate at june  that partially offset our drug development costs 
on june   we discontinued our development of the alzheimers drug candidate 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities decreased million  or  from million at june  to million at june  this decrease is primarily attributable to the contribution of million to mpi in connection with the separation of our former drug development and research businesses from us which was partially offset by an increase of cash generated from continuing operating activities and an increase from proceeds from the exercise of warrants  and the exercise of stock options and sales of our common stock under our equity compensation plans 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the fiscal year ended june  compared to million provided by operating activities during the prior fiscal year 
net trade receivables increased million between june  and june   primarily due to the increase in 
table of contents molecular diagnostic sales during the same period 
accounts payable decreased by million and accrued liabilities decreased by million between june  and june   primarily due to payments made following the discontinuance of our former alzheimer s disease program as well as an million payment for a sublicense fee related to the lundbeck co marketing agreement 
deferred revenue decreased by million between june  and june   primarily due to the completion of research collaborations 
our investing activities used cash of million during the fiscal year ended june  compared to million used in investing activities during the prior fiscal year primarily due to the purchase of marketable investment securities during the year 
for the fiscal year ended june   purchases of marketable investment securities used cash of million  maturities of marketable investment securities provided cash of million  and capital expenditures for research equipment used cash of million 
financing activities used cash of million during the fiscal year ended june  and provided cash of million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in cash from financing activities is attributed primarily to the transfer of million in cash and cash equivalents to mpi part of a total transfer of million in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities in connection with the separation of our former drug development and research businesses 
this was offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of our common stock from our equity compensation plans 
another factor that will affect our liquidity and capital recourses relates to our deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets are offset by a full valuation allowance of approximately million at june  if we continue to experience positive trends in operating results  this valuation allowance could reverse in part or in full in the near term based on whether or not  in our judgment  it becomes more likely than not that the underlying deferred tax assets will be realized 
when this occurs  the reversal of the valuation allowance of million will offset tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations and the remaining million related to excess tax benefits related to stock options will be recognized as additional paid in capital 
we believe that with our existing capital resources and expected net cash to be generated from sales of our molecular diagnostic products  we will have adequate funds to maintain our current and planned operations for at least the next two years  although no assurance can be given that changes will not occur that would consume available capital resources before such time and we may need or want to raise additional financing within this period of time 
our future capital requirements  cash flows  and results of operations could be affected by and will depend on many factors that are currently unknown to us  including termination of the licenses underlying our molecular diagnostic products  delays or other problems with operating our laboratory facilities  public concern over our approved products and any product candidates  failure to sustain revenue growth or margins in our molecular diagnostic business  the costs and expenses incurred in supporting our existing molecular diagnostic products  the progress  results and cost of developing additional molecular diagnostic products for our molecular diagnostic business  the costs  timing and results of launching new molecular diagnostic products  the costs  timing and outcome of any regulatory review of our existing or future molecular diagnostic products  the costs of preparing  filing and prosecuting patent applications  maintaining and enforcing our issued patents and defending intellectual property related claims  the costs  timing and outcome of any litigation against us associated with any of our current or future products  
table of contents introduction of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  regulatory developments or enforcement in the united states and foreign countries  changes in structure of healthcare payment systems  the impact of current economic conditions and job loss resulting in fewer doctor visits and loss of employer provided insurance coverage  our ability to enter into strategic collaborations  licensing or other arrangements favorable to us  and the costs to satisfy our obligations under our existing and potential future collaborations 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations the following table represents our consolidated contractual obligations as of june  in thousands total less than one year years years more than years operating leases purchase obligations total the expected timing of payment for the obligations listed above is estimated based on current information 
actual payment timing and amounts may differ depending on the timing of goods or services received or other changes 
the table above only includes payment obligations that are fixed or determinable 
the table excludes royalties to third parties based on future sales of any of our product candidates that are approved for sale  as the amounts  timing  and likelihood of any such payments are based on the level of future sales of products and are unknown 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business  revenues  or operating results during the periods presented 
certain factors that may affect future results of operations the securities and exchange commission encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand a company s future prospects and make informed investment decisions 
this annual report on form k contains such forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of words such as may  anticipate  estimate  expects  projects  intends  plans  believes and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance  identify forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements are management s present expectations of future events and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those described in the forward looking statements 
these risks include  but are not limited to the risk that sales and profit margins of our existing molecular diagnostic products may decline or will not continue to increase at historical rates  the risk that we may be unable to develop additional molecular diagnostic products  the risk that licenses to the technology underlying our molecular diagnostic

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our written investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments consist of securities of various types and maturities of three years or less  with a maximum average maturity of months 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
realized gains and losses on investment security transactions are reported on the specific identification method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
although our investment policy guidelines are intended to ensure the preservation of principal  current market conditions have resulted in high levels of uncertainty 
our ability to trade or redeem the marketable investment securities in which we invest  including certain corporate bonds and auction rate securities  has become difficult 
valuation and pricing of these securities has also become variable and subject to uncertainty 
as of june  we have estimated unrealized gains of million in our investment portfolio 
for the year ended june  we have experienced fluctuations in our portfolio value primarily from our investments in bonds of financial institutions 
we also recorded a million other than temporary impairment on marketable investment securities issued by lehman brothers 
however  the ultimate value that we realize from our marketable investment securities may change substantially 
the securities held in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect the fair market value of the marketable investment securities 
after a review of our marketable securities as of june  and  we have determined that in the event of a hypothetical increase in interest rates  the resulting decrease in fair market value of our marketable investment securities would be immaterial to the consolidated financial statements as a whole
