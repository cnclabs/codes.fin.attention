management s discussion and analysis is presented in the following order overview revenues and expenses results of operations liquidity and capital resources material off balance sheet arrangements critical accounting policies overview we develop medical imaging and information management software and deliver related services 
we have reorganized and renamed our operating business units  effective july  the relevant portions of the emea formerly known as merge europe  middle east and africa operation  which sells to the end user healthcare market in europe  the middle east and africa  has been allocated between the merge fusion formerly known as merge healthcare north america and merge oem formerly known as cedara business units 
merge oem primarily sells software products  developer toolkits and custom engineering services to oem s and var s world wide 
these customers develop  manufacture or resell medical imaging software or devices 
merge fusion primarily sells directly to the end user healthcare market consisting of hospitals  imaging centers and specialty clinics located in the us  canada and europe  the middle east and africa and also distributes certain products through the internet via our website 
healthcare providers continue to be challenged by declining reimbursements  competition and reduced operating profits brought about by the increasing costs of delivering healthcare services 
in the us  we are focusing our merge fusion sales efforts on single and multi site imaging centers that complete more than  studies per year  small to medium sized hospitals fewer than beds  and certain specialty clinics  such as orthopaedic practices  that offer imaging services 
we have aggressively expanded our product offerings through various acquisitions 
on june   we completed a private placement of our common stock pursuant to which we raised net proceeds of million million less issuance costs of million and prepaid interest for two quarters totaling million through a securities purchase agreement with merrick  an affiliate of merrick ventures  which was executed on may  as a result of the financing  the reorganization of our operating business units  the two restructuring initiatives completed in february and june  and our operating results for the last two quarters of  we believe that we now have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs going forward 
revenues and expenses the following is a brief discussion of our revenues and expenses net sales net sales consist of software and other sales  net of estimated returns and allowances  and professional services and maintenance 
software and other sales consist of software and purchased component revenue recognized in sales to oem customers  healthcare facilities and imaging centers 
professional services and maintenance consists of installation  custom engineering services  training  consulting  and software maintenance and support 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of purchased components  third party royalties  costs to service and support our customers and amortization of patents and purchased and developed software  including related impairments 
the cost of software and other includes purchased components and third party royalties included in software and hardware sales to our customers 
the cost of services and maintenance includes headcount and related costs incurred in our performance of installation  custom engineering services  training  consulting and software maintenance and support 
purchased and developed software is amortized over its estimated useful life 
each quarter we test our purchased and developed software for impairment by comparing its fair value estimated using undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the software 
if the carrying value of the software exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment is incurred equal to the amount of the difference between the carrying value and estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense includes the costs of our sales and marketing departments  commissions and costs associated with trade shows 
research and development expense research and development expense consists of expenses incurred for the development of our proprietary software and technologies 
the costs reflected in this category are reduced by software development costs capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
the amortization of capitalized software development costs and any related impairments are included in cost of sales 
during  we did not capitalize any software development costs 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense includes costs for information systems  accounting  administrative support  management personnel  bad debt expense  legal fees and general corporate matters 
goodwill and trade name impairment  restructuring and other expenses goodwill and trade name impairment  restructuring and other expenses consist of impairment of goodwill and trade names see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein  severance to involuntarily terminated employees resulting from our restructuring initiatives  loss on disposal of subsidiaries and impairment of non cancelable building leases associated with restructuring activities 
depreciation  amortization and impairment depreciation and amortization  including any impairment  is assessed on capital equipment  leasehold improvements and our customer relationships intangible asset 
depreciation and amortization are recorded over the respective asset s useful life 
we also record impairment of these long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based primarily upon whether expected future undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to support recovery of the assets 
other income expense other income expense is comprised of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalent balances  interest expense and amortization of costs and discounts incurred from borrowings  foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency payables and receivables at our nuenen  netherlands branch and at our subsidiaries located in mississauga  ontario and shanghai  china 
in addition  we also record any other than temporary impairment charges recognized on our equity investments in non public companies in other income expense

the relevant portions of emea have been allocated between merge oem and merge fusion 
software and other sales 
net software and other sales for were million  a decrease of approximately million  or  from million for the decrease in software and other sales primarily resulted from a million decrease in revenue recognized on software and other sales by our merge fusion business unit  offset by a million increase in our merge oem software and other sales 
the increase in oem software and other sales was primarily due to recognition of software revenue upon delivery of  or relief from delivery of  certain contract elements associated with contracts signed in or earlier 
our merge fusion business unit net sales decreased as a result of the delay of certain product deliverables during the first two quarters of  the disposal of our french subsidiary at the beginning of the second quarter of and the previous uncertainty regarding the status of our remaining operations 
although we believe that the financing transaction completed in june and settlement of the two lawsuits are positive events  it may take time for our customers to fully react  especially in the current economic environment 
in addition  we anticipate that the revenue recognized from software and other sales may vary significantly on a quarter to quarter basis 
service and maintenance sales 
net service and maintenance sales for were million  a decrease of million  or  from million for service and maintenance sales recognized through our merge fusion business unit decreased million  while service and maintenance sales recognized through our merge oem business unit increased million 
the merge fusion sales decrease is a result of a decrease in services to install software products as well as a decrease in renewals of maintenance contracts of certain customers  primarily due to our customers prior viability concerns with respect to us 
our merge oem business unit experienced increased revenue during resulting from an increase in customer contracts involving custom engineering services 
gross margin gross margin software and other sales 
gross margin on software and other sales was million for  an increase of approximately million  or  from million for gross margin as a percentage of software and other sales increased to for from for the increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the mix in sales from our business units and a decrease in amortization expense in sales by our merge oem business unit  which typically consist of software only contracts at higher margins  were of software and other sales during compared to during the decrease in amortization is primarily due to the fact that amortization for included impairment of certain of our purchased and capitalized software projects of million due to significant risk of technological obsolescence associated with certain projects  the majority of which were still in development at the time of impairment  compared to a million impairment on purchased software during there was also a decrease in recurring amortization associated with gross purchased and capitalized software costs in as a result of the impairment charges 
we expect our gross margin on software and other sales going forward to fluctuate depending on the mix of sales between the business units 
gross margin services and maintenance sales 
gross margin on services and maintenance sales was million for  an increase of million  or  from million for gross margin as a percentage of services and maintenance sales increased to for from for the increase was due to the decrease in salaries and other related expenses including travel and entertainment as a result of our restructuring activities during february and june of sales and marketing sales and marketing expense decreased million  or  to million for from million for as a result of ongoing cost reductions previously discussed  including the restructuring initiatives announced in  salaries and consultant fees  commissions and other related expenses including travel and entertainment decreased by million and share based compensation expense decreased by million 
in addition  we incurred million less in direct marketing costs as a result of cash saving efforts 
also  million of the decrease was due to a reduction in sales and marketing expenses at our french subsidiary  which we disposed of in april product research and development product research and development expense decreased million  or  to million for from million for decreased expenses for were primarily attributable to a million reduction in salaries  consultant fees and related expenses including travel and entertainment and a decrease in share based compensation expense of million as a result of our restructuring initiatives in in addition  million of the decrease was due to a reduction in product research and development expenses of our french subsidiary  which we disposed of in april offsetting this decrease was the fact that we did not capitalize any software development costs  which reduce costs in the applicable period  during compared to million of capitalized costs for general and administrative general and administrative expense decreased million  or  to million for from million for decreased expenses were primarily attributable to a million reduction in our salaries and related expenses including travel and entertainment and a share based compensation expense decrease of million as a result of our restructuring initiatives in also  legal  accounting and other professional fees  including the settlement cost of the class action lawsuit and reimbursement of certain fees from our directors and officers liability insurance carrier  decreased million for  due to a decline in activities and costs associated with the settlement of the class action lawsuit and prior restatement of financial statements 
additionally  general and administrative expenses decreased by million for due to a decrease in costs incurred by our french subsidiary  which we disposed of in april  and million due to a decrease in costs associated with our indian subsidiaries  which we disposed of or shut down in the third quarter of goodwill and trade name impairment  restructuring and other expense as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded million of restructuring charges for related to the initiatives announced in february and june in addition  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded a million trade name impairment charge associated with renaming our merge oem business unit

as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  during we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million and a trade name impairment charge of million 
depreciation  amortization and impairment depreciation  amortization and impairment expense decreased million  or  to million for from million for decreased depreciation  amortization and impairment expenses were primarily attributable to a million impairment of customer relationships during as well as a decrease in continuing amortization during as a result of the impairment charge

in  we incurred million of impairment charges on our equity investments and million in foreign exchange losses  offset by million in interest income 
the decrease in interest income for compared to is attributed to a decrease in the average balance of our cash and cash equivalents in compared to as well as a decrease in the yield on cash and cash equivalents 
the foreign exchange gain for was primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar in the fourth quarter of income tax benefit the net income tax benefit of recorded during is primarily attributable to changes in deferred taxes resulting from the impairment of indefinite lived trade names  offset by income and capital gains taxes payable in india which we were not able to offset with either us or canadian losses 
our effective tax rate for the period differed significantly from the statutory rate primarily due to a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets which we have concluded are not more likely than not to be realized 
our effective tax rate of for differed significantly from the statutory rate primarily due to the impairment of nondeductible goodwill and a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized 
our expected effective income tax rate is volatile and may move up or down with changes in  among other items  operating income and changes in tax law and regulations of the us and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate

our merge fusion business unit also experienced decreased bookings and revenue during resulting from our internal delays in the delivery of certain software products and the impact of the dra  which caused some of our customers to respond by reducing their purchases or postponing purchasing decisions

general we believe our current cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to meet our operating  financing and capital requirements through at least the next months 
however  any projections of future cash inflows and outflows are subject to uncertainty 
in the event that it is necessary to raise additional capital to meet our short term or long term liquidity needs  such capital may be raised through additional debt  equity offerings or sale of certain assets 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity related or debt securities  such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
furthermore  because of the low trading price of our common stock  the number of shares of any new equity or equity related securities that may be issued may result in significant dilution to existing shareholders 
in addition  the issuance of debt securities could increase the liquidity risk or perceived liquidity risk that we face 
we cannot  however  be certain that additional financing  or funds from asset sales  will be available on acceptable terms 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we will likely not be able to take advantage of opportunities  develop or enhance services or products or respond to competitive pressures 
any projections of future cash inflows and outflows are subject to uncertainty 
in particular  our uses of cash in and beyond will depend on a variety of factors such as the costs to implement our business strategy  the amount of cash that we are required to devote to defend and address any regulatory proceedings  and potential merger and acquisition activities 
for a more detailed description of risks and uncertainties that may affect our liquidity  see item a  risk factors in this annual report on form k 
material off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates  judgments  and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
we base our estimates and judgments on our experience  our current knowledge including terms of existing contracts  our beliefs of what could occur in the future  our observation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following accounting policies and estimates as those that we believe are most critical to our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties revenue recognition  allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  software capitalization  other long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible asset valuation  investments  share based compensation expense  income taxes  guarantees and loss contingencies 
revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the licensing of software  sales of hardware and related ancillary products  installation  engineering services  training  consulting  and software maintenance and support 
inherent to software revenue recognition are significant management estimates and judgments in the interpretation and practical application of the complex rules to individual contracts 
these interpretations generally would not influence the amount of revenue recognized  but could influence the timing of such revenues 
typically  our contracts contain multiple elements  and while the majority of our contracts contain standard terms and conditions  there are instances where our contracts contain non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition sop no 
 or emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf no 
 and if so  the relative fair value that should be allocated to each of the elements as well as when to recognize revenue for each element 
for software arrangements  we recognize revenue in accordance with sop no 
this generally requires revenue recognized on software arrangements involving multiple elements  including separate arrangements with the same customer executed within a short time frame of each other  to be allocated to each element based on the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair values of those elements 
revenue from multiple element software arrangements is recognized using the residual method  pursuant to sop no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop no 

under the residual method  revenue is recognized in a multiple element arrangement when vsoe of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement  even if vsoe of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
for sales transactions where the software is incidental  the only contract deliverable is custom engineering or installation services  and hardware transactions where no software is involved  we recognize revenue in accordance with eitf issue no 
and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab no 

we allocate revenue to each undelivered element in a multiple element arrangement based on its respective fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
specifically  we determine the fair value of the maintenance portion of an arrangement based on the substantive renewal price of the maintenance offered to customers  which generally is stated in the contract 
the fair value of installation  engineering services  training and consulting is based upon the price charged when these services are sold separately 
if evidence of the fair value cannot be established for undelivered elements of a sale  the entire amount of revenue under the arrangement is deferred until elements without vsoe of fair value have been delivered or vsoe of fair value can be established 
if evidence of fair value cannot be established for the maintenance element of a sale  and it represents the only undelivered element  all elements of the sale are deferred and recognized ratably over the related maintenance period 
revenue from software licenses sold to end users and var s is recognized upon shipment  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
we assess collectability based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we must exercise our judgment when we assess the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  it could affect the timing and the amount of revenue we recognize on a contract 
in addition  in certain transactions prior to  we negotiated with customers a provision that included our receipt of ownership in the customer s common stock ownership as part of the sale 
we generally do not request collateral from customers 
revenue from software licenses sold via certain term based contracts that include software maintenance and support is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period as vsoe of fair value for maintenance generally does not exist 
revenue from installation  engineering services  training and consulting services is recognized as services are performed 
revenue from sales of ris  ris pacs solution  and other specific arrangements where professional services are considered essential to the functionality of the solution sold  is recognized on the percentage of completion method  as prescribed by sop no 
 accounting for performance on construction type and certain production type contracts 
percentage of completion is determined by the input method based upon the amount of labor hours expended compared to the total labor hours expended plus the estimated amount of labor hours to complete the project 
total estimated labor hours are based on management s best estimate of the total amount of time it will take to complete a project 
these estimates require the use of judgment 
a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts 
we review our contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated labor hours and reflect changes in estimates in the period that such estimates are revised under the cumulative catch up method 
at times  we have had difficulty accurately estimating the number of days required to complete the consulting and installation services and  accordingly  accurately estimating the percentages of completion 
our oem software products are typically fully functional upon delivery and do not require significant modification or alteration 
fees for services provided to oem customers are billed separately from licenses of our software products 
for sales transactions involving only the delivery of custom engineering services  we recognize revenue under proportional performance guidelines of sab no 
for sales including significant custom engineering services and software products  revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
deferred revenue is comprised of deferrals for license fees  support and maintenance and other services 
long term deferred revenue as of december   represents license fees  support and maintenance and other services to be earned or provided after january  we record reimbursable out of pocket expenses in both services and maintenance net sales and as a direct cost of services and maintenance in accordance with eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees  the reimbursement by customers of shipping and handling costs are recorded in software and other net sales and the associated cost as a cost of sale 
we account for sales taxes on a net basis in accordance with eitf no 
 how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns based upon past experience and judgment  we establish allowances for doubtful accounts with respect to our accounts receivable and sales returns 
we determine collection risk and record allowances for bad debts based on the aging of accounts and past transaction history with customers 
in addition  our policy is to allow sales returns when we have preauthorized the return 
based on our historical experience of returns and customer credits  we have determined an allowance for estimated returns and credits in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when the right of return exists 
we monitor our collections  write offs  returns and credit experience to assess whether adjustments to our allowance estimates are necessary 
changes in trends in any of the factors that we believe impact the realizability of our receivables or modifications to our credit standards  collection  return and credit  authorization practices or other related policies may impact our estimates 
software capitalization software capitalization commences when we determine that projects have achieved technological feasibility  unless the costs expected to be incurred after achieving technological feasibility until general release are immaterial 
our determination that a project has achieved technological feasibility does not ensure that the project can be commercially salable as a product 
amounts capitalized include direct labor and estimates of overhead attributable to the projects 
the useful lives of purchased software and capitalized software are assigned by management  based upon the expected life of the software 
we also estimate the realizability of purchased and capitalized values based on undiscounted projections of future net operating cash flows through the sale of the respective products 
if we determine in the future that the value of purchased or capitalized software cannot be recovered  a write down of the value of the software to its recoverable value may be required 
if the actual achieved revenues are lower than our estimates or the useful life of a product is shorter than the estimated useful life  the asset may be deemed to be impaired  and  accordingly  a write down of the value of the asset or a shorter amortization period may be required 
other long lived assets other long lived assets  including patents  property and equipment and customer relationships  are amortized over their expected lives  which are estimated by us 
we also make estimates of the impairment of these long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based primarily upon whether expected future undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to support recovery of the asset 
if the actual useful life of a long lived asset is shorter than the useful life estimated by us  the asset may be deemed to be impaired  and  accordingly  a write down of the value of the asset  generally determined by a discounted cash flow analysis  or a shorter depreciation or amortization period  may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
our policy provides that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be reviewed for impairment as of december of each year 
in calculating potential impairment losses  we evaluate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets using either quoted market prices or  if not available  by estimating the expected present value of their future cash flows 
identification of  and assignment of assets and liabilities to  a reporting unit require our judgment and estimates 
in addition  future cash flows are based upon our assumptions about future sales activity and market acceptance of our products 
if these assumptions change  we may be required to write down the carrying value of the asset to a revised amount 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment of goodwill or trade names in the years ended december   and investments on january   we adopted the methods of fair value as described in sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
to value our financial assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
at december   we held certain securities in a publicly traded entity and private companies which are classified as non current assets and are considered financial assets within the guidelines of sfas no 
in determining fair value  we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible 
the investment in the publicly traded equity security  over which we do not exert significant influence  is classified as available for sale and reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses utilizing level inputs are based on changes in quoted market prices and reported within the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity 
the investments in equity securities of private companies  over which we do not exert significant influence  are reported at cost or fair value utilizing level inputs  if an other than temporary loss has been determined 
in calculating potential impairment losses  we evaluate the fair value of investments by comparing them to certain public company metrics  such as revenue multiples  information obtained from independent valuations  and inquiries and estimates made by us 
if assumptions or estimates used by us change  we may be required to write down the carrying value of the asset to a revised amount 
any loss due to impairment in value is recorded when such loss occurs 
share based compensation expense we use the modified prospective transition method of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which we adopted on january   to account for share based awards previously we accounted for such costs under apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this transition method  compensation cost includes compensation cost for all share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and compensation cost for all share based awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant utilizing certain assumptions including expected volatility  which we base on the historical volatility of our stock and other factors  and estimated option life  which represents the period of time the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based  in part  on historical data 
we also estimate employee terminations option forfeiture rate  which is based  in part  on historical data 
although we believe our assumptions used to calculate share based compensation expense are reasonable  these assumptions can involve complex judgments about future events  which are open to interpretation and inherent uncertainty 
in addition  significant changes to our assumptions could significantly impact the amount of expense recorded in a given period 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
on january   we adopted fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 

this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the pronouncement also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
pursuant to fin no 
 we record as noncurrent any unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to be paid within one year 
in may  the fasb issued staff position fin no 
 definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 
fsp fin no 
which amended fin no 
to provide guidance about how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits 
under fsp fin no 
 a tax position could be effectively settled through an examination by a taxing authority 
since adoption  we have applied fin no 
in a manner consistent with the provisions of fsp fin no 
the provision for income taxes is determined in accordance with sfas no 
a current liability is recognized for the estimated taxes payable for the current year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the timing differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates or tax laws are recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized 
changes in valuation allowances will flow through the statement of operations unless related to deferred tax assets that expire unutilized or are modified through translation  in which case both the deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance are similarly adjusted 
where a valuation allowance was established through purchase accounting for acquired deferred tax assets  any future change outside the measurement period will be credited or charged to income tax expense under sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
in spite of our belief that we have appropriate support for all the positions taken on our tax returns  we acknowledge that certain positions may be successfully challenged by the taxing authorities 
we apply the provisions of fin no 
to determine the appropriate amount of tax benefits to be recognized with respect to uncertain tax positions 
unrecognized tax benefits are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based upon new information  resolution with taxing authorities and expiration of the statute of limitations 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of changes in the fin no 
liability 
although we believe our recorded tax assets and liabilities are reasonable  tax laws and regulations are subject to interpretation and inherent uncertainty  therefore  our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely on estimates and assumptions 
although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable  the final determination could be materially different than that which is reflected in our provision for income taxes and recorded tax assets and liabilities 
guarantees in accordance with fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin no 
 we recognize the fair value of guarantee and indemnification arrangements issued or modified by us  if these arrangements are within the scope of the interpretation 
in addition  we must continue to monitor the conditions that are subject to the guarantees and indemnifications  as required under the previously existing generally accepted accounting principles  in order to identify if a loss has occurred 
if we determine it is probable that a loss has occurred  then any such estimable loss would be recognized under those guarantees and indemnifications 
under our standard software license  services and maintenance agreement  we agree to indemnify  defend and hold harmless our licensees from and against certain losses  damages and costs arising from claims alleging the licensees use of our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
historically  we have not been required to pay material amounts in connection with claims asserted under these provisions  and  accordingly  we have not recorded a liability relating to such provisions 
under our software license  services and maintenance agreement  we also represent and warrant to licensees that our software products will operate substantially in accordance with published specifications  and that the services we perform will be undertaken by qualified personnel in a professional manner conforming to generally accepted industry standards and practices 
historically  only minimal costs have been incurred relating to the satisfaction of product warranty claims 
other guarantees include promises to indemnify  defend and hold harmless each of our executive officers  non employee directors and certain key employees from and against losses  damages and costs incurred by each such individual in administrative  legal or investigative proceedings arising from alleged wrongdoing by the individual while acting in good faith within the scope of his or her job duties on our behalf 
merge and certain of our former officers are defendants in several lawsuits 
these lawsuits and other legal matters in which we have become involved are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have accrued for indemnification costs as of december  for certain of our former officers for their expenses in connection with such matters and may be required to accrue for additional guarantee related costs in future periods 
loss contingencies we have accrued for costs as of december  and may  in the future  accrue for costs associated with certain contingencies  including  but not limited to settlement of legal proceedings and regulatory compliance matters  when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
liabilities established to provide for contingencies are adjusted as further information develops  circumstances change  or contingencies are resolved 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
this statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option is elected would be reported in earnings 
we have adopted sfas no 
and have elected not to measure any additional financial instruments and other items at fair value 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
r which replaces sfas no 
 business combinations  and applies to all transactions or other events in which an entity obtains control of one or more businesses 
sfas no 
r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and requires the acquirer to disclose additional information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
in addition  under sfas no 
r  changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties in a business combination after the measurement period will impact income tax expense 
sfas no 
r is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after december  and may not be applied before that date 
the impact of sfas no 
r on our financial position and results of operations will be dependent upon the extent to which we have transactions or events occur that are within its scope 
in february  fasb issued staff position fas which provides for a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
for non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
we are evaluating the impact of sfas no 
as it relates to our financial position and results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand the effects on an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
it is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we expect to adopt sfas no 
and its required disclosures  in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year beginning january  in april  the fasb issued fsp fas no 
 determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp no 

fsp no 
amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
the intent of fsp no 
is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas no 
r  and other us generally accepted accounting principles 
fsp no 
is effective for our interim and annual financial statements beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of fsp no 
will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued fsp fas no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp no 
fsp no 
clarified the application of sfas no 
fsp no 
demonstrated how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive 
fsp no 
was effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued 
the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates  which may affect our interest income 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents included money market funds and short term deposits  including certain cash that is restricted  totaling approximately million  and earned interest at a weighted average rate of during the value of the principal amounts is equal to the fair value for these instruments 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  our interest income is subject to changes in short term interest rates 
at current investment levels  our pre tax results of operations would vary by approximately million for every basis point change in our weighted average short term interest rate 
we do not use our portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk we have sales and expenses in canada  china and europe that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and  as a result  have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
prior to  we periodically entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases to levels that we do not deem acceptable  we may choose to hedge those exposures
