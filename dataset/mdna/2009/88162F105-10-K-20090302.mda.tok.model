item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion is intended to analyze major elements of our consolidated financial statements and provide insight into important areas of management s focus 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
we have accounted for the discontinuance or disposal of certain businesses as discontinued operations and have adjusted prior period financial information to exclude these businesses from continuing operations 
statements in the following discussion may include forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
see item a 
risk factors  for additional discussion of these factors and risks 
business overview the changing global economic environment  particularly as it has affected the oil and gas industry  has created an uncertainty that threatens to interrupt a period of unprecedented growth for our company 
during the year ended december   and for the seventh consecutive year  our consolidated revenues increased over the prior year period  reflecting the increasing demand for our products and services during this period  and the execution of our growth strategy  both through internal expansion and acquisitions 
much of the increase in the general demand for energy services during this period was in response to escalating oil and natural gas pricing  caused by the increased energy demands of a growing global economy 
while we continue to pursue growth  the impact of decreased oil and natural gas prices and uncertain capital markets caused by the current global financial crisis has now decreased the demand for many of our products and services 
this has caused us to temper our growth strategy by implementing more conservative fiscal disciplines  such as lower growth expectations  operating and administrative cost reductions  more careful spending on capital projects  consideration of alternative sources of capital  and a more focused effort on using excess cash flow to reduce our long term debt whenever possible 
during  and particularly subsequent to the third quarter hurricanes which interrupted a large portion of maritech s production cash flows  our long term debt balance grew to million  resulting in a debt to total capital ratio of as of december  subsequent to yearend  and as of february   this long term debt balance has increased to million and is not expected to significantly decrease until key capital expenditure projects in progress are completed 
the most significant capital project is the construction of a new calcium chloride plant in el dorado  arkansas  which is expected to be completed and begin operations in the fourth quarter of carefully managing our long term debt levels and our growing asset retirement and decommissioning liabilities  while facing potentially weakening overall operating cash flows  are key strategies during this period of economic uncertainty  the duration of which appears to be indefinite 
despite reporting overall increased consolidated revenues during compared to  our profitability was negatively affected by several events and accounting adjustments recorded during the year 
our maritech segment was severely affected by hurricanes during the third quarter of  which resulted in a significant portion of its producing properties being shut in during the last several months of the year 
maritech also was directly impacted by the significant decrease in oil and natural gas prices experienced during the last half of  which largely contributed to million of oil and gas property impairments recognized in these decreased oil and natural gas prices are expected to continue during  affecting the profitability of maritech and indirectly affecting each of our other reporting segments as well 
our fluids division showed significant operating growth during  with improved gross profit as a result of lower costs for its cbf products and increased completion service margins 
our offshore services segment formerly known as our well abandonment decommissioning services segment showed minimally improved performance  as lower capacity and poor operating weather conditions during much of the year were offset by the strong performance late in the year of its contract diving operation  which is capitalizing on the post hurricane market demand for its services 
the performances of our fluids and offshore services segments were offset  however  by the impairments of goodwill and other long term assets  which resulted in each segment reporting decreased pretax earnings compared to the prior year 
our production enhancement division  consisting of our production testing segment and compressco segment  reported continuing growth in earnings compared to the prior year  as each of these businesses continued to expand their operations during most of the year 
corporate overhead decreased during compared to as growth in overall administrative expenses were more than offset by gains recorded to other income associated with certain commodity derivative contracts during the fourth quarter of future demand for our products and services depends primarily on activity in the oil and gas exploration and production industry  which is significantly affected by that industry s level of expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and gas reserves and for the plugging and decommissioning of abandoned oil and gas properties 
industry expenditures  as indicated by rig count statistics and other measures  have decreased significantly recently in response to lower oil and natural gas pricing and the general uncertainty regarding availability of capital resources in the current economic environment 
our overall growth is hampered by the current decreased industry demand for our products and services  although we still believe that there are growth opportunities for our products and services in the us and international markets  supported primarily by increases in technologically driven deepwater gas well completions in the gulf of mexico  continued reservoir depletion in the us  advancing age of offshore platforms in the gulf of mexico  and increasing development of oil and gas reserves abroad 
our fluids division generates revenues and cash flows by manufacturing and selling completion fluids and providing filtration  water transfer  and associated products and engineering services to domestic and international exploration and production companies 
in addition  the fluids division also provides liquid and dry calcium chloride products manufactured at its production facilities or purchased from third party suppliers to a variety of markets outside the energy industry 
fluids division revenues increased during compared to the prior year due primarily to increased prices and service activity 
the overall outlook for the division s completion services business is dependent on the level of oil and gas drilling activity  particularly in the gulf of mexico  which has remained flat or has decreased during the past several years  due largely to the maturity of the producing fields in the heavily developed portions of the gulf of mexico 
more recently  overall industry drilling activity has also been acutely impacted by the current decreased oil and natural gas prices and increased capital constraints as a result of the general economic conditions 
potentially offsetting some of this decline  the division is attempting to capitalize on the current industry trend toward drilling deepwater wells that generally require greater volumes of more expensive brine solutions 
in addition  we are also pursuing specific international opportunities where demand for our fluids division products has been more stable 
during  the fluids division entered into a long term contract with petroleo brasileiro sa petrobras to provide completion fluids for its deepwater drilling program offshore brazil 
to further the growth of the division s manufactured products operation and provide additional internally produced supply for our completion fluids operations  in we began construction of a new calcium chloride plant facility located in el dorado  arkansas 
the plant is expected to increase the division s capacity for providing calcium chloride to its customers  generating revenues and cash flows beginning in the fourth quarter of our offshore division consists of two operating segments the offshore services segment and maritech segment 
offshore services generates revenues and cash flows by performing downhole and sub sea services such as plugging and abandonment  workover  inland water drilling  and wireline services  construction and decommissioning services  including hurricane remediation  and diving services involving conventional and saturated air diving 
the services provided by the offshore services segment are marketed primarily in the gulf coast region of the us  including offshore  inland waters and in certain onshore locations 
gulf of mexico platform decommissioning and well abandonment activity levels are driven primarily by mms regulations  the age of producing fields  production platforms and other structures  oil and natural gas commodity prices  sales activity of mature oil and gas producing properties  and overall oil and gas company activity levels 
in addition  the segment intends to capitalize on the current demand for well abandonment and decommissioning activity in the gulf of mexico  including a portion of the work to be performed over the next several years on offshore properties that were damaged or destroyed by the significant hurricanes that occurred in and given the increasing cost to insure offshore properties  many oil and gas operators are accelerating their plans to abandon and decommission their offshore wells and platforms 
offshore services revenues decreased by during  primarily associated with the heavy lift capacity from vessels which we leased during portions of and due to decreased activity levels for well abandonment and decommissioning services  a portion of which was due to unfavorable weather during much of the year 
this decrease was despite a significant increase in dive services activity  particularly following the hurricanes 
despite this increase in demand for dive services  the division expects overall activity to further decrease in due to lower oil and natural gas prices 
through maritech and its subsidiaries  the division acquires  manages  explores  and exploits oil and gas properties in the offshore  inland water and onshore region of the gulf of mexico and generates revenues and cash flows from the sale of the associated oil and natural gas production volumes 
maritech acquires properties for their exploration and development potential  although many of maritech s producing properties were also purchased to support the division s offshore services businesses 
during  maritech s operations were hampered by several factors that will continue to impact its operations going forward  including production interruptions from hurricanes  decreasing oil and natural gas pricing  increased insurance and other operating costs  reduced funding for capital expenditures  and significant future well intervention and decommissioning efforts 
following the hurricanes  maritech now has six toppled offshore platforms that will require extensive efforts to decommission 
maritech continues to assess the remaining well intervention and debris removal efforts associated with these six offshore platforms and continues to believe that substantially all such hurricane related costs incurred and to be incurred in excess of deductibles are covered costs pursuant to its insurance policies 
maritech s revenues during decreased by compared to  despite significantly increased realized oil and natural gas prices during much of the year  due primarily to the decreased overall production following the third quarter hurricanes 
although much of the storm interrupted production has been restored or will be restored by the end of the first quarter of  one of the destroyed offshore platforms served a key producing field  the east cameron field 
the complete restoration of east cameron production will require the redrilling of new wells  and this effort is not expected to be complete until maritech s twenty one primary term leases  along with exploitation opportunities on producing leases  should continue to provide maritech with additional attractive exploitation projects  subject to capital expenditure constraints as a result of the current economic environment 
our production enhancement division consists of two operating segments the production testing segment and compressco segment 
the production testing segment generates revenues and cash flows by performing flowback pressure  volume testing  and other services for oil and gas producers 
the primary testing markets served are in texas  new mexico  colorado  oklahoma  arkansas  louisiana  pennsylvania  the us gulf of mexico  mexico  and certain other international markets 
the division s production testing operations are generally driven by the demand for natural gas and oil and the resulting industry drilling and completion activities in the markets which the production testing segment serves 
the production testing segment revenues increased in as compared to  primarily due to increased domestic demand 
given the current and expected decreased oil and natural gas price environment  we expect demand for our production testing services will decrease in compared to in addition  many of our production testing customers are smaller independent operators  who may be more severely impacted by the current economic uncertainty than larger operators 
compressco generates revenues and cash flows by performing wellhead compression based production enhancement services which it markets throughout states that encompass most of the onshore producing regions of the united states  as well as in canada  mexico  and other international locations 
demand for wellhead compression services is generally driven by the need to boost production in certain mature gas wells with declining production 
the compressco segment s revenues increased in as compared to due to increased domestic and international demand for production enhancement services 
though demand for compressco s services is also affected by oil and natural gas prices  we anticipate compressco s revenues and cash flows to be impacted less than our other businesses  as we continue to seek new domestic and international markets for compressco operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates  and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments  including those related to potential impairments of long lived assets including goodwill  the collectibility of accounts receivable  and the current cost of future abandonment and decommissioning obligations 
note b summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on future expectations  which we believe are reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for judgments made about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these judgments and estimates may change as new events occur  as new information is acquired  and as changes in our operating environment are encountered 
actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates  and those differences may be material 
the following critical accounting policies reflect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the determination of impairment of long lived assets is conducted periodically whenever indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the determination of the amount of impairment is based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
if an impairment of a long lived asset is warranted  we estimate the fair value of the asset  based on a present value of these cash flows or the value that could be realized from disposing of the asset in a transaction between market participants 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical  and our estimates of the amount of future cash flows  the period over which these estimated future cash flows will be generated  as well as the fair value of an impaired asset  are imprecise 
our failure to accurately estimate these future operating cash flows or fair values could result in certain long lived assets being overstated  which could result in impairment charges in periods subsequent to the time in which the impairment indicators were first present 
alternatively  if our estimates of future operating cash flows or fair values are understated  impairments might be recognized unnecessarily or in excess of the appropriate amounts 
our estimates of operating cash flows and fair values for assets impaired have generally been accurate 
although we have historically had minimal impairments of long lived assets other than for oil and gas properties see separate discussion below  during we recorded long lived asset impairments of million 
given the current volatile economic environment  the likelihood of material impairments of long lived assets in future periods is higher due to the possibility of further decreased demand for our products and services 
impairment of goodwill the impairment of goodwill is also assessed whenever impairment indicators are present but no less than once annually 
the assessment for goodwill impairment is performed for each reporting unit  and consists of a comparison of the carrying amount of each reporting unit to our estimation of the fair value of that reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  an impairment loss is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill to our estimated implied fair value of that goodwill 
our estimates of reporting unit fair value are imprecise and are subject to our estimates of the future cash flows of each business and our judgment as to how these estimated cash flows translate into each business estimated fair value 
these estimates and judgments are affected by numerous factors  including the general economic environment at the time of our assessment  which affects our overall market capitalization 
if we over estimate the fair value of our reporting units  the balance of our goodwill asset may be overstated 
alternatively  if our estimated reporting unit fair values are understated  impairments might be recognized unnecessarily or in excess of the appropriate amounts 
during the fourth quarter of  due to changes in the global economic environment which affected our stock price and market capitalization  we recorded an impairment of goodwill of million 
we feel our estimates of the fair value for each reporting unit are reasonable 
however  given the current volatile economic environment  the likelihood of additional material impairments of goodwill in future periods is higher 
oil and gas properties maritech accounts for its interests in oil and gas properties using the successful efforts method  whereby costs incurred to drill and equip development wells  including unsuccessful development wells  are capitalized  and costs related to unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed as incurred 
all capitalized costs are accumulated and recorded separately for each field and are depleted on a unit of production basis  based on the estimated remaining proved oil and gas reserves of each field 
oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment in value on an individual field basis  whenever indicators become evident  with any impairment charged to expense 
accordingly  maritech s results of operations may be more volatile compared to those oil and gas exploration and production companies who account for their operations using the full cost method 
due to the impact of changing oil and gas prices  results of drilling and development efforts  and increased estimated decommissioning liabilities see discussion below  maritech has recorded oil and gas property impairments and dry hole costs  and during the fourth quarter of and the third and fourth quarters of these impairment charges were significant 
maritech purchases oil and gas properties and assumes the associated well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities 
any significant differences in the actual amounts of oil and gas production cash flows produced or decommissioning costs incurred  compared to the estimated amounts recorded  will affect our anticipated profitability 
given the current volatility of oil and natural gas prices  we are more likely to record additional significant impairments in future periods 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering  and economic data for each reservoir 
as a result  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  cash flows  development expenditures  operating and abandonment expenses  and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those initially estimated by maritech 
any significant variance in these assumptions could result in significant upward or downward revisions of previous estimates  as reflected in our annual disclosure of the estimated quantity and value of our proved reserves 
in previous years  we have reflected revisions to our previous estimates of reserve quantities and values  and in some years  these revisions have been significant 
it is possible we will have additional revisions to our estimated quantities of proved reserves in future periods 
decommissioning liabilities we estimate the third party market values including an estimated profit to plug and abandon the wells  decommission the pipelines and platforms and clear the sites  and use these estimates to record maritech s well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities 
these well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities referred to as decommissioning liabilities are recorded net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners  anticipated insurance recoveries  and any contractual amounts to be paid by the previous owners of the property 
in estimating the decommissioning liabilities  we perform detailed estimating procedures  analysis  and engineering studies 
whenever practical  maritech utilizes the services of its affiliated companies to perform well abandonment and decommissioning work 
when these services are performed by an affiliated company  all recorded intercompany revenues are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
any profit we earn in performing such abandonment and decommissioning operations on maritech s properties is recorded as the work is performed 
the recorded decommissioning liability associated with a specific property is fully extinguished when the property is completely abandoned 
once a maritech well abandonment and decommissioning project is performed  any remaining decommissioning liability in excess of the actual cost of the work performed is recorded as additional profit on the project and included in earnings in the period in which the project is completed 
conversely  actual costs in excess of the decommissioning liability are charged against earnings in the period in which the work is performed 
we review the adequacy of our decommissioning liability whenever indicators suggest that either the amount or timing of the estimated cash flows underlying the liability have changed materially 
the estimated timing of these cash flows is determined by the productive life of the associated oil and gas property  which is based on the property s oil and gas reserve estimates 
the amount of cash flows necessary to abandon and decommission the property is subject to changes due to seasonal demand  increased demand following hurricanes  and other general changes in the energy industry environment 
accordingly  the estimation of our decommissioning liability is imprecise 
the estimation of the decommissioning liability associated with the six maritech offshore platforms that were destroyed during the and hurricanes is particularly difficult due to the non routine nature of the efforts required 
the actual cost of performing maritech s well abandonment and decommissioning work has often exceeded our initial estimate of maritech s decommissioning liability and has resulted in charges to earnings in the period the work is performed or when the additional liability is recorded 
to the extent our decommissioning liability is understated  additional charges to earnings may be required in future periods 
revenue recognition we generate revenue on certain well abandonment and decommissioning projects under contracts which are typically of short duration and that provide for either lump sum turnkey charges or specific time  material  and equipment charges  which are billed in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
with regard to turnkey contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
the estimation of total costs to be incurred may be imprecise due to unexpected well conditions  delays  weather  and other uncertainties 
inaccurate cost estimates may result in the revenue associated with a specific contract being recognized in an inappropriate period 
total project revenue and cost estimates for turnkey contracts are reviewed periodically as work progresses  and adjustments are reflected in the period in which such estimates are revised 
provisions for estimated losses on such contracts are made in the period such losses are determined 
despite the uncertainties associated with estimating the total contract cost  our recognition of revenue associated with these contracts has historically been reasonable 
bad debt reserves reserves for bad debts are calculated on a specific identification basis  whereby we estimate whether or not specific accounts receivable will be collected 
such estimates of future collectability may be incorrect  which could result in the recognition of unanticipated bad debt expenses in future periods 
a significant portion of our revenues come from oil and gas exploration and production companies  and historically our estimates of uncollectible receivables have proven reasonably accurate 
however  if due to adverse circumstances  such as in the current economic environment  certain customers are unable to repay some or all of the amounts owed us  an additional bad debt allowance may be required  and such amount may be material 
income taxes we provide for income taxes by taking into account the differences between the financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis amounts 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations and many of these estimates of future operations may be imprecise 
changes in state  federal  and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition  could affect these estimates 
in addition  we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating income tax uncertainties 
these factors include an evaluation of the technical merits of the tax position as well as the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement 
the actual resolution of those uncertainties will inevitably differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
our estimates and judgments associated with our calculations of income taxes have been reasonable in the past  however  the possibility for changes in the tax laws  as well as the current economic uncertainty  could affect the accuracy of our income tax estimates in future periods 
acquisition purchase price allocations we account for acquisitions of businesses using the purchase method  which requires the allocation of the purchase price based on the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired 
we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired using accepted valuation methods  and  in many cases  such estimates are based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows expected to be generated from the acquired assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
we have completed several acquisitions during the past several years and have accounted for the various assets including intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on our estimate of fair values 
goodwill represents the excess of acquisition purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired 
our estimates and judgments of the fair value of acquired businesses are imprecise  and the use of inaccurate fair value estimates could result in the improper allocation of the acquisition purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities  which could result in asset impairments  recording of previously unrecorded liabilities  and other financial statement adjustments 
the difficulty in estimating the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities is increased during periods of economic uncertainty 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas r  share based payment sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost recognized includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
as amended  accounting for share based compensation sfas no 
and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted beginning january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
we estimate the fair value of share based payments of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model requires a number of assumptions  of which the most significant are expected stock price volatility  the expected pre vesting forfeiture rate  and the expected option term the amount of time from the grant date until the options are exercised or expire 
expected volatility is calculated based upon actual historical stock price movements over the most recent periods equal to the expected option term 
expected pre vesting forfeitures are estimated based on actual historical pre vesting forfeitures over the most recent periods for the expected option term 
all of these estimates are inherently imprecise and may result in compensation cost being recorded that is materially different from the actual fair value of the stock options granted 
while the assumptions for expected stock price volatility and pre vesting forfeiture rates are updated with each year s option valuing process  there have not been significant revisions made in these estimates to date 
results of operations the following data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the associated notes contained elsewhere in this report

consolidated gross profit increased to million during compared to million in the prior year  an increase of 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue was during compared to during the prior year period 
our profitability during and was significantly affected by several factors  which are discussed in detail in the divisional comparisons section below 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million during compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to million of increased legal and professional services fees  million of increased bad debt expenses  million of increased office expenses  and million of other increased general expenses 
despite approximately million of increased option expense  total personnel costs increased only approximately million  due to decreased salaries  insurance  and other employee related expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were during compared to during the prior year 
impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of  we performed an annual test of goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
during the fourth quarter of  changes to the global economic environment resulting in uncertain capital markets and reductions in global economic activity have had a severe adverse impact on stock markets and oil and natural gas prices  both of which contributed to a significant decline in our company s stock price and corresponding market capitalization 
as part of the test of goodwill impairment  we have estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units  and have determined  based on these estimated values  that an impairment of the goodwill of our fluids and offshore services reporting units was necessary  primarily due to the market factors discussed above 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded total impairment charges of million associated with the goodwill impairment for these segments 
other income and expense other income and expense was million of income during compared to million of income during  primarily due to approximately million of increased ineffectiveness gains from liquidated commodity derivatives  million of increased equity from earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures  million of increased currency exchange gains  and million from increased gains from sales of long lived assets 
these increases were partially offset by approximately million of decreased other income  primarily due to a million legal settlement expensed during the current year and a million legal settlement credited to earnings during interest expense and income taxes net interest expense decreased from million during to million during the current year 
this decrease occurred despite the increased borrowings of long term debt used to fund our capital expenditure and acquisition requirements during and  and was due to lower interest rates during the period as well as due to increased interest capitalized associated with our capital construction projects 
interest expense will increase in future periods as these capital construction projects are completed and to the extent additional borrowings are used to fund our acquisition and capital expenditure plans 
our provision for income taxes during increased to million compared to million during the prior year  primarily due to the increased effective state tax rate for certain of our operations and the nondeductible nature of a portion of our goodwill impairments during net income loss net loss before discontinued operations was million during compared to net income of million in the prior year  a decrease of million 
net loss per diluted share before discontinued operations was on  average diluted shares outstanding during compared to net income per diluted share before discontinued operations of on  average diluted shares outstanding during the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold our process services operation for approximately million  net of certain adjustments  as such operations were not a strategic part of our core operations 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we made the decision to discontinue our venezuelan fluids and production testing businesses due to several factors  including the changing political climate in that country 
loss from discontinued operations was million during compared to income from discontinued operations of million during  primarily due to the million after tax gain on sale of the process services operations during the prior year 
net loss was million during compared to net income of million in the prior year  a decrease of million 
net loss per diluted share was on  average diluted shares outstanding during compared to of net income per diluted share on  average diluted shares outstanding in the prior year 
divisional comparisons fluids division fluids division revenues during were million  compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to million of increased revenues from the sales of manufactured products  particularly in europe  primarily resulting from increased pricing 
in addition  the division reported million of increased service revenues primarily due to increased domestic onshore service activity as well as the april acquisition of the assets and operations of a company providing fluids transfer and related services in support of high pressure fracturing processes 
these increases were partially offset by decreased brine sales revenues  which declined million due to decreased sales volumes and prices  particularly during the last half of  as many operators were recovering from the third quarter hurricanes 
a large portion of the demand for the division s products and services is affected by the level of drilling activity  including deepwater drilling  particularly in the gulf of mexico region 
this decrease in brine sales  particularly domestic offshore  is expected to continue during as operators continue to recover from the storms and as overall spending in the oil and gas industry remains decreased due to the current economic uncertainty 
however  during  we entered into a long term contract with petrobras to provide completion fluids for its deepwater drilling program offshore brazil  which should contribute added revenues during our fluids division gross profit increased to million during  compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to during the current year period compared to during the prior year 
this increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increased service activity discussed above 
in addition  rainy weather conditions during much of negatively impacted the division s onshore and completion services operations 
the increased raw material costs for certain of our manufactured products were largely offset by decreased brine costs 
a favorable long term supply for certain of the division s raw material needs has been secured  and the division has begun to reflect lower product costs as a result 
in december  the division terminated its remaining purchase commitment under its previous supply agreement in consideration of its agreement to pay million  which was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of fluids division income before taxes during totaled million compared to million in the corresponding prior year period  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was due to an impairment of the division s goodwill for million during the fourth quarter of  which more than offset the million increase in gross profit discussed above 
in addition  the division reported approximately million of decreased administrative expenses  and approximately million of increased other income  as a million charge for a legal settlement and million of decreased gains on asset sales were more than offset by million of increased foreign currency gains and million of increased earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures 
offshore division the revenues of our offshore division  which was formerly known as our well abandonment and decommissioning wa d division  decreased during from million during to million during the current year  a decrease of million or 
offshore division gross profit during totaled million compared to million during  an increase of million or 
offshore division loss before taxes was million during compared to a million loss before taxes during the prior year  a decrease of million 
the division s offshore services operations revenues decreased by to million during compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of million 
excluding intercompany work performed for maritech  offshore services revenues decreased by million  or 
decreased heavy lift capacity as compared to the prior year resulted in approximately million of decreased segment revenue  as the offshore services segment had two additional leased vessels operating during a portion of in addition  the division s operations were plagued by poor weather throughout much of due to three named storms in addition to hurricanes gustav and ike  resulting in disruptions to the division s planned activities 
these decreases were partially offset by increased diving and cutting services  which have particularly increased following the hurricanes which occurred during the third quarter of the division aims to capitalize on the current and expected demand for well abandonment  decommissioning  diving  and other service activity in the gulf of mexico  including the work to be performed over the next several years on offshore properties that were damaged or destroyed by hurricanes in and the offshore services segment of the division reported gross profit of million  a million decrease compared to million during offshore services gross profit as a percentage of revenues also decreased to during compared to during the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the million impairment of certain long lived assets during the year  a majority of which was associated with the overall assessment of the segment s assets as part of its annual goodwill impairment test pursuant to sfas no 
in addition  the segment experienced significant decreases in abandonment and decommissioning activity as a result of the reduced heavy lift capacity and weather disruptions throughout the year 
weather resulted in a postponement of several projects throughout the year  resulting in reduced efficiency and profit for these projects 
these decreases more than offset the operating efficiencies of our dive services business  which generated significant efficiencies from high utilization  particularly following the third quarter hurricanes 
in addition  during  the offshore services segment charged approximately million to operations related to a contested insurance claim 
intercompany profit on work performed for maritech s insured storm damage repairs is not recognized until such time as the associated insurance claim proceeds are collected by maritech 
during  insurance claim collections related to intercompany work performed in for maritech contributed to the recognition of an additional million of division intercompany gross profit 
the offshore services segment s income before taxes decreased from million during to million during  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was due to the million decrease in gross profit described above  and due to a million charge for goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of pursuant to sfas no 
in addition  other income decreased by approximately million  primarily due to a legal settlement received during the prior year 
these decreases were partially offset by a million decrease in administrative expenses 
the division s maritech operations reported revenues of million during compared to million during  a decrease of million  or 
as a result of hurricane ike during the third quarter of  maritech suffered damage to many of its offshore production platforms and third party pipelines and facilities  which caused many of its producing properties to be shut in during much of the last four months of three offshore platforms and one inland water production facility were destroyed by hurricane ike  one of which served a key producing field 
these destroyed platforms are in addition to the three offshore platforms destroyed by hurricanes during much of maritech s daily production is processed through neighboring platforms  pipelines  and processing facilities of other operators and third parties  many of which were also damaged during the storm 
as a result  a portion of maritech s production remains shut in 
due primarily to the impact of these storms and despite increased gas production as a result of successful exploitation and development activities and from the acquisitions of properties over the past two years  overall equivalent barrel production volumes decreased during compared to the prior year  resulting in million of decreased revenues 
this decrease was largely offset by million of increased revenue from higher oil and natural gas prices for much of compared to the prior year 
however  beginning in the third quarter of and continuing into  oil and natural gas prices have declined significantly 
maritech has hedged a portion of its expected future production levels by entering into derivative hedge contracts  with certain contracts extending through these hedge contracts are at prices significantly above the current market prices being received 
in addition to the impact from decreased production volumes and increased prices  maritech revenues also increased million during compared to the prior year due to increased platform processing revenues 
although we anticipate that many of maritech s remaining shut in properties will resume production during early  the full resumption of maritech s pre storm production levels may never occur and will depend on the extent of damage and the repairs or reconstruction needed on certain assets  including certain assets owned by third parties  the timing of which is outside of maritech s control 
in addition  while maritech plans to continue to replace its depleting oil and gas reserves through exploitation activities  the amount of such expenditures must now be evaluated more critically in light of the current lower price environment and our need to conserve capital 
the division s maritech operations reported a negative gross profit of million during compared to million of negative gross profit during  a decrease in the amount of loss of million or 
maritech s gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased during the current year to a negative compared to a negative during the prior year 
this increase occurred despite the segment s decrease in revenues during the current year due to the decreased amount of oil and gas property impairments during compared to maritech recorded million of impairments during  primarily due to the reversal of anticipated insurance recoveries as a result of certain future well intervention and debris removal costs being contested by our insurance provider 
this decrease in anticipated insurance recoveries further reduced maritech s gross profit associated with certain hurricane damage repair costs incurred and resulted in a million charge to operating expense  as the timing and amount of the reimbursement of these costs had become indeterminable 
during the fourth quarter of  maritech filed a lawsuit against certain of its insurance underwriters related to certain contested well intervention and debris removal costs incurred and to be incurred on three offshore platforms which were destroyed by hurricanes 
during the third and fourth quarters of  maritech recorded a total of million of oil and gas property impairments  primarily due to decreasing oil and natural gas prices 
in addition  maritech s gross profit increased during due to million of decreased excess decommissioning and abandoning costs 
the increased gross profit was partially offset by million of increased depreciation and depletion expense and million of increased dry hole costs 
while maritech s insurance costs decreased by million during compared to  we anticipate that insurance costs for offshore oil and gas properties will significantly increase in following the hurricanes  resulting in maritech experiencing reduced gross profit  higher deductibles  lower coverage levels  and potentially self insuring certain offshore properties 
the division s maritech operations reported a loss before taxes of million during compared to a million loss before taxes during the prior year  a million decrease in the amount of loss 
this decrease was due to the million decrease in negative gross profit and approximately million of increased other income  primarily due to gains on sales of properties  partially offset by million of increased administrative costs compared to the prior year 
production enhancement division beginning in the fourth quarter of  our production enhancement division consists of two separate reporting segments  our production testing segment and our compressco segment 
production enhancement division revenues increased significantly from million during to million during  an increase of million or 
production enhancement division gross profit during totaled million compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
production enhancement division income before taxes was million during compared to million of income before taxes during the prior year  an increase of million or 
production testing segment revenues increased from million during to million during the current year  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to million of revenues from increased domestic demand  where activity levels were high throughout despite decreased oil and natural gas pricing during the last portion of the year 
approximately million of the increased production testing revenues were also attributed to increased activity in mexico and brazil 
these increases were partially offset by million of decreased environmental service fees compared to the prior year 
production testing gross profit increased million during compared to  increasing from million to million during the current year  an increase of 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly  however  from during to during the current year 
the increased gross profit reflected the higher level of activity throughout  particularly for the segment s international operations 
production testing reported income before taxes of million during  compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
this increase was due to the increased gross profit discussed above and million of decreased other expense  primarily due to decreased foreign currency losses 
these increases were partially offset by approximately million of increased administrative costs 
the division s compressco segment revenues increased by approximately million during compared to the prior year  increasing from million during to million during the current year 
the majority of this increase occurred domestically  however  compressco s operations in mexico also increased significantly compared to the prior year 
compressco continued to add to its compressor fleet throughout to meet the growing demand for its services 
compressco s gross profit increased from million during to million during  an increase of million or  primarily due to increased activity 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased  however  from during to during  primarily due to increased operating costs for its domestic operations  despite increased strong margins on the growing mexican operations 
income before taxes for the compressco segment increased from million during to million during the current year  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to the million of increased gross profit discussed above  less approximately million of increased administrative costs and million of increased other expense 
corporate overhead corporate overhead includes corporate general and administrative expenses  interest income and expense  and other income and expense 
such expenses and income are not allocated to our operating divisions  as they relate to our general corporate activities 
corporate overhead decreased by million from million during to million during due to million of increased other income  primarily from increased ineffectiveness gains on liquidated derivative contracts  which resulted in million of other income 
these gains were partially offset by approximately million of increased corporate administrative costs and million of increased depreciation expense 
the increase in corporate administrative costs was primarily from million of increased personnel costs  primarily from increased stock option expense  approximately million of increased legal and professional fees  and approximately million of increased general expenses 
net corporate interest expense decreased approximately million due to lower interest rates and additional amounts of interest capitalized associated with our capital construction projects 
the increased capitalization of interest will continue until our significant capital construction projects are completed  which is expected to occur later during compared to consolidated comparisons revenues and gross profit total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for  an increase of 
consolidated gross profit decreased to million during compared to million in  a decrease of 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue was during compared to during our profitability during was significantly affected by several factors  which are discussed in detail in the divisional comparisons section below 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million during compared to million during  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to the increased headcount necessary to support our revenue growth and included approximately million of increased salary  benefits  contract labor costs  and other associated employee expenses  net of decreased incentive compensation 
the increase also included approximately million of increased office expenses and approximately million of increased insurance and bad debt expenses  which were partially offset by approximately million of decreased professional services and other general expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were during compared to during other income and expense other income and expense was million of income during compared to million of income during  due to approximately million of decreased gains from sales of assets and approximately million of decreased equity from earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures 
these decreases were partially offset by approximately million of increased other income  primarily due to a million legal settlement received during interest expense and income taxes net interest expense increased from million during to million during due to increased borrowings of long term debt used to fund our capital expenditure and acquisition requirements during and interest expense will increase in future periods to the extent additional borrowings are used to fund our acquisition and capital expenditure plans 
our provision for income taxes during decreased to million compared to million during  primarily due to decreased earnings 
net income net income before discontinued operations was million during compared to million in  a decrease of million 
net income per diluted share before discontinued operations was on  average diluted shares outstanding during compared to on  average diluted shares outstanding during during the fourth quarter of  we sold our process services operation for approximately million  net of certain adjustments  as such operations were not a strategic part of our core operations 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we made the decision to discontinue our venezuelan fluids and production testing businesses due to several factors  including the changing political climate in that country 
income from discontinued operations was million during compared to million during  primarily due to the million after tax gain on sale of the process services operations 
net income was million during compared to million in  a decrease of million 
net income per diluted share was on  average diluted shares outstanding during compared to on  average diluted shares outstanding in divisional comparisons fluids division fluids division revenues during were million  compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
approximately million of this increase was due to increased service activity  particularly for onshore services 
in september and april  the division completed the acquisitions of certain service assets and operations  expanding the division s completion services operations and allowing it to provide such services to customers in the arkansas  new mexico  texoma  and arklatex regions 
to a lesser extent  the increased revenues were also due to increased product pricing and international sales of the division s chemicals and cbf products 
a portion of the demand for the division s products and services is affected by the level of drilling activity  particularly deepwater drilling  in the gulf of mexico region 
fluids division gross profit decreased to million during  compared to million during  a decrease of million or 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to during  from during this decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the increased cost of raw materials for the division s products  which particularly affected the profitability of the division s offshore operations 
in addition  weather conditions during much of negatively impacted the division s onshore and completion services operations 
a favorable long term supply for certain of the division s raw material needs has been secured  and  in december  the division terminated its remaining purchase commitment under its previous supply agreement in consideration of its agreement to pay million  which was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of fluids division income before taxes during totaled million compared to million during  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was primarily generated by the million decrease in gross profit discussed above  along with approximately million of increased administrative expenses  partially offset by approximately million of increased other income  primarily from gains from foreign currency and sales of assets 
offshore division offshore division revenues increased significantly from million during to million during  an increase of million or

offshore division loss before taxes was million during compared to million of income before taxes during  a decrease of million or the division s offshore services operations revenues increased to million during compared to million in  an increase of million or 
excluding intercompany work performed for maritech  offshore services revenues increased by million  or 
approximately million of the segment s revenue increase was as a result of the march acquisition of the assets and operations of epic diving and marine services epic and the subsequent expansion and refurbishment of epic s dive support vessel fleet  which was completed in early  although one of these dive support vessels was idled during a portion of the year for mechanical problems 
additional segment revenue increases were primarily due to increased vessel activity levels during much of  although the utilization of these vessels was somewhat limited due to weather conditions during the second and third quarters 
the september acquisition of the assets and operations of eot rentals  llc eot also generated approximately million of increased revenues for cutting tool services provided to the division s customers  and is expected to contribute additional revenues in the future 
the offshore services segment of the division reported a million decrease in gross profit  a decrease  from million during to million during offshore services gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to during compared to during despite the increase in revenues  the segment experienced operating inefficiencies caused by weather disruptions and unfavorable contract issues that negatively affected gross profit  particularly during the first three quarters of in addition  epic s refurbished dive service vessels  which were placed into service during the first quarter of  also experienced lower utilization due to weather and maintenance issues  with one of its vessels experiencing significant mechanical problems during most of the third quarter 
during  the offshore services segment charged approximately million to operations related to a contested insurance claim 
during  we modified the segment s approach to providing our services associated with platforms that were damaged or destroyed by the storms 
intercompany profit on work performed for maritech s insured storm damage repairs is not recognized until such time as the associated insurance claim proceeds are collected by maritech 
during  intercompany profit of million was eliminated in consolidation 
during  insurance claim collections related to prior year intercompany work performed for maritech contributed to the recognition of an additional million of division intercompany gross profit 
the offshore services segment s income before taxes decreased from million during to million during  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was due to the million decrease in gross profit described above  as well as a million increase in administrative expenses due to the division s growth  partially offset by increased other income of approximately million  primarily from a legal settlement received during the division s maritech operations reported revenues of million during compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
increased production volumes generated increased revenues of approximately million  primarily from successful exploitation and development activities 
during and  maritech has expended approximately million on exploitation and development activities 
in addition  during a portion of the first quarter of  many of maritech s producing properties remained shut in as a result of third quarter hurricanes 
these revenue increases from increased production were partially offset by approximately million of lower realized oil and natural gas prices  including approximately million from decreased pricing for maritech s natural gas production 
realized natural gas prices during included the impact of a natural gas swap derivative hedge contract  which resulted in maritech realizing a price of mmbtu throughout for a portion of its gas production 
this derivative contract expired at the end of during and early  maritech entered into several new commodity hedge contracts extending through  including natural gas swap derivative hedge contracts  which resulted in maritech receiving an average price of mmbtu for a portion of its natural gas production 
in addition  during  maritech recorded approximately million less of prospect and other fee revenues compared to the prior year 
the division s maritech operations reported a negative gross profit of million during compared to million of positive gross profit during  a decrease of million or 
this decrease occurred despite the segment s exploitation and development activity  which resulted in the addition of several newly productive wells 
maritech s gross profit as a percentage of revenues also decreased during the current year to a negative compared to a positive during the prior year 
a large portion of this decrease in maritech s gross profit was due to approximately million of increased oil and gas property impairments 
maritech recorded million of impairments during  primarily due to the reversal of anticipated insurance recoveries as a result of certain future well intervention and debris removal costs being contested by our insurance provider  compared to million of impairments during this decrease in anticipated insurance recoveries further reduced maritech s gross profit associated with certain hurricane damage repair costs incurred  and resulted in a million charge to operating expense  as the timing and amount of the reimbursement of these costs has also become indeterminable 
during the fourth quarter of  maritech filed a lawsuit against certain of its insurance underwriters related to certain contested well intervention and debris removal costs incurred and to be incurred on certain offshore platforms which were destroyed by hurricanes 
in addition  maritech s gross profit decreased due to the decreased realized commodity prices discussed above  million of increased depletion expense  million of increased excess decommissioning and abandonment costs  and million of increased insurance premiums 
during  maritech also recorded increased dry hole costs of approximately million and reflected decreased gains from insurance proceeds compared to of approximately million 
the division s maritech operations reported a loss before taxes of million during compared to million of income before taxes during  a million decrease 
this decrease was due to the million decrease in gross profit and approximately million of decreased gains on sales of properties  partially offset by million of decreased administrative costs compared to  primarily due to decreased incentive compensation 
production enhancement division production enhancement division revenues increased from million during to million during  an increase of million or 
production enhancement division gross profit increased from million during to million during  an increase of million or 
income before taxes for the production enhancement division increased from million during to million during  an increase of million  or 
the division s production testing segment revenues increased from million during to million during  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to increased revenues provided by the beacon resources  llc subsidiary beacon  which was acquired in february increased production testing activity in mexico and brazil also contributed to the increased revenues during in addition  the segment recorded revenues of approximately million during related to an environmental services contract 
production testing gross profit increased from million during to million during  an increase of million  or 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues for the production testing segment decreased slightly  however  to during compared to during  primarily due to increased domestic operating costs 
increased gross profit was primarily provided by the segment s international operations in mexico and brazil 
production testing income before taxes increased million during compared to  increasing from million to million 
this increase was primarily due to the increased gross profit discussed above  less approximately million of increased administrative expense and million of decreased other income  primarily from decreased equity earnings in an unconsolidated joint venture and from decreased foreign currency gains 
compressco revenues increased by approximately million compared to the prior year period  from million during to million during this increase was due to compressco s overall growth both domestically and in latin america 
compressco continues to add to its compressor fleet to meet the growing demand for its services 
compressco gross profit during increased to million  a million increase compared to the million of gross profit during this increase reflected the increased overall activity  particularly in mexico 
as a percentage of revenue  however  gross profit decreased from during to during  due to increased domestic operating costs 
compressco income before income taxes increased from million during to million during  a million increase  or 
this increase was primarily due to the million of increased gross profit discussed above less approximately million of increased administrative costs 
corporate overhead corporate overhead includes corporate general and administrative expenses  interest income and expense  and other income and expense 
such expenses and income are not allocated to our operating divisions  as they relate to our general corporate activities 
corporate overhead increased by million from million during to million during  primarily due to increased net interest expense of approximately million 
this increase in corporate interest expense during was due to the increased outstanding balance of long term debt  which was used to fund our capital expenditure and acquisition requirements during and corporate general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million compared to the prior year  as approximately million of increased office expenses and approximately million of increased insurance expenses were offset by approximately million of decreased personnel related costs  primarily due to decreased incentive compensation recorded during in addition  during  we reflected approximately million of decreased other income 
liquidity and capital resources over each of the past three years  we have utilized our operating cash flow and increased our borrowings to aggressively grow our businesses  both through acquisitions as well as through our internal capital expenditure plans 
we continue to pursue a long term growth strategy that further expands our operations through significant internal growth  strategic acquisitions  and the establishment of operations in additional niche oil and gas service markets  both domestically and internationally 
in the current global economic market environment  however  these objectives must be balanced with the need to conserve capital  given the current limited availability of debt and equity financing on attractive terms and the potential reduction in operating cash flows 
our most significant ongoing capital expenditure projects include the construction of a new calcium chloride production facility in arkansas and a new headquarters office building  and these projects are continuing toward their completion during however  the balance of our planned capital expenditure activity  which is also funded through operating cash flows and our long term borrowing capacity  is being reviewed carefully in light of current financing constraints 
while our operating cash flows are currently reduced primarily due to lower oil and gas prices and the interruption of maritech production cash flows as a result of the september hurricanes  we will consider using any operating cash flow generated in excess of our reduced capital expenditure and other investing requirements to reduce the outstanding balance under our credit facility  which is scheduled to mature in mid although we continue to consider suitable acquisitions  the current environment may limit acquisitions to those which can be funded through available borrowing capacity  rather than through the issuance of new debt or equity 
operating activities cash flow generated by operating activities totaled approximately million during  compared to million during while the earnings for both years were greatly impacted by certain nonrecurring charges  such charges were generally for impairments and other non cash charges which did not affect our operating cash flows 
however  approximately of our operating cash flow was generated during the first three quarters of the year  and certain factors which affected our fourth quarter operating activities are expected to continue to affect our operations going forward 
the significant decline in oil and natural gas prices experienced during the last half of has directly affected the cash flow of oil and gas operators  including our maritech subsidiary 
accordingly  the demand for the products and services of many of our businesses has decreased compared to the first half of  which has resulted in decreased operating cash flow 
our future operating cash flow is particularly affected by activity levels in the gulf of mexico region of the us  which have remained flat over the past several years despite high oil and natural gas prices during this period 
although our consolidated revenues were increased during compared to  we anticipate overall demand for our products and services to decrease during we expect the operating cash flow impact from this decreased demand to be partially offset  however  by our efforts during the coming year to decrease our operating and administrative costs  capitalize on the continuing high demand for some of our offshore services businesses  and successfully manage the risks associated with the current offshore oil and gas exploration and production environment  including post hurricane insurance costs  damage repairs  and increased maritech decommissioning liabilities 
primarily during the fourth quarter of  we expended approximately million net to our interest for repairs of damage caused by hurricane ike  which damaged many of maritech s offshore platforms  wells and pipelines during the third quarter and toppled and destroyed three of its offshore platforms and one of its inland water production facilities 
hurricane ike caused lesser damage to certain assets of our fluids and offshore services segments 
of the repair costs incurred  only million represented qualifying costs in excess of deductibles and is considered probable of collection pursuant to maritech s insurance coverage and is therefore included in accounts receivable as of december  we estimate that remaining storm damage for maritech s partially damaged platforms will result in approximately million to million of additional repair work to be done during  and we expect that a majority of these repairs will be reimbursed pursuant to insurance coverage 
the timing of the collection of any future insurance reimbursements is beyond our control  however  and we will continue to use a significant amount of our working capital until such reimbursements are received 
with regard to hurricanes katrina and rita  which occurred during  a portion of the repair and well intervention costs on the three destroyed offshore platforms was previously expended  was submitted to insurance  and has been reimbursed  however  our insurance underwriters have continued to maintain that costs for certain of the damaged wells do not qualify as covered costs and that certain well intervention and repair costs for qualifying wells are not covered under the policy for that period 
in addition  the underwriters have also maintained that there is no additional coverage provided under an endorsement we obtained in august for the cost of removal of platforms destroyed by the storms or the repair of other damage on certain properties in excess of the insured values provided by our property damage policy for that period 
in late  we filed a lawsuit against the underwriters  adjuster  and one of our brokers in a further attempt to collect the reimbursement for these well intervention and repair costs incurred as well as future well intervention and debris removal costs to be incurred resulting from the hurricanes 
our operating cash flows also continue to be affected by the interruption in maritech s oil and gas production due to damaged offshore platforms and pipelines as a result of the hurricanes 
approximately of maritech s pre storm oil production and of its natural gas production is currently shut in 
one of the destroyed offshore platforms served the east cameron field  which produced approximately of our pre storm oil production 
in addition  much of maritech s daily production is processed through neighboring platforms  pipelines  and processing facilities of other operators and third parties 
while repair and recovery efforts have been prioritized to restore maritech s production as soon as possible  these production restoration efforts are expected to continue beyond although we anticipate that many of maritech s remaining shut in properties will resume during early  the complete resumption of production from the east cameron field will require several wells to be redrilled 
the full resumption of maritech s pre storm production levels may never occur and will depend on the extent of damage and the repairs or reconstruction needed on certain assets  including certain assets owned by third parties 
future operating cash flow will continue to be affected by the oil and gas prices received for maritech s production 
although a majority of maritech s production is currently hedged  during the first half of  pre hedge prices received for maritech s oil and gas production averaged and  respectively 
during december  these prices averaged and  respectively 
during and early  following the acquisitions and exploitation and development drilling operations that increased its oil and gas production levels  maritech entered into additional oil and natural gas swap derivative transactions  some of which extend through  that are designated to hedge a portion of maritech s operating cash flows from risks associated with the fluctuating prices of oil and natural gas 
each of these swap derivative contracts result in maritech receiving a fixed price for oil and natural gas for hedged production that is in excess of prices currently being received for its unhedged production  mitigating the impact of current low oil and natural gas prices 
future operating cash flow will also be affected by the timing and amount of expenditures required for the plugging  abandonment  and decommissioning of maritech s oil and gas properties 
the third party discounted fair value  including an estimated profit  of maritech s decommissioning liability as of december  totals million million undiscounted 
during  maritech s decommissioning liability increased by approximately million primarily due to the january acquisition of additional properties and due to the third quarter hurricanes  which toppled three of maritech s offshore platforms and one of its inland water production facilities and increased the cost of work to perform on these properties  net of expected insurance recoveries 
see below for a further discussion of the estimated costs related to these six toppled offshore platforms 
this increase was net of approximately million of plugging  abandonment  and decommissioning operations expended during the year on a portion of maritech s properties 
the cash outflow necessary to extinguish the remainder of maritech s decommissioning liability is expected to occur over several years  shortly after the end of each property s productive life 
the amount and timing of these cash outflows are estimated based on expected costs  as well as on the timing of future oil and gas production and the resulting depletion of maritech s oil and gas reserves 
such estimates are imprecise and subject to change due to changing cost estimates  mms requirements  commodity prices  revisions of reserve estimates  and other factors 
following the and hurricanes  maritech has six offshore platforms and one remaining inland water production facility which have been toppled and destroyed 
the estimated cost to perform well intervention  decommissioning  and debris removal efforts on these platforms is particularly imprecise due to the unique nature of the work to be performed 
maritech estimates that future well intervention and abandonment efforts  including costs to remove debris  reconstruct certain destroyed structures  and redrill certain wells associated with these destroyed platforms and production facility  will cost from million to million  net to our interest before any insurance recoveries 
actual costs could greatly exceed these estimates 
maritech incurred well intervention costs related to hurricane damage suffered in  and certain of those costs have not been reimbursed by insurers 
we have reviewed the types of remaining estimated well intervention costs to be incurred related to the six toppled platforms  including those costs related to the storms 
despite our belief that substantially all of these costs qualify for coverage under our insurance policies  any costs that are similar to the costs that have not yet been reimbursed following the storms are excluded from anticipated insurance recoveries 
maritech s estimated decommissioning liabilities are also net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners and any contractual amounts to be paid by the previous owners of the properties 
in some cases  the previous owners are contractually obligated to pay maritech a fixed amount for the future well abandonment and decommissioning work on these properties as the work is performed  partially offsetting maritech s future obligation expenditures 
as of december   maritech s total undiscounted decommissioning obligation is approximately million and consists of maritech s total liability of million  plus approximately million  which is contractually required to be reimbursed to maritech pursuant to such contractual arrangements with the previous owners 
investing activities during  we expended approximately million of cash for capital expenditures  the largest amount of annual capital expenditures in our history 
approximately million of this amount was spent on the construction of a new calcium chloride facility located in el dorado  arkansas  which we expect will be completed in the fourth quarter of at a total cost of approximately million 
in addition  we expended approximately million during on the construction of our new corporate headquarters in the woodlands  texas  which was completed in february at a total cost of approximately million 
over the past three years  we have invested approximately million of cash for capital expenditures and acquisitions  including approximately million  or approximately  for the acquisition  exploration  exploitation  and development activities by our maritech subsidiary to increase its oil and gas reserves and replace its production 
in particular  the december acquisition by maritech of the cimarex properties resulted in the purchase of additional proved reserves and additional prospects for future drilling and development 
in addition to its continuing capital expenditure program  maritech also continues to pursue the purchase of additional producing oil and gas properties to provide additional exploration  exploitation and development opportunities 
during  our cash capital expenditures totaled approximately million and included approximately million by our offshore division  of which approximately million was expended by the division s maritech segment  including approximately million for the acquisition of producing properties in january and approximately million for the construction of a new connecting pipeline for its cimarex properties 
in addition  our offshore division expended approximately million relating to the offshore services segment operations  primarily for vessel and equipment purchases and refurbishments 
the fluids division reflected approximately million of capital expenditures  primarily related to the el dorado calcium chloride plant project discussed above 
the production enhancement division spent approximately million  consisting of approximately million related to compressor fleet expansion by our compressco segment  and approximately million to replace and enhance a portion of the testing equipment fleet by our production testing segment 
corporate capital expenditures were approximately million and consisted primarily of the construction costs for our new corporate office building 
although our investing activities have been extensive during the past several years  beginning in late our capital expenditure plans have been reviewed carefully in light of the current capital market constraints  as discussed in the financing activities section below 
generally  a significant majority of our planned capital expenditures is related to identified opportunities to grow and expand our existing businesses  however  certain of these expenditures may now be postponed or cancelled due to the current environment 
we plan to expend over million on additional capital additions during  however  approximately million of this amount represents the costs to complete our el dorado  arkansas calcium chloride facility and our new corporate headquarters building located in the woodlands  texas 
we expect to fund our capital expenditure activity through cash flows from operations and from our bank credit facility 
many of our other capital expenditure plans will be deferred until they can be funded from operating cash flow  without increasing the balance outstanding under our bank credit facility 
this restraint on capital expenditure activity may result in a suspension from the aggressive growth strategy we have experienced over the past several years  and in the case of maritech  may result in negative growth as a result of postponing the replacement of depleting oil and gas reserves and production cash flows 
however  our long term growth strategy continues to include the pursuit of suitable acquisitions or opportunities to establish operations in additional niche oil and gas service markets  and even in the current environment  this activity is continuing 
to the extent we consummate a significant acquisition  our liquidity position will be affected 
financing activities to fund our capital and working capital requirements  we may supplement our existing cash balances and cash flow from operating activities as needed from long term borrowings  short term borrowings  equity issuances  and other sources of capital 
bank credit facilities we have a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks  pursuant to a credit agreement which was amended in june and december the credit agreement 
as of february   we had an outstanding balance of million  and million in letters of credit and guarantees against the million revolving credit facility  leaving a net availability of million 
pursuant to the credit agreement  the revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in june  is unsecured  and guaranteed by certain of our material domestic subsidiaries 
borrowings generally bear interest at the british bankers association libor rate plus to  depending on one of our financial ratios 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding balance under the credit facility was 
we pay a commitment fee ranging from to on unused portions of the facility 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants and other restrictions  including certain financial ratio covenants involving our levels of debt and interest cost compared to a defined measure of our operating cash flow over a twelve month period 
in addition  the credit agreement includes limitations on aggregate asset sales  individual acquisitions  and aggregate annual acquisitions and capital expenditures 
access to our revolving credit line is dependent upon our ability to continue to comply with the certain financial ratio covenants set forth in the credit agreement  as discussed above 
significant deterioration of the financial ratios could result in a default under the credit agreement and  if not remedied  could result in termination of the agreement and acceleration of any outstanding balances under the facility prior to the credit agreement also includes cross default provisions relating to any other indebtedness greater than a defined amount 
if any such indebtedness is not paid or is accelerated and such event is not remedied in a timely manner  a default will occur under the credit agreement 
we were in compliance with all covenants and conditions of our credit agreement as of december  our continuing ability to comply with these financial covenants centers largely upon our ability to generate adequate cash flow 
historically  our financial performance has been more than adequate to meet these covenants  and subject to the duration of the current economic environment  we expect this trend to continue

the note purchase agreement and the master note purchase agreement also contain customary default provisions as well as a cross default provision relating to any other of our indebtedness of million or more 
we are in compliance with all covenants and conditions of the note purchase agreement and the master note purchase agreement as of december  upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default under the note purchase agreement and the master note purchase agreement  as supplemented  the senior notes may become immediately due and payable  either automatically or by declaration of holders of more than in principal amount of the senior notes outstanding at the time 
other sources in addition to the aforementioned revolving credit facility  we fund our short term liquidity requirements from cash generated by operations  from short term vendor financing and  to a lesser extent  from leasing with institutional leasing companies 
should additional capital be required  we believe that we have the ability to raise such capital through the issuance of additional debt or equity 
current market conditions  however  have made it increasingly difficult to access capital  either debt or equity  on acceptable terms 
continued instability in the capital markets  as a result of recession or otherwise  may continue to affect the cost of capital and the ability to raise capital for an indeterminable length of time 
as discussed above  our bank revolving credit facility matures in june and our senior notes mature at various dates between september and april unless current market conditions improve prior to the dates of these maturities  the replacement of these capital sources at similar or more favorable terms is unlikely 
given the current environment  it may be necessary to utilize our equity to fund our capital needs or issue as consideration in an acquisition transaction  either of which could result in dilution to our common stockholders 
in may  we filed a universal acquisition shelf registration statement on form s that permits us to issue up to million of common stock  preferred stock  senior and subordinated debt securities  and warrants in one or more acquisition transactions that we may undertake from time to time 
as part of our strategic plan  we evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses and assets and intend to consider attractive acquisition opportunities  which may involve the payment of cash or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
such acquisitions may be funded with existing cash balances  funds under our credit facility  or securities issued under our acquisition shelf registration on form s during the fourth quarter of  we liquidated the swap derivative contracts related to the remainder of maritech s production in exchange for net cash received of approximately million 
as of december   the market value of our remaining oil and natural gas swap contracts was approximately million 
all or a portion of these contracts are marketable to the corresponding counterparty and could be liquidated in order to generate additional cash 
the liquidation of any of these swap contracts would expose an additional portion of maritech s expected future oil and gas production to market price volatility in future periods 
in january  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
during  and  we made no purchases of our common stock pursuant to this authorization 
we also received million  million  and million during  and  respectively  from the exercise of stock options by employees 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due total thereafter in thousands long term debt interest on debt purchase obligations decommissioning and other asset retirement obligations acquisition contingent consideration operating leases total contractual cash obligations decommissioning liabilities related to oil and gas properties generally must be satisfied within twelve months after a property s lease expires 
lease expiration generally occurs six months after the last producing well on the lease ceases production 
we have estimated the timing of these payments based upon anticipated lease expiration dates  which are subject to many changing variables  including the estimated life of the producing oil and gas properties  which is affected by changing oil and gas commodity prices 
the amounts shown represent the undiscounted obligation as of december  amounts exclude other long term liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet that do not have known payment streams 
these excluded amounts include approximately million of liabilities under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlements 
see note f income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
approximately million of the amounts expected to be paid in represents well intervention  abandonment  decommissioning  and debris removal related to offshore platforms destroyed in the and hurricanes  net of anticipated insurance recoveries 
insurance recoveries pursuant to the hurricanes are being contested by the insurers  and are not included 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is defined as any contractual arrangement to which an entity that is not consolidated with us is a party  under which we have  or in the future may have any obligation under a guarantee contract that requires initial recognition and measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity  or market risk support to that entity for the transferred assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  or any obligation under a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development services with us 
as of december  and  we had no off balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
commitments and contingencies litigation we are named defendants in several lawsuits and respondents in certain governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of lawsuits or other proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty  management does not reasonably expect these matters to have a material adverse impact on the financial statements 
class action lawsuit between march  and april   two putative class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of texas houston division against us and certain of our officers by certain stockholders on behalf of themselves and other stockholders who purchased our common stock between january  and october  the complaints assert claims under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and rule b promulgated thereunder 
the complaints allege that the defendants violated the federal securities laws during the period by  among other things  disseminating false and misleading statements and or concealing material facts concerning our current and prospective business and financial results 
the complaints also allege that  as a result of these actions  our stock price was artificially inflated during the class period  which enabled our insiders to sell their personally held shares for a substantial gain 
the complaints seek unspecified compensatory damages  costs  and expenses 
on may   the court consolidated these complaints as in re tetra technologies  inc securities litigation  no 
cv sd sd on august   lead plaintiff fulton county employees retirement system filed its amended consolidated complaint 
on october   we filed a motion to dismiss the federal class action 
between may  and june   two petitions were filed by alleged stockholders in the district courts of harris county  texas  rd and th judicial districts  purportedly on our behalf 
the suits name our directors and certain officers as defendants 
the factual allegations in these lawsuits mirror those in the class actions  and the claims are for breach of fiduciary duty  unjust enrichment  abuse of control  gross mismanagement  and waste of corporate assets 
the petitions seek disgorgement  costs  expenses  and unspecified equitable relief 
on september   the rd district court consolidated these complaints as in re tetra technologies  inc derivative litigation  cause no 
rd dist 
ct  harris county  tex  and appointed thomas prow and mark patricola as co lead plaintiffs 
this case has been stayed by agreement of the parties pending the court s ruling on our motion to dismiss the federal class action 
at this stage  it is impossible to predict the outcome of these proceedings or their impact upon us 
we currently believe that the allegations made in the federal complaints and state petitions are without merit  and we intend to seek dismissal of and vigorously defend against these actions 
while a successful outcome cannot be guaranteed  we do not reasonably expect these lawsuits to have a material adverse effect 
insurance litigation through december   we have expended approximately million of well intervention work on certain wells associated with two of the three maritech offshore platforms which were destroyed as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita in we estimate that future repair and well intervention efforts related to these destroyed platforms  including platform debris removal and other storm related costs  will result in approximately million to million of additional costs 
approximately million of the well intervention costs previously expended and submitted to our insurance providers have been reimbursed  however  our insurance underwriters have continued to maintain that well intervention costs for certain of the damaged wells do not qualify as covered costs and that certain well intervention costs for qualifying wells are not covered under the policy 
in addition  the underwriters have also maintained that there is no additional coverage provided under an endorsement we obtained in august for the cost of removal of these platforms or for other damage repairs on certain properties in excess of the insured values provided by our property damage policy 
after continuing to provide requested information to the underwriters regarding the damaged wells  and having numerous discussions with the underwriters  brokers  and insurance adjusters  we have yet to receive the requested reimbursement for these contested costs 
on november   we filed a lawsuit in the th judicial district court  montgomery county  texas  entitled maritech resources  inc v 
certain underwriters and insurance companies at lloyd s  london subscribing to policy no 
gau and steege kingston  in which we are seeking damages for breach of contract and various related claims and a declaration of the extent of coverage of an endorsement to the policy 
we cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit 
we continue to believe that these costs qualify for coverage pursuant to the policy 
however  during the fourth quarter of  we reversed the anticipated insurance recoveries previously included in estimating maritech s decommissioning liability  increasing the decommissioning liability to million for well intervention and debris removal work to be performed  assuming no insurance reimbursements will be received 
in addition  we have reversed a portion of our anticipated insurance recoveries previously included in accounts receivable related to certain damage repair costs incurred  as the amount and timing of further reimbursements from our insurance providers are now indeterminable 
as a result of the increase to the decommissioning liability  certain capitalized property costs were not realizable  resulting in impairments in accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting 
see note b summary of significant accounting policies  oil and gas properties  for further discussion 
if we successfully collect our reimbursement from our insurance providers  such reimbursements will be credited to operations in the period collected 
in the event that our actual well intervention costs are more or less than the associated decommissioning liabilities  as adjusted  the difference may be reported in income in the period in which the work is performed 
environmental one of our subsidiaries  tetra micronutrients  inc tmi  previously owned and operated a production facility located in fairbury  nebraska

vii h  dated september  the consent order  with regard to the fairbury facility 
tmi is liable for future remediation costs and ongoing environmental monitoring at the fairbury facility under the consent order  however  the current owner of the fairbury facility is responsible for costs associated with the closure of that facility 
we have reviewed estimated remediation costs prepared by our independent  third party environmental engineering consultant  based on a detailed environmental study 
the estimated remediation costs range from million to million 
based upon our review and discussions with our third party consultants  we established a reserve for such remediation costs which is included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and following the performance of the required remediation activities at the site  the amount of the reserve for these remediation costs  included in current liabilities  is approximately million 
the reserve will be further adjusted as information develops or conditions change 
we have not been named a potentially responsible party by the epa or any state environmental agency 
product purchase obligations in the normal course of our fluids division operations  we enter into supply agreements with certain manufacturers of various raw materials and finished products 
some of these agreements have terms and conditions that specify a minimum or maximum level of purchases over the term of the agreement 
other agreements require us to purchase the entire output of the raw material or finished product produced by the manufacturer 
our purchase obligations under these agreements apply only with regard to raw materials and finished products that meet specifications set forth in the agreements 
we recognize a liability for the purchase of such products at the time we receive them 
during  we significantly increased our purchase obligations as a result of the execution of a long term supply agreement with chemtura corporation and the amendment of a previous supply agreement 
under the amended agreement with the previous supplier  we remained committed to purchase certain volumes of product through in december  we were released from these further purchases pursuant to an agreement terminating the amended agreement in exchange for our agreement to pay million in five installments during and early as of december   the aggregate amount of the fixed and determinable portion of the purchase obligation pursuant to our fluids division s supply agreements was approximately million  extending through other contingencies related to its acquired interests in oil and gas properties  our maritech subsidiary estimates the third party fair values including an estimated profit to plug and abandon wells  decommission the pipelines and platforms  and clear the sites  and uses these estimates to record maritech s decommissioning liabilities  net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners and any amounts contractually agreed to be paid in the future by the previous owners of the properties 
in some cases  previous owners of acquired oil and gas properties are contractually obligated to pay maritech a fixed amount for the future well abandonment and decommissioning work on these properties as such work is performed 
as of december   maritech s decommissioning liabilities are net of approximately million for such future reimbursements from these previous owners 
in march  we acquired beacon resources  llc beacon  a production testing operation  for approximately million paid at closing and an additional million to be paid  subject to adjustment  over a three year period through march in addition  the acquisition provides for additional contingent consideration of up to million to be paid in march  depending on the average of beacon s annual pretax results of operations over the three year period following the closing date through march we currently anticipate that a payment will be required pursuant to this contingent consideration provision of the agreement  since  as of december   the amount of beacon s pretax results of operations as defined in the agreement from the date of the acquisition is now in excess of the minimum amount required to generate a payment 
any amount payable pursuant to this contingent consideration provision will be reflected as a liability and added to goodwill as it becomes fixed and determinable at the end of the three year period 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb published statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which requires entities to provide greater transparency about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 
and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after november  we anticipate that the issuance of sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations

the new disclosure requirements include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves in certain circumstances 
the new requirements also will allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves  require companies to report on the independence and qualifications of a reserves preparer or auditor  file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserve estimates or conduct a reserves audit  and report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior twelve month period  rather than year end prices 
these new reporting requirements are effective for annual reports on form k for fiscal years ending on or after december  we are currently assessing the impact that adoption of the new disclosure requirements will have on our disclosures of oil and gas reserves

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk any balances outstanding under the floating rate portion of our bank credit facility are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in applicable interest rates 
we borrow funds pursuant to our bank credit facility as necessary to fund our capital expenditure requirements and certain acquisitions 
these instruments carry interest at an agreed upon percentage rate spread above libor 
based on the balances of floating rate debt outstanding as of december   each increase of basis points in the libor rate would result in a decrease in earnings of approximately million 
the following table sets forth  as of december  and  our cash flows for the outstanding principal balances of our long term debt obligations which bear a variable rate of interest and weighted average effective interest rates by their expected maturity dates

in september  we borrowed euros to fund the acquisition of our european calcium chloride assets 
we entered into long term euro denominated borrowings  as we believe such borrowings provide a natural currency hedge for our euro based operating cash flow 
in our european operations  we also have exposure related to operating receivables and payables denominated in euros as well as other currencies  however  such transactions are not pursuant to long term contract terms  and the amount of such foreign currency exposure is not determinable or considered material 
we also have operations in other foreign countries in which we have exposure to the fluctuation between the local currencies in those markets and the us dollar 
we currently have no hedges in place with regard to these currencies 
the following table sets forth as of december  and  our cash flows for the outstanding principal balances of our long term debt obligations which are denominated in euros 
this information is presented in us dollar equivalents 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by their expected maturity dates 
as described above  we utilize the long term borrowings detailed in the following table as a hedge to our investment in our acquired foreign operations and  currently  we are not a party to a foreign currency swap contract or other derivative instrument designed to further hedge our currency exchange rate risk exposure 
our exchange rate risk exposure related to these borrowings will generally be offset by the offsetting fluctuations in the value of the related foreign investment

realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices in the us natural gas market 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such price volatility is expected to continue 
our risk management activities involve the use of derivative financial instruments  such as swap agreements  to hedge the impact of market price risk exposures for a portion of our oil and gas production 
we are exposed to the volatility of oil and gas prices for the portion of our oil and gas production that is not hedged 
net of the impact of the crude oil hedges as of december  described below  each per barrel decrease in future crude oil prices would result in a decrease in after tax earnings of million 
each decrease in future gas prices of per mcf would result in a decrease in after tax earnings of million

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting

a increase in the future price of oil would result in the market value of the combined oil derivative asset decreasing by million 
based on an average nymex strip price over the remaining contract term of mmbtu  the market value of our natural gas swaps at december  was million 
a increase in the future price of natural gas would result in the market value of the combined natural gas derivative asset decreasing by million 
the portion of these market values associated with swap contracts is reflected as a current asset  and the portion related to later periods is reflected as a long term asset 
the market value of our oil swaps at december  was million  which is reflected as a liability 
a increase in the future price of oil would have resulted in the market value of the combined oil derivative liability decreasing by million 
the market value of our natural gas swaps at december  was million  which is reflected as a current asset
