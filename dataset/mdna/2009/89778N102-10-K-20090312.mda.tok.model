table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company creating a pipeline of novel protein therapeutic product candidates to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and cancer 
our mission is to develop a variety of first in class and best in class product candidates customized in an effort to optimize safety  efficacy  and convenience that we believe may offer improved patient experiences 
our current product candidates are novel small modular immunopharmaceutical  or smip tm  therapeutics  a new generation of antibody alternatives 
our current therapeutics under development target specific antigens on b cells such as cd and cd  and are designed using our custom drug assembly technology 
in order to fund ongoing development activities and commercialize our products  we will  in some cases  enter into collaboration agreements that would likely include licenses to our technology and arrangements to provide research and development services for others 
our lead product candidate  tru  which we are developing with our partner wyeth  has completed a phase b clinical trial for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  or ra  and a second phase b clinical trial is under way 
the randomized  parallel  double blind  placebo controlled  dose regimen finding study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of two dosing regimens of tru administered to patients with active seropositive rheumatoid factor  or rf  on a background of methotrexate 
this study was designed in a way that we believe could be supportive of a registration package with the fda 
in collaboration with us  wyeth is also developing sbi  our next generation cd directed product candidate 
sbi for ra builds on our and wyeth s clinical experience with our lead compound  tru  and is based on our smip technology 
wyeth has commenced a phase i study of sbi for ra  and patient dosing is underway 
in addition to ra  wyeth intends to pursue clinical evaluation of sbi in systemic lupus erythematosus  or sle  and wyeth has filed an ind application for this indication 
our proprietary product candidate  tru  is a novel cd directed therapy for the treatment of b cell mediated diseases  such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia  or cll  and certain autoimmune and inflammatory disease indications 
tru uses a different mechanism of action than cd directed therapies 
as a result  we believe its novel design may provide patients with improved therapeutic options and enhance efficacy when used alone or in combination with chemotherapy and or cd directed therapeutics 
patient dosing has commenced in a phase clinical trial for patients with cll 
in december we entered into a collaboration agreement with wyeth for the development and worldwide commercialization of tru and other cd directed therapeutics 
pursuant to the agreement  we are also collaborating with wyeth on the development and worldwide commercialization of certain other product candidates directed to a small number of targets other than cd during the period in which we will be providing research services for wyeth  wyeth has the right  subject to our reasonable consent  to replace a limited number of these targets 
in addition  we have the option to co promote with wyeth  on customary terms to be agreed  cd directed therapies in the united states for niche indications 
we retain the right to develop and commercialize  on our own or with others  product candidates directed to all targets not included within the agreement  including cd unless it is terminated earlier  our agreement with wyeth will remain in effect on a product by product basis and on a country by country basis until the later of the date that any such product shall no longer be covered by a valid claim of a us or foreign patent or application and  generally  ten years after the first commercial sale of any product licensed under the agreement 
in connection with the agreement  wyeth paid us a million non refundable  non creditable  up front fee in january and purchased directly from us in a private placement  concurrent with our initial public 
table of contents offering   shares of our common stock at the initial public offering price of per share  resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
under the agreement  we provided research services for an initial three year period ended december  with the option for wyeth to extend the service period for two additional one year periods 
wyeth s financial obligations during the initial research service term include collaborative research funding commitments of million in exchange for such committed research services 
this million was subject to an increase if the service period was extended beyond three years as well as annual increases pursuant to percentage changes in the cpi 
in june  wyeth exercised the first option under the terms of the agreement to extend the research period for an additional one year period through december  due to the research period extension  wyeth s collaboration research funding commitments to us increased by approximately million in exchange for committed research services from us through december  wyeth s financial obligations include additional amounts for reimbursement of agreed upon external research and development costs and patent costs 
pursuant to the agreement  wyeth is also obligated to make payments to us of up to million based on the achievement of specified regulatory and sales milestones for cd directed therapies and payments to us of up to million based on the specified achievement of regulatory and sales milestones for therapies directed to the small number of targets other than cd in addition  we will receive royalty payments in the event of future licensed product sales 
wyeth may terminate the agreement without cause at any time upon days prior written notice 
in january  pfizer and wyeth announced that they have entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which pfizer will acquire wyeth 
in the event of a change of control of wyeth  the agreement would remain in effect and we are entitled to request further written assurances from the successor in interest to wyeth reaffirming the commitment of the successor in interest to comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement 
if the successor in interest to wyeth has ongoing development and or commercialization activities that would violate the mutual exclusivity provisions of the collaboration agreement  we have the right to require the successor in interest to engage in good faith discussions regarding the terms and conditions on which the successor in interest would pay reasonable financial consideration to us with respect to those development and commercialization activities 
if we and the successor in interest do not agree to terms  we have the right to require the successor in interest to enter into an agreement to divest such development and commercialization activities  or to divest the relevant collaboration agreement products to a third party 
if the successor in interest does not divest such development and commercialization activities or such collaboration agreement products  we have the right to terminate all licenses related to cd and or the additional specified target  as applicable 
if in connection with wyeth s change of control  wyeth is required or voluntarily decides to divest itself of one or more of the products under the collaboration agreement  then wyeth must offer us an exclusive opportunity to negotiate the acquisition or license of all of wyeth s rights to that product on commercially reasonable terms 
if we do not conclude an agreement with wyeth covering the product  wyeth can divest itself of the product but the terms of that divestiture cannot be more favorable than those that were last offered to us unless we are given the opportunity to accept those more favorable terms 
upon a change of control of trubion  the agreement would remain in effect  subject to the right of wyeth to terminate specified provisions of the agreement 
assuming tru and other product candidates under the collaboration with wyeth continue to progress in development  expenses for future clinical trials may be higher than those incurred in prior clinical trials 
these expenses will  however  likely be incurred by wyeth and expenses incurred by us  if any  will be substantially offset by reimbursement revenue from wyeth 
in addition  wyeth is responsible for a substantial portion of costs related to patent prosecution and patent litigation for products directed to targets selected by wyeth pursuant to the collaboration agreement 
the continued research and development of our product candidates will require significant additional expenditures  including preclinical studies  clinical trials  manufacturing costs  and the expenses of seeking regulatory approval 
we rely on third parties to conduct a portion of our preclinical studies  all of our clinical 
table of contents trials and all of the manufacturing of current good manufacturing process  or cgmp  material 
we expect expenditures associated with these activities to increase in future years as we continue developing our product candidates 
expenditures associated with our product candidates included in the wyeth collaboration will be substantially offset by reimbursement revenue from wyeth 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million and total stockholders equity was million 
during the year ended december   and  we recognized net losses of million  million and million  respectively 
we expect our net losses to increase as we continue our existing preclinical studies  manufacturing  and clinical trials and expand our research and development efforts 
in addition  revenue may decrease in the future as a result of the transfer to wyeth of the responsibility for the majority of the clinical development efforts and related costs for product candidates covered by our collaboration agreement with wyeth  which may result in a decline in the associated collaborative research revenue  and a decline in revenue associated with the amortization of the up front fee paid by wyeth as the estimated service period is extended 
we were founded as a limited liability company in the state of washington in march we converted into a corporation and redomiciled in the state of delaware in october to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  strategic alliances  equipment financings  and government grants 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this annual report on form k 
although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual results may differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our audited financial statements for the year ended december  in this annual report on form k 
of our significant accounting policies  we believe that the following accounting policies relating to revenue recognition  preclinical study and clinical trial accruals  stock based compensation and valuation of investments are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from our collaboration agreement with wyeth  which consists of non refundable  non creditable up front fees and license fees  collaborative research funding  regulatory and sales milestones  and future product royalties 
revenue related to the wyeth collaboration is recognized as follows up front fees and license fee 
non refundable  non creditable up front fees and license fees received in connection with collaborative research and development agreements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated term of the research and development service period 
the estimated term of the research and development service period is reviewed and adjusted based on the status of the project against the estimated timeline as additional information becomes available 
we also consider the time frame of our substantive contractual obligations related to research and development agreements when estimating the term of the research and development period 
during the third quarter of  the estimated term of the research and development service period was adjusted from six years and three months to seven years  or through december  due to an extension of the estimated service period of our obligations to conduct 
table of contents clinical activities under our agreement with wyeth 
currently  our clinical development obligations under the agreement are limited to conducting ongoing re treatment studies for tru the ongoing second phase b study and future studies will be conducted by wyeth 
the adjustment during the third quarter of was the second adjustment to the estimated research and development service period since the inception of the collaboration agreement with wyeth 
adjustments to the research and development service period are made prospectively 
revenue may fluctuate in the future due to adjustments to the estimated term of the research and development service period 
collaborative research funding 
certain internal and external research and development costs and patent costs are reimbursed in connection with collaboration agreements 
reimbursed costs are recognized as revenue in the same period the costs were incurred 
reimbursed costs are subject to the estimation processes described in the preclinical study  clinical trial and manufacturing accruals processes described below and are subject to change in future periods when actual activity is known 
to date we have not made any material adjustments to these estimates 
milestones 
payments for milestones that are based on the achievement of substantive and at risk performance criteria will be recognized in full at such time as the specified milestone has been achieved according to the terms of the agreement 
when payments are not for substantive and at risk milestones  revenue will be recognized immediately for the proportionate amount of the payment that correlates to services that have already been rendered  with the balance recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated term of the research and development service period 
the basis of the research and development service period is reviewed and adjusted based on the status of the project against the estimated timeline as additional information becomes available 
preclinical study  clinical trial and manufacturing accruals we estimate our preclinical study  clinical trial and manufacturing accrued expenses based on our estimates of the services received pursuant to contracts with multiple research organizations and contract manufacturers that conduct  manage  and provide materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
research and development costs are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
our preclinical study  clinical trial and manufacturing expenses include the following fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical studies  fees paid to clinical research organizations and other clinical sites in connection with clinical trials  and fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of components and drug materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we record accruals for these preclinical study  clinical trial and manufacturing expenses based on the estimated amount of work completed 
all such costs are included in research and development expenses based on these estimates 
costs of setting up a preclinical study or clinical trial are expensed as the related services are performed 
costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are enrolled in the trial 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence and discussions with research organizations 
if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may  however  underestimate or overestimate activity levels associated with various preclinical studies and clinical trials at a given point in time 
in the event we underestimate  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
to the extent any of these expenses are reimbursable under our collaboration agreement with wyeth  we could also record significant adjustments to revenue when the actual activity becomes known 
to date  we have not made any material adjustments to our estimates of preclinical study and clinical trial expenses 
we make good faith estimates that we believe to be accurate  but the actual costs and timing of preclinical studies and clinical trials are highly uncertain  subject to risks  and may change depending on a number of factors  including our clinical development plan 
if any of our product candidates enter phase clinical trials  the process of 
table of contents estimating clinical trial costs will become more difficult because the trials will involve larger numbers of patients and clinical sites 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all future share based payments made to employees and directors be based on estimated fair values 
employee stock based compensation expense recognized in the years ended december   and was calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest  and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the forfeiture estimate is based on historical employee turnover rates and could differ from actual forfeitures 
compensation costs for employee stock options granted prior to january  were accounted for using the option s intrinsic value or the difference  if any  between the fair market value of our common stock and the exercise price of the option 
the fair value of each employee option grant in the years ended december   and  respectively  was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions year ended december  risk free interest rate weighted average expected life in years expected dividend yield expected volatility rate weighted average estimated fair value of employee options for stock options granted to non employees  the fair value of the stock options is estimated using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes model utilizes the estimated fair value of common stock and requires that  at the date of grant  we make assumptions with respect to the expected life of the option  the volatility of the fair value of its common stock  risk free interest rates and expected dividend yields of our common stock 
we have assumed that non employee stock options have an expected life of one to ten years and assumed common stock volatility between and 
stock based compensation expense is recognized over the period of expected service by the non employee 
as the service is performed  we are required to update our valuation assumptions  remeasure unvested options and record the stock based compensation using the valuation as of the vesting date 
these adjustments may result in higher or lower stock based compensation expense in the statement of operations than originally estimated 
changes in the market price of our stock could materially change the value of an option and the resulting stock based compensation expense 
we expect stock based compensation expense associated with non employee options to fluctuate in the future based on the volatility of our future stock price 
valuation of investments we carry our investments in debt securities at fair value  estimated as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
in accordance with our investment policy  we diversify our credit risk and invest in debt securities with high credit quality 
substantially all of our investments held as of december  are actively traded and our estimate of fair value is based upon quoted market prices 
to date  the carrying values of our investments have not been written down due to declines in value because such declines are judged to be other than temporary 
declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future 
table of contents operating results 
we will continue to monitor our credit risks and evaluate the potential need for impairment charges related to credit risks in future periods 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in september the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  released statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we adopted the provisions of sfas as of january   with respect to our financial assets and liabilities only 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in november  the fasb agreed to a one year deferral of the effective date for non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
we do not believe the adoption of the portion of the pronouncement covered by the deferral will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in june the eitf reached a final consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities  or eitf eitf requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities be deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
effective january   we adopted eitf for the year ended december   the adoption of eitf resulted in an increase in prepaid expenses and a decrease in research and development expenses of approximately million 
recent accounting pronouncements in november the eitf reached a final consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property  or eitf eitf will require us to disclose the nature and purpose of our collaborative arrangements in our annual financial statements  our rights and obligations under the collaborative arrangements  the stage of the underlying endeavors life cycle  our accounting policies for the arrangements and the income statement classification and amount of significant financial statement amounts related to the collaborative arrangements 
eitf will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and will require us to apply it as a change in accounting principle through retrospective application to all prior periods for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
we have evaluated the impact of adopting eitf on our financial statements and do not expect any impact on our results of operations or financial position 
results of operations for the years ended december   and revenue revenue decreased to million in from million in and from million in the decrease in compared to was due to a decrease in reimbursement revenue from the wyeth collaboration related to the phase b clinical trial for our lead product candidate  tru  in the treatment of ra  an extension of the recognition of the up front fee and a decline in reimbursable legal costs 
revenue for the year ended december  was comprised of million for collaborative research funding and million for recognition of the million up front fee 
the million up front fee is being recognized ratably over the estimated term of our substantive contractual obligations under the agreement and the related research and development service period  which is currently estimated to be seven years  or through december during the third quarter of  the estimated term of the research and development service period was adjusted from six years and three months to seven years  or through december this change in estimate reduced recognition of the up front fee during by  currently  our clinical development obligations under the agreement are limited to conducting ongoing re treatment studies for tru the ongoing second phase b study and future studies will be conducted by wyeth 
the estimated term of the research and development service period is reviewed and adjusted as additional information becomes available 

table of contents reimbursement revenue is expected to fluctuate in the future due to the timing of reimbursed legal and clinical development costs  and the recognition of the associated collaborative research revenue under the wyeth collaboration agreement 
our actual revenue  however  could differ materially from anticipated revenue 
the decrease in compared to was due to decreased milestone revenue  with million of milestone revenue recognized in and none in  reduced reimbursement revenue from the wyeth collaboration as a result of the successful transfer of manufacturing activities for tru from us to wyeth in  and decreased revenue related to an extension of the recognition period for the up front fee 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in reimbursable clinical costs related to our phase b clinical trial for tru revenue for the year ended december  was comprised of million for collaborative research funding and million for recognition of the million up front fee 
revenue in the year ended december  was comprised of million for collaborative research funding  million for recognition of the million up front fee and million for a milestone payment 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in the decrease in was primarily due to decreased outside manufacturing costs related to our tru product candidate  decreased clinical costs related to our phase b clinical trial for tru and decreased costs for lab expenses for tru we expect research and development expenses to increase in the future due to increased manufacturing and clinical development costs primarily related to our tru product candidate  as well as the advancement of our preclinical programs  and product candidate manufacturing costs 
this increase in research and development costs will be partially offset by our restructuring in february in connection with this restructuring  we estimate that we will incur a million charge in the first quarter of related to employee severance  benefits and outplacement services  million of which will be classified as research and development expense 
our actual research and development expenses could differ materially from those anticipated 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased clinical costs related to our phase b clinical trial for tru  increased personnel related expenses due to increased headcount  increased outside manufacturing costs related to our tru product candidate  increased lab supplies to support our research activities and increased facilities costs 
these increases were partially offset by lower outside manufacturing costs for tru due to the successful transfer of manufacturing activities to wyeth in the first quarter of and lower non cash stock based compensation charges 
at any time  we have many ongoing research projects 
our internal resources  employees and infrastructure are not directly tied to any individual research project and are typically deployed across multiple projects 
through our clinical development programs  we are developing each of our product candidates in parallel for multiple disease indications  and through our basic research activities  we are seeking to design potential drug candidates for multiple new disease indications 
due to the number of ongoing projects and our ability to utilize resources across several projects  we do not record or maintain information regarding the costs incurred for our research and development programs on a program specific basis 
in addition  we believe that allocating costs on the basis of time incurred by our employees does not accurately reflect the actual costs of a project 
our research and development activities can be divided into research and preclinical programs and clinical development programs 
the costs associated with research and preclinical programs and clinical development programs approximate the following in thousands year ended december  research and preclinical programs clinical development programs total research and development 
table of contents research and preclinical program costs consist of costs associated with our product development efforts  conducting preclinical studies  personnel costs  lab expenses and indirect costs such as rent  utilities and depreciation 
research and preclinical program costs decreased in compared to due to decreased lab expenses for tru as this program moved from a preclinical program to a clinical program 
research and preclinical program costs increased in compared to due to increased personnel related expenses due to increased headcount  increased lab supplies to support our research activities and increased facilities costs 
clinical development costs consist of clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial site and investigator fees  personnel costs and indirect costs such as rent  utilities and depreciation 
clinical development program costs decreased in compared to due to decreased outside manufacturing costs related to our tru product candidate and decreased clinical costs related to our phase b clinical trial for tru these costs were partially offset by expenses associated with the commencement of the phase clinical trial for tru in cll 
clinical development program costs decreased in compared to due to decreased outside manufacturing costs resulting from the successful transfer of manufacturing activities for tru to wyeth in the first quarter of this decrease was partially offset by higher clinical costs related to our phase b clinical trial for tru and outside manufacturing costs related to our tru program 
the majority of our research and development programs are at an early stage and may not result in any approved products 
product candidates that may appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a variety of reasons 
product candidates may be found to be ineffective or to cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to pass through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality 
as part of our business strategy  we may enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates and it is uncertain which of our product candidates may be subject to future collaborative arrangements 
the participation of a collaborative partner may accelerate the time to completion and reduce the cost to us of a product candidate or it may delay the time to completion and increase the cost to us due to the alteration of our existing strategy 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments  and the risks inherent in the development process  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when  or to what extent  we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
under our collaboration with wyeth  we are responsible for completing the phase a and b clinical trials of tru for ra 
in addition  we are responsible for conducting clinical studies for tru niche indications 
while we are currently focused on developing tru and other smip tm product candidates with wyeth and our tru product candidate  together with other smip tm product candidates that are outside of the collaboration  we will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as an ongoing assessment as to the product candidate s commercial potential and value to potential partners 
in addition  due to the limited availability of capital we may not be able to fund programs adequately  or at all 
we anticipate developing additional product candidates  which will also increase our research and development expenses in future periods 
we do not expect any of our current product candidates to be commercially available in major markets before  if at all 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased consulting and outside service fees and increased non cash stock based compensation expense partially offset by decreased fees related to filings for the protection of our intellectual property 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased personnel related expenses  increased consulting and outside service fees incurred in support of being a publicly traded company and increased fees related to filings for the protection 
table of contents of our intellectual property offset by decreased non cash stock based compensation expenses 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to decline in as a result of our restructuring during the first quarter of in connection with this restructuring  we estimate that we will incur a million charge in the first quarter of related to employee severance  benefits and outplacement services  million of which will be classified as general and administrative expense 
our actual general and administrative expenses are likely to fluctuate in the future and could differ materially from those anticipated 
net interest income net interest income decreased to million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in compared to was the result of a decline in interest rates and a decrease in our average cash and investment balance in compared to the increase in compared to was primarily the result of an increase in our average cash balance in compared to the increase in our average cash balance in was due to the net proceeds of our initial public offering and concurrent private placement to wyeth in october and payments received in under our wyeth collaboration 
we expect net interest income to decrease in the future as a result of a declining cash balance and the current interest rate environment 
income taxes since inception  we have incurred operating losses and  accordingly  have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of million 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of million 
if not utilized  the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire between and liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and a million receivable from wyeth for collaborative research funding 
in january  we received payment of a million up front fee in connection with our collaboration agreement with wyeth 
in october  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share for gross proceeds of million 
net proceeds from the initial public offering were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us 
we also received net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of common stock at per share in the concurrent private placement to wyeth 
we have received additional funding from asset based lease financings and interest earned on investments 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including obligations of us government agencies  high credit rating corporate borrowers and money market accounts 
we have no exposure to auction rate securities within our investment portfolio 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation 
operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  net cash used in operations during was primarily due to personnel related costs  clinical trial costs  legal and professional fees  lab supplies to support our research activities  facilities costs and administrative costs 
net cash used in operations during was primarily a result of personnel related costs  clinical trial costs  legal and professional fees  lab supplies to support our research activities  outside manufacturing costs  facilities costs and administrative costs incurred as a result of being a publicly traded company 
net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily the million up front fee received from wyeth in january  partially offset by operating costs 
we expect net cash used in operations to increase in the future as we continue to expand our clinical activities 
investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and net cash used in investing activities was million for the year 
table of contents ended december  investing activities consist primarily of purchases and sales of marketable securities and capital purchases 
purchases of property and equipment were million  million  and million in the years ended december    and  respectively 
we expect to continue to make investments in property and equipment in  however  to a lesser extent than in financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was  in the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  financing activities consisted primarily of million in proceeds under a new debt facility  offset by million in payments against pre existing equipment financing arrangements and  in other debt payments 
in  financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from an equipment financing arrangement of million 
in  financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds received from our initial public offering of million  net proceeds from our concurrent private placement to wyeth in october of million  as well as net proceeds from an equipment financing arrangement of million 
we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank  or svb  effective july   the terms of which provide for a million debt facility secured by a security interest in our assets  other than intellectual property  and used million of the proceeds from this debt facility to fully extinguish our obligations with comerica bank  or comerica  under our existing debt facility 
in conjunction with extinguishing our obligations under the comerica debt facility  we also terminated the comerica loan and security agreement and related interest rate swap agreement 
we incurred a fee of  in connection with the termination of the interest rate swap agreement  which is included in interest expense in the statements of operations for the year ended december  the full million available under the svb facility was drawn at closing and is payable in fixed equal payments of principal plus accrued interest at a fixed rate of based on an month amortization schedule with all principal and interest due july  the loan and security agreement with svb contains representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for credit facilities of this type 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the loan and security agreement as of december  the loan and security agreement could restrict our ability to  among other things  sell certain assets  engage in a merger or change in control transaction  incur debt  pay cash dividends  and make investments 
the loan and security agreement also contains events of default that are customary for credit facilities of this type  including payment defaults  covenant defaults  insolvency type defaults  and events of default relating to liens  judgments  material misrepresentations  and the occurrence of certain material adverse events 
in addition  the loan and security agreement with svb contains a material adverse change clause which may accelerate the maturity of the loan upon the occurrence of certain events 
we have no indication that we are in default of the material adverse change clause and no scheduled loan payments have accelerated as a result of this provision 
based on our current operating plans  we believe that our existing capital resources  together with interest thereon  will be sufficient to meet our financial obligations for at least the next months 
the key assumption underlying this estimate is that expenditures related to continued preclinical  manufacturing  and clinical development of our product candidates during this period will be within budgeted levels 
our forecast of the period of time that our financial resources will be adequate to support operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in the section of item a entitled risk factors 
in light of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates and the extent to which we enter into collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with product development 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the terms and timing of any additional collaborative or licensing agreements that we may establish  the ability to raise capital through strategic partnerships or in the debt equity markets  milestone payments projected to be received under the wyeth collaboration agreement  
table of contents the scope  rate of progress  results and costs of our preclinical testing  clinical trials  and other research and development activities  the number of programs we pursue  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending  and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates  the cost  timing  and outcomes of regulatory approvals  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products  or technologies 
we will need to raise additional funds to support our operations  and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
the capital markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for more than months 
in recent months  the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels 
the scope and extent of this disruption in the capital markets could make it difficult or impossible to raise additional capital in public or private capital markets until conditions stabilize 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay  scale back  or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic partnerships  or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
our future contractual obligations as of december  were as follows in thousands payments due by period total year years years thereafter notes payable including interest manufacturing commitment operating lease obligations total off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet arrangements  including the use of structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is primarily confined to our investment securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our objectives  we maintain a portfolio of investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
we have no exposure to auction rate securities within our investment portfolio 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and  due to their very short term nature  are subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure on our investment securities 
we actively monitor changes in interest rates 
we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
our principal interest rate exposure is to changes in us interest rates related to our investment securities 
to estimate the potential loss due to changes in interest rates  we performed a sensitivity analysis using the instantaneous adverse change in interest rates of basis points across the yield curve 
on this basis  we estimate the potential loss in fair value that would result from a hypothetical basis points increase in interest rates to be  as of december
