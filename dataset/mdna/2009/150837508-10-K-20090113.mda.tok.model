item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview cel sci s most advanced product  multikine  which is cleared for a phase iii clinical trial in the us and in canada  is being developed for the treatment of cancer 
it is the first of a new class of cancer immunotherapy drugs called immune simulators 
it simulates the activities of a healthy person s immune system  which battles cancer every day 
multikine is multi targeted  it is the only cancer immunotherapy that both kills cancer cells in a targeted fashion and activates the general immune system to destroy the cancer 
we believe multikine is the first immunotherapeutic agent being developed as a first line standard of care treatment for cancer and it is cleared for a global phase iii clinical trial in advanced primary previously untreated head and neck cancer patients 
multikine is a new type of immunotherapy in that it is a comprehensive immunotherapy  incorporating both active and passive immune activity 
a comprehensive immunotherapy most closely resembles the workings of the natural immune system in the sense that it works on multiple fronts in the battle against cancer 
a comprehensive immunotherapy causes a direct and targeted killing of the tumor cells and activates the immune system to produce a more robust and sustainable anti tumor response 
multikine is designed to target the tumor micro metastases that are mostly responsible for treatment failure 
the basic concept is to add multikine to the current cancer treatments with the goal of making the overall cancer treatment more successful 
phase ii data indicated that multikine treatment resulted in a substantial increase in the survival of patients 
the lead indication is advanced primary previously untreated head neck cancer about  new cases per annum 
since multikine is not tumor specific  it may also be applicable in many other solid tumors 
we believe multikine is the first immunotherapeutic agent being developed as a first line treatment for cancer 
it is administered prior to any other cancer therapy because that is the period when the anti tumor immune response can still be fully activated 
once the patient has had surgery or has received radiation and or chemotherapy  the immune system is severely weakened and is less able to mount an effective anti tumor immune response 
to date  other immunotherapies have been administered later in cancer therapy ie  after radiation  chemotherapy  surgery 
cel sci also owns a pre clinical technology called leaps ligand epitope antigen presentation system 
since inception  cel sci has financed its operations through the issuance of equity securities  convertible notes  loans and certain research grants 
cel sci s expenses will likely exceed its revenues as it continues the development of multikine and brings other drug candidates into clinical trials 
until such time as cel sci becomes profitable  any or all of these financing vehicles or others may be utilized to assist cel sci s capital requirements 
results of operations fiscal grant revenue and other decreased by  during the year ended september   compared to fiscal  due to the completion of the work funded by the grants 
the final grant ended on march  a training grant in the amount of  was received from the state of maryland during the year ended september  in addition  cel sci received rent on an office sublet during a portion of the fiscal year during the year ended september   research and development expenses increased by  compared to fiscal this increase was due to expenses relating to the preparation for the phase iii clinical trial on multikine 
during the year ended september   general and administrative expenses decreased by  compared to fiscal this change was primarily due to stock issued to consultants in approximately  and a reduction in the public relations and presentations approximately  from fiscal this reduction on stock and public relation costs was partially offset by an increase in filing fees approximately  insurance  and the implementation costs of sarbanes oxley requirements approximately 
interest income during the year ended september  decreased by  compared to fiscal the decrease was due to fewer funds available for investment 
this decrease was partially offset by interest income accrued on the deferred rent on the manufacturing facility approximately 
the gain on derivative instruments of  for the year ended september  was the result of the change in fair value of the series k notes and series k warrants during the year 
these gains were caused by fluctuations in the share price of cl sci s common stock 
the interest expense of  for the year ended september  was composed of three elements amortization of the series k discount  interest paid and accrued on the series k debt  and loan interest 
this is a decline of approximately  from the year ended september  due to the lower principal balance of series k notes 
fiscal grant revenues and other decreased by approximately  during the year ended september  compared to the previous year due to the completion of the grant in march during the year ended september   research and development expenses increased by approximately  compared to the year ended september  this increase was due to work on two new cel projects and the use of lab supplies in the preparation for the beginning of the phase iii trials on multikine 
during the year ended september   general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  compared to the year ended september  this change was primarily due to increased public relations  presentations and strategic consulting agreements approximately  additional accounting expenses relating to the valuation of the series k notes and warrants approximately  and  increased travel by cel sci s employees approximately 
during the year ended september   interest income increased by approximately  compared to the year ended september  due to interest earned on the funds received from the sale of the series k notes and the shares of common stock sold in april the gain on derivative instruments of approximately  for the year ended september   was the result of the change in fair value of the series k notes and warrants during the period 
the interest expense of approximately  for the year ended september  was composed of two elements amortization of the discounted series k notes approximately  and interest paid and accrued on the series k warrants approximately 
research and development expenses during the five years ended september  cel sci s research and development efforts involved multikine and leaps the table below shows the research and development expenses associated with each project during this five year period 
multikine      leaps   total    in january  fda gave the go ahead for the phase iii clinical trial which had earlier been cleared by the canadian regulatory agency  the biologics and genetic therapies directorate 
as explained in item of this report  as of september   cel sci was involved in a number of pre clinical studies with respect to its leaps technology 
as with multikine  cel sci does not know what obstacles it will encounter in future pre clinical and clinical studies involving its leaps technology 
consequently  cel sci cannot predict with any certainty the funds required for future research and clinical trials and the timing of future research and development projects 
cel sci s lead product  multikine  has been cleared for a global phase iii clinical trial in advanced primary previously untreated head and neck cancer patients 
cel sci is currently working on partnerships and joint ventures to finance the part of the phase iii clinical trial that is not currently funded by its partners 
once cel sci raises the necessary funding to begin the phase iii clinical trial  we will retain a clinical research organization to establish an accurate budget for the phase iii clinical trial 
clinical and other studies necessary to obtain regulatory approval of a new drug involve significant costs and require several years to complete 
the extent of cel sci s clinical trials and research programs are primarily based upon the amount of capital available to cel sci and the extent to which cel sci has received regulatory approvals for clinical trials 
the inability of cel sci to conduct clinical trials or research  whether due to a lack of capital or regulatory approval  will prevent cel sci from completing the studies and research required to obtain regulatory approval for any products which cel sci is developing 
without regulatory approval  cel sci will be unable to sell any of its products 
since all of cel sci s projects are under development  cel sci cannot predict when it will be able to generate any revenue from the sale of any of its products 
liquidity and capital resources cel sci has had only limited revenues from operations since its inception in march l cel sci has relied primarily upon proceeds realized from the public and private sale of its common and preferred stock and convertible notes to meet its funding requirements 
funds raised by cel sci have been expended primarily in connection with the acquisition of an exclusive worldwide license to  and later purchase of  certain patented and unpatented proprietary technology and know how relating to the human immunological defense system  patent applications  the repayment of debt  the continuation of research and development sponsored by cel sci  administrative costs and construction of laboratory facilities 
inasmuch as cel sci does not anticipate realizing revenues until such time as it enters into licensing arrangements regarding the technology and know how licensed to it which could take a number of years  cel sci is mostly dependent upon the proceeds from the sale of its securities to meet all of its liquidity and capital resource requirements 
cel sci s working capital at september  was  compared to  at september  the convertible debt of  and the short term loan of  repaid in november are the only debt that cel sci has outstanding 
during fiscal year  cash and cash equivalents decreased by approximately  over fiscal year net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately  and resulted primarily from the issuance of stock and was used for the new manufacturing facility and equipment purchases and patent costs 
cash used in investing activities totaled  the additional cost of the manufacturing facility totaled  and equipment purchases  most for the manufacturing facility  totaled  in addition  expenditures for patent costs during the fiscal year were  components of the cash used in operating activities  were the net loss of  and the cost of stock and options issued  options and warrants extended and repriced  to both employees and nonemployees of  the gain on derivative instruments of  and an additional deposit on the manufacturing facility  required by the contract were other major components of the cash used in operating activities 
in august  cel sci leased a building near baltimore  maryland 
the building  which consists of approximately  square feet  has been remodeled in accordance with cel sci s specifications so that it can be used by cel sci to manufacture multikine for cel sci s phase iii clinical trials and sales of the drug if approved by the fda 
the lease expires on october  and requires annual base rent payments of  during the year ending october  the annual base rent escalates each year thereafter at 
cel sci is also required to pay all real and personal property taxes  insurance premiums  maintenance expenses  repair costs and utilities 
the lease allows cel sci  at its election  to extend the lease for two ten year periods or to purchase the building at the end of the year lease 
the lease required cel sci to pay  towards the remodeling costs  which will be recouped by reductions in the annual base rent of  beginning in in december  cel sci was not in compliance with certain lease requirements ie  failure to pay an installment of base annual rent 
however  the landlord has not declared cel sci formally in default under the terms of the lease 
the landlord currently has the right to declare cel sci in default if cel sci fails to pay any installment of the base annual rent when such failure continues for a period of business days after cel sci s receipt of written notice thereof from the landlord  provided that if cel sci fails to pay any of the foregoing within business days more than two times in any twelve month period during the lease term  the landlord shall not be required to provide cel sci with any further notice and cel sci shall be deemed to be in default 
cel sci is currently in negotiation with the landlord for rent deferral on the lease in order to conserve its cash 
if we do not renegotiate the lease we plan to either get an additional loan from mr 
declara or use the equity line of credit to make the rent payments 
regulatory authorities prefer to see biologics  such as multikine  manufactured for commercial sale in the same facility used to produce dosages used in phase iii clinical trials since this arrangement helps to ensure that the drug lots used to conduct the clinical trials will be consistent with those that nay be subsequently sold commercially 
although some biotech companies outsource their manufacturing  this can prevent problems since biologics require intense manufacturing and process control 
with biologic products a minor change in manufacturing and process control can result in a major change in the final product 
good and consistent manufacturing and process control is critical and is best assured if the product is manufactured and controlled in the manufacturer s own facility by its own specially trained personnel 
on august   cel sci sold series k convertible notes  plus series k warrants  to independent private investors for  the notes bear interest annually at the greater of or month libor plus per year 
the notes are due and payable on august  and are secured and collateralized by substantially all of cel sci s assets 
interest is payable quarterly 
since march cel sci has been required to make monthly payments of  toward the principal amount of the notes 
if cel sci fails to make any interest or principal payment when due  the notes will become immediately due and payable 
at cel sci s election  and under certain conditions  cel sci may use shares of its common stock to make interest and principal payments 
at the holder s option the series k notes are convertible into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of 
if cel sci sells any additional shares of common stock  or any securities convertible into common stock at a price below the then applicable conversion price  the conversion price will be lowered to the price at which the shares were sold or the lowest price at which the securities are convertible  as the case may be 
if cel sci sells any additional shares of common stock  or any securities convertible into common stock at a price above the conversion price  but below the average closing price of cel sci s common stock over the five trading days prior to the sale of the shares  the conversion price will be lowered to a price determined by a formula contained in the notes 
the conversion price will also be proportionately adjusted in the event of any stock splits 
cel sci has filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission so that the shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the series k notes or the exercise of the series k warrants may be resold in the public market 
cel sci is required to keep the registration statement continuously effective until the shares covered by the registration statement have been sold or can be sold pursuant to rule k 
if cel sci fails to comply with this provision  cel sci will be required to pay damages to the holders of the notes 
at any time after august  any note holder will have the right to require cel sci to redeem all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the notes  plus all accrued but unpaid interest 
the series k warrants allow the holders to purchase up to  shares of cel sci s common stock at a price of per share at any time prior to february  the exercise price of the series k warrants  as well as the shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants  will be proportionately adjusted in the event of any stock splits 
if cel sci sells any additional shares of common stock  or any securities convertible into common stock at a price below the then applicable exercise price of the series k warrants  the warrant exercise price will be lowered to the price at which the shares were sold or the lowest price at which the securities are convertible  as the case may be 
if cel sci sells any additional shares of common stock or any securities convertible into common stock at a price above the exercise price but below the market price of cel sci s common stock  the exercise price of the series k warrants will be lowered to a price determined by a formula contained in the warrants 
as of september   series k notes in the principal amount of  had been converted into  shares of cel sci s common stock 
in addition  principal payments of  in cash and  in shares of common stock were made to the holders of the series k notes 
as of september  the outstanding principal balance on the series k notes was  in april cel sci raised  from the sale of  shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
the investors who purchased the shares also received warrants which entitle the holders to purchase  shares of cel sci s common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the warrants expire on march  as a result of the april financing  and in accordance with the terms of the series k notes and warrants  the conversion price of the series k notes was reduced to and the exercise price of the series k warrants was reduced to 
on august   cel sci sold  shares of common stock and  warrants in a private financing for  the shares were sold at  a significant premium over the closing price of cel sci s common stock on the date of sale 
each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of cel sci s common stock at a price of per share at any time prior to august  the shares have no registration rights 
clinical and other studies necessary to obtain regulatory approval of a new drug involve significant costs and require several years to complete 
the extent of cel sci s clinical trials and research programs are primarily based upon the amount of capital available to cel sci and the extent to which cel sci has received regulatory approvals for clinical trials 
the inability of cel sci to conduct clinical trials or research  whether due to a lack of capital or regulatory approval  will prevent cel sci from completing the studies and research required to obtain regulatory approval for any products which cel sci is developing 
without regulatory approval  cel sci will be unable to sell any of its products 
future capital requirements cel sci has two partners who have agreed to participate in and pay for part of the phase iii clinical trial for multikine 
however in light of the current capital market environment  cel sci believes it is prudent not to start the phase iii clinical trial until it has firm commitments in the form of partnerships and or money raised for a substantial amount of cash to support the phase iii clinical trial 
in the meantime  cel sci will operate at significantly reduced cash expenditure levels and additional cash may be raised by offering contract manufacturing services to the pharmaceutical industry in its new manufacturing facility 
cel sci expects that it will need to raise additional capital in fiscal year in the form of corporate partnerships and or equity financings to support its operations at its current rate 
cel sci is currently working towards a transaction which it expects to complete in fiscal which will finance its phase iii clinical trial of multikine 
cel sci believes that it will be able to obtain additional financing since multikine is a phase iii product designed to treat cancer  an area that pharmaceutical companies are increasingly targeting 
cel sci is working on a sale leaseback program for the equipment it owns which would provide cel sci approximately million in additional cash 
it is important to note that cel sci s expenditures for fiscal year included several very large non recurring expenses that amounted to several million dollars  mostly related to the build out of the manufacturing facility 
these expenses will not recur in fiscal year  thereby reducing cel sci s expenditures significantly 
beyond those savings cel sci has also made other very significant cuts in its expenditures and certain vendors have agreed to take common stock in lieu of cash payments 
in addition  cel sci has put in place a million equity line of credit see note 
with this equity line of credit in place cel sci believes it will have the required capital to continue operations into january however  if necessary cel sci can make further reductions in expenditures by a reduction in force or by implementation of a salary reduction program 
the company has determined that the convertible debt holders of the series k notes may require repayment of the entire remaining principal balance at any time after august  this debt can be paid in stock and may not require a cash payment 
in addition  in december  cel sci was not in compliance with certain lease requirements ie  failure to pay an installment of base annual rent 
however  the landlord has not declared cel sci formally in default under the terms of the lease 
the landlord currently has the right to declare cel sci in default if cel sci fails to pay any installment of the base annual rent when such failure continues for a period of business days after cel sci s receipt of written notice thereof from the landlord  provided that if cel sci fails to pay any of the foregoing within business days more than two times in any twelve month period during the lease term  the landlord shall not be required to provide cel sci with any further notice and cel sci shall be deemed to be in default 
cel sci is currently in negotiation with the landlord for rent deferral on the lease in order to conserve its cash 
if we do not renegotiate the lease we plan to either get an additional loan from mr 
declara or use the equity line of credit to make the rent payments 
in general  with the reduction in expenses and the million equity line in place  the company expects to have enough cash to continue operations through january if the debt holders do not exercise their put options and the landlord of their manufacturing facility does not issue a default notice 
the company s independent audit firm has issued an audit opinion that expresses doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern mainly due to continued losses from operations  the debt holders ability to exercise their put options  and the potential for the landlord to issue a default notice 
while there can be no assurance that the debt holders will not exercise their put option  and the landlord of the manufacturing facility will not issue a default notice  the company continues to work on solutions for additional financing and ways to reduce expenses 
the company has shown in the past that they are able to secure financing to continue operations 
however  there is no assurance to do so in the future 
other than funding operating losses  funding its research and development program  and paying its liabilities  cel sci does not have any material capital commitments 
material future liabilities as of september  are as follows contractual obligations 
del years ending september  total thereafter operating leases  employment contracts    del 
it should be noted that substantial funds will be needed for the clinical trial which will be necessary before cel sci will be able to apply to the fda for approval to sell any products which may be developed on a commercial basis throughout the united states 
in the absence of revenues  cel sci will be required to raise additional funds through the sale of securities  debt financing or other arrangements in order to continue with its research efforts 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available or be available on favorable terms 
ultimately  cel sci must complete the development of its products  obtain appropriate regulatory approvals and obtain sufficient revenues to support its cost structure 
since all of cel sci s projects are under development cel sci cannot predict with any certainty the funds required for future research and clinical trials  the timing of future research and development projects  or when it will be able to generate any revenue from the sale of any of its products 
cel sci s cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates on its certificates of deposit  and  to an immaterial extent  foreign currency exchange rates 
subsequent events on november   the company extended its licensing agreement for multikine with orient europharma 
the new agreement extends the multikine collaboration to also cover south korea  the philippines  australia and new zealand 
the licensing agreement initially focuses on the areas of head and neck cancer  nasopharyngeal cancer and potentially cervical cancer 
as part of this new agreement  orient europharma invested  in the company 
effective december   dr 
daniel zimmerman  the company s senior vice president of research  cellular immunology  and john cipriano  the company s senior vice president of regulatory affairs  have agreed to become consultants to the company on an as needed basis thereby ending their full time employment with the company 
the stock and options owned by these two individuals will fully vest on january  on december   cel sci entered into an equity line of credit agreement as a source of funding for cel sci 
for a two year period  the agreement allows cel sci  at its discretion  to sell up to million of cel sci s common stock at the volume weighted average price on the day of the drawdown  less 
cel sci may request a drawdown once every ten trading days  although cel sci is under no obligation to request any drawdowns under the equity line of credit 
the equity line of credit expires on january  in december and january cel sci maximilian de clara  cel sci s president and a director  loaned cel sci a total of  the loan bears interest at per year and is payable on march  critical accounting policies cel sci s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  certain accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgments by management 
as a result  the consolidated financial statements are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
these estimates are based on cel sci s historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the industry and information available from outside sources  as appropriate 
cel sci s significant accounting policies include patents patent expenditures are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over years 
in the event changes in technology or other circumstances impair the value or life of the patent  appropriate adjustment in the asset value and period of amortization is made 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset  and from disposition  is less than the carrying value of the asset 
the amount of the impairment loss is the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
stock options and warrants sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize expense associated with share based compensation arrangements  including employee stock options  using a fair value based option pricing model 
sfas no 
r applies to all transactions involving issuance of equity by a company in exchange for goods and services  including employees 
using the modified prospective transition method of adoption  cel sci reflects compensation expense in the financial statements beginning october  the modified prospective transition method does not require restatement of prior periods to reflect the impact of sfas no 
r 
as such  compensation expense is recognized for awards that were granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled on or after october  options to non employees are accounted for in accordance with fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issue accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
accordingly  compensation is recognized when goods or services are received and is measured using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes model requires cel sci s management to make assumptions regarding the fair value of the options at the date of grant and the expected life of the options 
asset valuations and review for potential impairments cel sci reviews its fixed assets  intangibles and deferred rent every fiscal quarter 
this review requires that cel sci make assumptions regarding the value of these assets and the changes in circumstances that would affect the carrying value of these assets 
if such analysis indicates that a possible impairment may exist  cel sci is then required to estimate the fair value of the asset and  as deemed appropriate  expense all or a portion of the asset 
the determination of fair value includes numerous uncertainties  such as the impact of competition on future value 
cel sci believes that it has made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether its long lived assets have been impaired  however  if there is a material change in the assumptions used in its determination of fair values or if there is a material change in economic conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  cel sci could be required to recognize certain impairment charges in the future 
as a result of the reviews  no changes in asset values were required 
prepaid expenses and laboratory supplies the majority of prepaid expenses consist of bulk purchases of laboratory supplies used on a daily basis in the lab and items that will be used for future production 
the items in prepaid expenses are expensed when used in production or daily activity as research and development expenses 
these items are disposables and consumables and can be used for both the manufacturing of multikine for clinical studies and in the laboratory for quality control and bioassay use 
they can be used in training  testing and daily laboratory activities 
other prepaid expenses are payments for services over a long period and are expensed over the time period for which the service is rendered 
derivative instruments cel sci enters into financing arrangements that consist of freestanding derivative instruments or are hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivative features 
cel sci accounts for these arrangement in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
and emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  eitf  as well as related interpretations of these standards 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  derivative instruments and hybrid instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and are measured at fair value with gains or losses recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the derivative or hybrid instruments 
embedded derivatives that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract are bifurcated and recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either a gain or loss in earnings if they can be reliably measured 
when the fair value of embedded derivative features cannot be reliably measured  cel sci measures and reports the entire hybrid instrument at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either a gain or loss in earnings 
cel sci determines the fair value of derivative instruments and hybrid instruments based on available market data using appropriate valuation models  giving consideration to all of the rights and obligations of each instrument and precluding the use of blockage discounts or premiums in determining the fair value of a large block of financial instruments 
fair value under these conditions does not necessarily represent fair value determined using valuation standards that give consideration to blockage discounts and other factors that may be considered by market participants in establishing fair value

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by  for example  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
cel sci enters into financing arrangements that are or include freestanding derivative instruments or that are or include hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivative features 
cel sci does not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
additional information is presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of these instruments is affected primarily by volatility of the trading prices of the cel sci s common stock
