this discussion and analysis of the financial statements and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements  including the related notes thereto  contained elsewhere in this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and accounting for goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the accounting policies below as the policies critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized in a multiple element arrangement when company specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement 
at the outset of the arrangement with the customer  we defer revenue for the fair value of our undelivered elements eg  maintenance based on company specific objective evidence of the amount such items are sold individually to our customers and recognize revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered in the arrangement eg  software license when the basic criteria in sop have been met 
under sop  revenue attributable to an element in a customer arrangement is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and delivery has occurred  provided the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and the arrangement does not require significant customization of the software 
if  at the outset of the customer arrangement  we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we defer the revenue and recognize the revenue when the arrangement fee becomes due and payable 
service revenue relates primarily to consulting services  maintenance and training 
maintenance revenue is initially deferred and then recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  typically months 
consulting and training revenue is recognized as the services are performed and is usually calculated on a time and materials basis 
such services primarily consist of implementation services related to the installation of our products and do not include significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 
we do not have price protection programs  conditional acceptance agreements  and sales of our products are made without right of return 
for contracts that require significant modification or customization to the software in accordance with customers specifications  we recognize revenue using the completed contract method pursuant to the requirements of statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
under this method  revenue and expenses are deferred until customer acceptance of the finished product occurs 

table of contents goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and at least annually 
factors we consider to be important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  timing of our revenue  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill  but test for goodwill impairment following a two step process 
the first step is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
currently  we have one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of enterprise fair value are currently based on our stock price as reported by nasdaq given our single reporting unit structure 
no impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods presented as the enterprise faire value significantly exceeded carrying value 
due to the current adverse global economic conditions  we continue to monitor the fair value of our reporting unit to identify any potential goodwill impairment 
employee stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of stock based awards using a black scholes valuation model 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating volatility  expected terms  and forfeitures 
volatility is estimated based on historical experience 
expected terms are based on historical experience and consideration of the awards contractual terms  vesting schedule and future expectations 
forfeitures are based on actual forfeiture rate as well as management judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
see footnote in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes according to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of the assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
developments such as case law  changes in tax law  new rulings or regulations issued by taxing authorities  and interactions with the taxing authorities could affect whether a position should be recognized or the amount that should be reported 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data in total dollars  as a percentage of total net revenues and as a percentage change from the same period in the prior year 
cost of license revenues and cost of service revenues are expressed as a percentage of the related revenues 
this information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k

table of contents revenue net revenue 
our revenue is derived principally from two sources fees from software licensing and fees for post contract technical support 
we license our software primarily on a per cpu  per server  per port or per user basis 
therefore  the addition of cpu s  servers  ports or users to existing systems increases our revenue from our installed base of licenses 
similarly  the reduction of cpu s  servers  ports or users to existing systems decreases our revenue from our installed base of licenses 
the timing of orders and customer ordering patterns have resulted in fluctuations in license revenue between quarters and year to year 
total revenue decreased million or from fiscal year to fiscal year  primarily due to lower orders of licenses and non renewal of support services from our existing customer base as a result of the current adverse global economic conditions 
the increase in license revenue from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily a result of increased users added to our current customer base 
we anticipate that revenue will continue to be adversely affected until global economic conditions improve 
we have been actively developing and marketing our tigerlogic product line 
should our development efforts and the adoption of these product lines be successful  we anticipate additional revenues in future periods related to these products 
however  we can give no assurances as to customer acceptance of any new products or services  or the ability of the current or any new products and services to generate revenue 
while we are committed to research and development efforts that are intended to allow us to penetrate new markets and generate new sources of revenue  such efforts may not result in additional products  services or revenue 
operating expenses cost of license revenue 
cost of license revenue is comprised of direct costs associated with software license sales including software packaging  documentation  physical media costs and royalties 
cost of license revenue for fiscal year remained consistent with fiscal year the slight decrease in absolute dollars for cost of license revenue for fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  is due to decreased royalties 
the decrease in cost of license revenue in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year is due to reduced headcount 
cost of service revenue 
cost of service revenue includes primarily personnel costs relating to providing consulting  technical support and training services 
the decrease in cost of service revenue for fiscal year  when compared to fiscal year  was due to reduced headcount and effect of foreign exchange rate relating to our uk subsidiary s costs 
the decrease in cost of service revenue in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is due to reduced headcount 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries  benefits  advertising  tradeshows  travel and overhead costs for our sales and marketing personnel 
selling and marketing expense for fiscal year decreased million or when compared to fiscal year this decrease was mainly due to lower consulting expense and lower marketing expense this year as compared to prior year 
the increase of million in selling and marketing expense in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is due primarily to higher marketing expense for the tigerlogic yolink formerly chunkit product line 
we anticipate that selling and marketing costs related to the tigerlogic product line may increase as we further develop the sales channel for these products and if customer acceptance of these products increases 
in addition  if our continued research and development efforts are successful  including with respect to our tigerlogic product line  and new products or services are created  we may incur increased sales and marketing expense to promote those new products in future periods 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses and overhead costs for engineering personnel including employees in the us and the uk and contractors in the us 
research and development expense for fiscal year decreased million or when compared to fiscal year mainly due to lower headcount  lower recruiting expense and effect of foreign exchange rate relating to our uk subsidiary s costs 
this decrease is partially offset by higher stock compensation expense due to additional options granted this year 
the decrease of million in research and development in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is primarily due to a decrease in salary related expenses of million as a result of reduced headcount  and a decrease in consulting expense of million due to the termination of consulting contracts in the us and india 
we are committed to our research and development efforts and expect research and development expense will remain at the current level in future periods or increase if we believe that additional spending is warranted 
such efforts may not result in additional new products and any new products  including the tigerlogic product line  may not generate sufficient revenue  if any  to offset the research and development expense 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of costs associated with our finance  human resources  legal and other administrative functions 
these costs consist principally of salaries and other personnel related expenses  professional fees  depreciation and overhead costs 
general and administrative expense for fiscal year increased million or over fiscal year this increase in general and administrative expense was mainly due to severance costs of approximately million relating to the separation from employment of the former chief executive officer  costs incurred in legal services related to pending litigation matters and patents and trademarks registration for our yolink product  and higher stock expense due to additional options granted this year 
this increase was partially offset by lower external consulting expense incurred in the initial year of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and the adoption of fin in the prior year 

table of contents the increase of million in general and administrative expense in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is primarily due to million increase in legal expense relating to outstanding legal proceedings and intellectual property matters 
we also incurred million of additional expenses in fiscal year due primarily to sarbanes oxley compliance and the adoption of fin other income expense 
other income expense consists primarily of net interest expense and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
other income expense for fiscal year decreased to million expense from million income in fiscal year the change in other income expense during year end march   as compared to march   was mainly due to foreign exchange losses resulting from a significant intercompany balance outstanding denominated in british pound  which has been deteriorating significantly against the us dollar in the current year  resulting in an increase in foreign currency loss of approximately million in the current fiscal year as compared to prior fiscal year  and lower interest income due to lower interest rates offered by the company s conservative investment strategies 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  due to uncertain economic environment relating to the banking industry  the company converted all outstanding money market fund investments in government issued securities into cash 
therefore  no interest income was earned from our cash balance during the fourth quarter of fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal year  cam small cap fund  lp cam converted its subordinated convertible note to equity 
this conversion resulted in a decrease in our interest expense during fiscal other expense decreased million or during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to higher interest income as a result of higher investment balances  lower interest expense as a result of the conversion of astoria capital partners  lp astoria and gfam hedge partnership gfam subordinated convertible notes to equity  and favorable exchange rates 
due to the uncertainty in exchange rates  we may experience transaction gains or losses in future periods  the effect of which cannot be predicted at this time 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was   and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes reflects tax on earnings and dividends from foreign subsidiaries  tax benefits related to certain state income tax filings  and the refundable research and development credit 
due to uncertainties surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of the net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits in the future  we carry a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in domestic and foreign jurisdictions  except france 
in prior year  as a result of our analysis of all available evidence  both positive and negative as of the end of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march   including sustained historical profitability in france  improved financial condition at the parent level  and completion of a world wide transfer pricing study  it was considered more likely than not that a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in france was not required  resulting in the release of the valuation allowance previously recorded against our net french deferred tax assets of in july  the housing assistance act of introduced a refundable research and development credit refund that could be claimed in lieu of special bonus depreciation as enacted by the economic stimulus act of based on our analysis for fiscal year  we expect the adoption of the housing assistance act of to result in a cash refund of approximately  this amount has been included in the provision for income taxes for fiscal year on october   as part of the emergency economic stabilization act of  the us federal research and development credit was retroactively extended to include qualifying expenditures paid or incurred from january  through december  as a result of this new legislation  we expect to generate us federal research and development tax credits for the fiscal year ending march  resulting in additional tax credit carryovers 
however  this credit did not have an impact on our financial statements for the fiscal year ending march  as we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of march  on february   the state of california passed a new law to allow taxpayers to make an election to adopt a single sales factor apportionment formula starting with the taxable year 
as of march   the company has not considered changing its sales factor apportionment in california 
should the company decide to make an election in using a single sales factor  the company will need to adjust the blended state rate used to tax effect its deferred tax assets liabilities  and record any impact to the financial statements in the period such decision is made 
liquidity and capital resources in connection with the acquisition of pickax  we assumed a secured promissory note issued to astoria dated november   in the amount of million 
in january  we entered into a note exchange agreement the exchange agreement with astoria to replace the existing secured promissory note  as amended  with a convertible subordinated note 
under the terms of the exchange agreement  the secured promissory note was exchanged and replaced with a convertible subordinated note having a principal amount of million  which principal amount was equal to the outstanding principal and accrued interest payable on the secured promissory note as of the date of the exchange agreement 
in october  astoria assigned a portion of its common stock holdings totaling  shares and a portion of the subordinated convertible note  totaling  to two of its limited partners  gfam and cam 
as such  we issued an amended and restated convertible subordinated note to astoria for  and convertible subordinated notes directly to gfam and cam for  and  respectively 
the convertible subordinated notes were convertible into common stock at any time  at the option of the holder  at a price of per share 
the convertible subordinated notes matured on may   extending the may  maturity date of the secured promissory note 

table of contents the interest rate of the convertible subordinated notes was per annum as compared to an interest rate of per annum under the secured promissory note 
the interest was payable quarterly at our option in cash or through increases to the outstanding principal of the convertible subordinated notes 
on december   we entered into an agreement regarding amended and restated common stock purchase warrant and convertible subordinated note due with astoria whereby we could redeem  in part  the convertible subordinated note in advance of january  on december   astoria exercised its warrant in the amount of  in lieu of a cash payment  we used the proceeds of the exercise to pay down a portion of the indebtedness to astoria 
the pay down consisted of  for accrued and unpaid interest  and  as a reduction of principal of the convertible subordinated note 
on october   the company received a conversion notice from astoria and on october   the company received a conversion notice from gfam  each electing to convert its convertible subordinated note in full 
as a result   of outstanding principal owed to astoria under its convertible subordinate note was converted into  shares of the company s common stock  and  of outstanding principal owed to gfam under its convertible subordinated note was converted into  shares of the company s common stock 
per the terms of the convertible subordinated notes  the company made a cash payment to astoria and gfam of approximately  and  respectively  for amounts outstanding under the convertible subordinated notes that were not converted into shares of common stock 
following the conversion of such convertible subordinated notes and the cash payment to astoria and gfam  the convertible subordinated notes held by astoria and gfam were cancelled 
after the conversion by astoria and gfam  only cam s convertible subordinated note remained outstanding 
on april   the company received a conversion notice from cam on april  electing to convert its convertible subordinated note in full 
as a result   of outstanding principal owed to cam under its convertible subordinated note was converted into  shares of the company s common stock

as of march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements for the remainder of the fiscal year ending march  and through the foreseeable future 
we are committed to research and development and marketing efforts that are intended to allow us to penetrate new markets and generate new sources of revenue and improve operating results 
however  our research and development and marketing efforts have required  and will continue to require  cash outlays without the immediate or short term receipt of related revenue 
our ability to meet our expenditure requirements is dependent upon our future financial performance  which will be affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  our ability to penetrate new markets and attract new customers  market acceptance of our new and existing products and services  the success of research and development efforts and other factors beyond our control 
on november   we entered into a lease agreement with the irvine company whereby we leased one building in irvine  california  comprising approximately  square feet  to replace our then headquarters facility 
the lease commenced in november and has a five year term 
if certain conditions are met  we have the option to extend the term of the lease for an additional thirty six months 
the total basic rent over the five year term is approximately million  which represents a lower per square foot cost than our prior property lease 
the annual basic rent during the five year term ranges from approximately  during the first year to approximately  during the fifth year 
the rent expense is being recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term 
we had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of march  net cash used by operating activities was million for fiscal year ended march   net cash provided in operating activities was million for fiscal year ended march   and net cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal years ended the increase in net cash used in operating activities for the twelve months ended march  as compared to the same period in prior year was primarily due to lower revenue even though operating expenses decreased 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal years ended march   and  
table of contents respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities was due to higher expenditures related to equipment purchased relating to our yolink product 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to proceeds derived from the exercise of stock options and corresponding issuance of common stock 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet liabilities or transactions as of march  contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligation as of march   and the effect such obligation is expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating leases non gaap financial information earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is defined as net income loss with an add back for depreciation and amortization  non cash stock based compensation expense  interest income expense net  other income expense net  and income taxes 
ebitda should not be construed as a substitute for net loss or as a better measure of liquidity than cash flow from operating activities  which are determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
ebitda excludes components that are significant in understanding and assessing our results of operations and cash flows 
ebitda does not represent funds available for management s discretionary use and is not intended to represent cash flow from operations 
in addition  ebitda is not a term defined by gaap and as a result our measure of ebitda might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
however  ebitda is used by management to evaluate  assess and benchmark our operational results and we believe that ebitda is relevant and useful information  which is often reported and widely used by analysts  investors and other interested parties in our industry 
accordingly  we are disclosing this information to permit a more comprehensive analysis of our operating performance  to provide an additional measure of performance and liquidity and to provide additional information with respect to our ability to meet future debt service  capital expenditure and working capital requirements 

table of contents our ebitda were negative million or negative of total net revenue  positive million or of total net revenue  negative million or negative of total net revenue  for the years ended march   and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal ebitda as compared to fiscal was a result of decreased revenue 
the increase in fiscal ebitda as compared to fiscal was a result of higher revenue and lower research and development expenses
