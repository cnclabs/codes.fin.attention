from a cash flow perspective  we generated  in cash flow from operating activities and increased our cash balance by  to  despite significantly reduced sales and earnings during the back half of fiscal retail net revenues in fiscal decreased by  or  over fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the downturn in the economic environment during fiscal resulting in a comparable store sales decrease of  the impact of the extra week of net revenues in fiscal a week year of approximately  and the temporary and permanent closure of stores and stores  respectively 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in our store leased square footage of including new store openings and the remodeling or expansion of an additional stores 
net revenue decreases were led by the pottery barn  williams sonoma and pottery barn kids brands  partially offset by net revenue increases in the west elm brand 
in our direct to customer channel  net revenues in fiscal decreased by  or  over fiscal this decrease was primarily driven by the downturn in the overall economic environment during fiscal  the impact of the extra week of net revenues in fiscal a week year of approximately  and a decrease in catalog and page circulation of and  respectively 
declining net revenues in the pottery barn and pottery barn kids brands were the primary contributors to the year over year net revenue decrease 
all brands except pbteen had declining net revenues during fiscal in our core brands  net revenues decreased by over fiscal driven by net revenue decreases in the pottery barn and pottery barn kids brands primarily due to the downturn in the economic environment in the back half of fiscal  the impact of our catalog circulation optimization strategy and the impact of the extra week of net revenues in fiscal a week year 
comparable store sales decreases were and for the pottery barn and pottery barn kids brands  respectively 
although net revenues decreased in the williams sonoma brand  it proved to be more resilient than our other core brands  ending the year with a comparable store decrease of only 
similar to our core brands  our emerging brands including west elm  pbteen and williams sonoma home were also impacted by the downturn in the economic environment  where net revenues decreased from fiscal primarily due to a decrease in the williams sonoma home brand in both the retail and direct to customer channels 
this net revenue decrease was partially offset by increases in both the pbteen and west elm brands 
pbteen was our best performing brand during the year with net revenue growth of 
new product innovation and superior execution drove this year over year increase 
although overall net revenues increased year over year  we did begin to see net revenue decreases in the back half of the year 
we do  however  continue to be excited about the long term growth potential of the brand as it solidifies its positioning in the pottery barn portfolio of brands 
although west elm continued to be more resilient than our other home furnishings brands with increased net revenues in fiscal  we saw net revenue decreases in the back half of fiscal due to lower transactions and conversion rates 
despite these declines  we continued to expand the reach of the brand by opening nine new stores during the year  including our first west elm stores in puerto rico and canada  and are planning to open four additional stores in fiscal 
table of contents in the williams sonoma home brand  we believe the customer has been particularly impacted by the macro economic environment and that these trends are likely to continue for the foreseeable future 
given the brands performance to date and the fixed cost pressure from underperforming retail stores  we are working with our landlords on potential store closings and we will continue to assess the brand s overall market potential in this economic environment as we progress throughout the year 
fiscal operational results during fiscal  though we faced a difficult economic environment  we were able to make significant progress against several key initiatives  including successfully amending our unsecured credit facilities and ending the year with significant cushions in the financial covenants on these facilities  reducing our year end inventory levels by  or  initiating and implementing a  infrastructure cost reduction program  and optimizing profitability through aggressive expense management and highly controlled promotional activity 
in our supply chain  we continued to make significant progress on our key initiatives  including restructuring our asian furniture sourcing network to establish in country expertise and improved vendor performance  expanding our us upholstered furniture operations to provide shorter lead times  better quality  and lower cost  and in sourcing six of our largest local furniture delivery hubs to improve customer service and reduce returns  replacements  and damages expense 
we also reduced distribution capacity due to substantial improvements in inventory management 
in information technology  we continued the rollout of our direct to customer order management system 
this is a phased implementation that is improving efficiency and functionality in an area that we believe still has significant cost and inventory planning opportunities 
in the customer insights area  we implemented new functionality that is allowing us to significantly improve the relevancy of our marketing contacts and optimize our catalog response rates 
in e commerce  we completed the migration of all of our websites to our next generation platform  with the exception of west elm  which will be transitioned in fiscal we also began testing new functionality in the areas of click to call  product reviews  and search 
infrastructure was also a key area of investment this year  including the replacement of our company wide point of sale hardware and the rollout of electronic signature and pin debit functionality in our stores 
in direct marketing  we reduced catalog advertising costs by an estimated  based on the success of our catalog circulation optimization strategy 
at the same time  we continued to aggressively explore additional traffic drivers through paid and natural search  target driven direct response and affiliate programs 
while we are still in the early phases of these rollouts  all of these initiatives have driven increased transactions and incremental sales to the brands 
fiscal as we enter fiscal  though we do expect a continued net revenue decline of to  due to the continuing effects of the economic downturn  we are focused on the aspects of the business that we can control  including the following three key initiatives optimizing our brand positioning and marketing strategies in a reset economy  improving profitability  and strengthening our balance sheet 
to optimize our brand positioning  we plan to continue evolving our merchandise assortment and placing a greater emphasis on opening price points and the value proposition 
we also plan to continue making superior customer service our top priority 
to optimize our marketing strategies  we plan to continue our catalog circulation optimization strategy and to shift advertising dollars from catalog to e commerce  our most profitable channel 
we also plan to continue to identify new opportunities to build brand awareness and customer engagement through search  e mail modeling  affiliate programs  and enhanced functionality 

table of contents to improve profitability  our most significant initiative is the  infrastructure cost reduction program we implemented in january 
we also plan to realize increased productivity from our catalog circulation optimization strategy  which we expect will drive additional advertising cost reductions 
in addition  we expect to realize an increase in our selling gross margin due to fewer markdowns and lower inventory levels  as well as additional savings from our furniture returns  replacements  and damages initiatives 
further  to strengthen our balance sheet  we plan to optimize cash flow through aggressive inventory management and lower capital spending  where we expect to reduce merchandise inventories by to over fiscal and decrease gross capital spending from  in fiscal to an estimated  to  in fiscal from a leased square footage perspective  we are only proceeding with new and remodeled stores that we are already committed to 
therefore  net of store closings  retail leased square footage is only expected to increase approximately and  to the extent possible  we will reduce this number further as we work with landlords to close underperforming stores 
finally  in fiscal  we expect to continue to return excess capital to our shareholders as reflected by the approval of a quarterly cash dividend of per common share by our board of directors in march

comparable store sales comparable stores are defined as those stores in which gross square footage did not change by more than in the previous months and which have been open for at least consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days 
by measuring the year over year sales of merchandise in the stores that have a history of being open for a full comparable months or more  we can better gauge how the core store base is performing since it excludes new store openings  store remodelings and expansions 
comparable stores exclude new retail concepts until such time as we believe that comparable store results in those concepts are meaningful to evaluating the performance of the retail strategy

among other things  weather conditions can affect comparable store sales because inclement weather can alter consumer behavior or require us to close certain stores temporarily and thus reduce store traffic 
even if stores are not closed  many customers may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather 
these factors have caused our comparable store sales to fluctuate significantly in the past on an annual  quarterly and monthly basis and  as a result  we expect that comparable store sales will continue to fluctuate in the future

in august  we renewed this lease for an additional two year period and the lease now expires in august in january  in connection with our infrastructure cost reduction program  we closed this distribution facility and vacated the property as of february  we do  however  continue to be liable for future rental payments under our lease agreement through the end of the lease term in august therefore  we have recorded a liability for all contractual future obligations within our consolidated balance sheet as of february  in may  we entered into an agreement to lease a  square foot distribution facility located in south brunswick  new jersey 
the lease has an initial term of two years  with two optional two year renewals 
in may  we exercised our option under the lease agreement to renew the agreement for an additional two year period 
the lease now expires in june in september  we entered into a year agreement to lease  square feet of distribution facility space in city of industry  california 
as of february   we were occupying  square feet of this facility and  in february  we began occupying the remaining  square feet 

table of contents during fiscal  we entered into lease agreements in florida and north carolina for storage space associated with the additional insourcing of our furniture delivery hubs within the region and for the purpose of a small manufacturing facility 
we are party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters 
these contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts  operating leases  trademarks  intellectual property  financial agreements and various other agreements 
under these contracts  we may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties or personal injury matters 
the terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined 
historically  we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications 
we believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters  the loss would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
consolidation of memphis based distribution facilities our memphis based distribution facilities include an operating lease entered into in july for a distribution facility in memphis  tennessee 
the lessor is a general partnership partnership comprised of w 
howard lester  our chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer and james a 
mcmahan  a director emeritus and a significant shareholder 
partnership does not have operations separate from the leasing of this distribution facility and does not have lease agreements with any unrelated third parties 
partnership financed the construction of this distribution facility through the sale of a total of  of industrial development bonds in and annual principal payments and monthly interest payments are required through maturity in december the partnership industrial development bonds are collateralized by the distribution facility and the individual partners guarantee the bond repayments 
as of february    was outstanding under the partnership industrial development bonds 
we made annual rental payments in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal of approximately  plus interest on the bonds calculated at a variable rate determined monthly approximately as of february   applicable taxes  insurance and maintenance expenses 
although the current term of the lease expires in august  we are obligated to renew the operating lease on an annual basis until these bonds are fully repaid 
our other memphis based distribution facility includes an operating lease entered into in august for another distribution facility that is adjoined to the partnership facility in memphis  tennessee 
the lessor is a general partnership partnership comprised of w 
howard lester  james a 
mcmahan and two unrelated parties 
partnership does not have operations separate from the leasing of this distribution facility and does not have lease agreements with any unrelated third parties 
partnership financed the construction of this distribution facility and related addition through the sale of a total of  of industrial development bonds in and quarterly interest and annual principal payments are required through maturity in august the partnership industrial development bonds are collateralized by the distribution facility and require us to maintain certain financial covenants 
as of february    was outstanding under the partnership industrial development bonds 
we made annual rental payments of approximately   and  plus applicable taxes  insurance and maintenance expenses in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
although the current term of the lease expires in august  we are obligated to renew the operating lease on an annual basis until these bonds are fully repaid 
the two partnerships described above qualify as variable interest entities under fin r due to their related party relationship to us and our obligation to renew the leases until the bonds are fully repaid 
accordingly  the two related party variable interest entity partnerships  from which we lease our memphis based distribution facilities  are consolidated by us 
as of february   our consolidated balance sheet includes  in assets primarily buildings   in debt and  in other long term liabilities 

table of contents impact of inflation the impact of inflation on our results of operations for the past three fiscal years has not been significant 
in light of the current economic environment  however  we cannot be certain of the effect inflation or deflation may have on our results of our operations in the future 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories  net of an allowance for excess quantities and obsolescence  are stated at the lower of cost weighted average method or market 
to determine if the value of our inventory should be marked down below cost  we consider current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
our inventory value is adjusted periodically to reflect current market conditions  which requires management judgments that may significantly affect the ending inventory valuation  as well as gross margin 
the significant estimates used in inventory valuation are obsolescence including excess and slow moving inventory and lower of cost or market reserves and estimates of inventory shrinkage 
we reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends  aging reports  specific identification and our estimates of future retail sales prices 
reserves for shrinkage are estimated  at the concept and channel level  as a percentage of net sales based on historical shrinkage results  expectations of future shrinkage and current inventory levels 
actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based on the results of our physical inventory count and can vary from our estimates due to such factors as changes in operations within our distribution centers  the mix of our inventory which ranges from large furniture to small tabletop items and execution against loss prevention initiatives in our stores  off site storage locations  and our third party transportation providers 
due to these factors  our obsolescence and shrinkage reserves contain uncertainties 
both estimates have calculations that require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including market conditions  the selling environment  historical results and current inventory trends 
if actual obsolescence or shrinkage estimates change from our original estimate  we will adjust our reserves accordingly 
management does not believe that changes in the assumptions used in these estimates would have a significant effect on our inventory balances 
we have made no material changes to our assumptions included in the calculations of the obsolescence and shrinkage reserves 
in addition  we do not believe a change in our inventory reserves would have a material effect on net earnings 
as of february  and february   our inventory reserves were  and  respectively 
advertising and prepaid catalog expenses advertising expenses consist of media and production costs related to catalog mailings  e commerce advertising and other direct marketing activities 
all advertising costs are expensed as incurred  or upon the release of the initial advertisement  with the exception of prepaid catalog expenses 
prepaid catalog expenses consist primarily of third party incremental direct costs  including creative design  paper  printing  postage and mailing costs for all of our direct response catalogs 
such costs are capitalized as prepaid catalog expenses and are amortized over their expected period of future benefit 
such amortization is based upon the ratio of actual revenues to the total of actual and estimated future revenues on an individual catalog basis 
estimated future revenues are based upon 
table of contents various factors such as the total number of catalogs and pages circulated  the probability and magnitude of consumer response and the assortment of merchandise offered 
each catalog is generally fully amortized over a six to nine month period  with the majority of the amortization occurring within the first four to five months 
prepaid catalog expenses are evaluated for realizability on a monthly basis by comparing the carrying amount associated with each catalog to the estimated probable remaining future profitability remaining net revenues less merchandise cost of goods sold  selling expenses and catalog related costs associated with that catalog 
if the catalog is not expected to be profitable  the carrying amount of the catalog is impaired accordingly 
property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we review the carrying value of all long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we review for impairment all stores for which current or projected cash flows from operations are either negative or nominal  or the construction costs are significantly in excess of the amount originally expected 
impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the lease 
our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term typically to years is based upon our experience  historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability and economic conditions 
the future estimates of store profitability and economic conditions require estimating such factors as sales growth  gross margin  employment rates  lease escalations  inflation on operating expenses and the overall economics of the retail industry for up to years in the future  and are therefore subject to variability and difficult to predict 
if a long lived asset is found to be impaired  the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the net carrying value and the asset s fair value 
the fair value is estimated based upon future cash flows discounted at a rate that is commensurate with the risk and approximates our weighted average cost of capital 
we recorded impairment charges related to our underperforming retail stores of   and  in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding property and equipment 
self insured liabilities we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  employee health benefits and product and general liability claims 
we record self insurance liabilities based on claims filed  including the development of those claims  and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
factors affecting this estimate include future inflation rates  changes in severity  benefit level changes  medical costs and claim settlement patterns 
should a different amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or costs of the claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated  reserves may need to be adjusted accordingly 
we determine our workers compensation liability and product and general liability claims reserves based on an actuarial analysis of historical claims data 
self insurance reserves for employee health benefits  workers compensation and product and general liability claims were  and  as of february  and february   respectively  and are recorded within accrued salaries  benefits and other on our consolidated balance sheets 
customer deposits customer deposits are primarily comprised of unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates  and merchandise credits and deferred revenue related to undelivered merchandise 
we maintain a liability for unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates  and merchandise credits until the earlier of redemption  escheatment or four years as we have concluded that the likelihood of our gift cards and gift certificates being redeemed beyond four years from the date of issuance is remote 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues and the related cost of goods sold including shipping costs at the time the products are delivered to our customers 
revenue is recognized for retail sales excluding home delivered merchandise at the 
table of contents point of sale in the store and for home delivered merchandise and direct to customer sales when the merchandise is delivered to the customers 
discounts provided to customers are accounted for as a reduction of sales 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns in each reporting period 
shipping and handling fees charged to the customer are recognized as revenue at the time the products are delivered to the customer 
revenues are presented net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
sales return reserve our customers may return purchased items for an exchange or refund 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns  net of cost of goods sold  based on historical return trends together with current product sales performance 
as of february  and february   our reserve for sales returns was  and  respectively 
stock based compensation we measure and record compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements for all stock based compensation awards using a fair value method 
for stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights option awards  fair value is determined using the black scholes valuation model  while restricted stock units are valued using the closing price of our stock on the date prior to the date of issuance 
significant factors affecting the fair value of option awards include the estimated future volatility of our stock price and the estimated expected term until the option award is exercised or cancelled 
the fair value of the award is amortized over the requisite service period 
total stock based compensation expense was   and  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and is recorded as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal stock compensation expense was impacted by the reversal of approximately  of expense previously recognized relating to previously issued stock awards that would have vested based on the achievement of certain performance criteria 
we had recognized compensation expense related to these awards as we believed that it was probable that the performance criteria would be achieved 
during the third quarter of fiscal  due to the decline in our operating performance  we concluded that it was no longer probable that these criteria would be achieved and therefore reversed approximately  of compensation expense previously recognized 
subsequently  our board of directors decided to remove or modify the performance conditions but retain the service provisions of the awards 
as a result  these awards are now considered probable of vesting 
accordingly  we measured the fair value of all such awards as of the date of the modification and will recognize the fair value over the remaining service period of the awards 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
we record reserves for estimates of probable settlements of foreign and domestic tax audits 
at any one time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
additionally  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
on january   which clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions 
fin prescribes a process for the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and requires us to make estimates of the likelihood that certain tax positions will be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is reasonably possible that current income tax examinations involving uncertain tax positions could be resolved within the next months through administrative adjudicative procedures or settlement 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements on february   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  for all financial assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
establishes a standard definition for fair value  provides a framework under generally accepted accounting principles for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
b  effective date of fasb no 
 which delayed the effective date of sfas no 
for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities except those recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis to annual reporting periods beginning after november  we do not have significant financial assets and liabilities or nonfinancial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis and  as such  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
further  we do not expect the adoption of fsp no 
b to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
additional disclosures will be provided in our form q for our first fiscal quarter ending may  on february   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the adoption of sfas no

revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r will change the accounting for business combinations 
under sfas r  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
sfas r will change the accounting treatment for certain specific acquisition related items  including expensing acquisition related costs as incurred  valuing non controlling interests minority interests at fair value at the acquisition date  and expensing restructuring costs associated with an acquired business 
sfas r applies prospectively  with limited exceptions  to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first fiscal period beginning on or after december  early adoption is not permitted 
generally  the effect of sfas r will depend on future acquisitions and  as such  we do not currently expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include significant deterioration of the us and foreign markets  changes in us interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  including the devaluation of the us dollar  and the effects of uncertain economic forces which may affect the prices we pay our vendors in the foreign countries in which we do business 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk as of february   we have three debt instruments with variable interest rates which subject us to risks associated with changes in interest rates the interest payable on our credit facility  mississippi industrial development bond and bond related debt associated with our memphis based distribution facilities 
as of february   the total outstanding principal balance on these instruments was  weighted average interest rate of approximately as of february  
although we had no borrowings outstanding under our line of credit facility as of year end  had we borrowed under our line of credit on february   the interest rate in effect would have been approximately 
if interest rates on these existing variable rate debt instruments rose basis points an approximate increase in the associated variable rates as of february   our results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
in addition  we have fixed and variable income investments consisting of short term investments classified as cash and cash equivalents  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of february   our investments  made solely in u 
s treasury bills and money market funds  are stated at cost and approximate their fair values 
an increase in interest rates of would have an immaterial effect on the value of these investments 
declines in interest rates  however  have and would in the future decrease the income derived from these investments 
foreign currency risks we purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the us in transactions that are denominated in us dollars  however  approximately of our international purchase transactions are in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro 
any currency risks related to these international purchase transactions were not significant to us during fiscal and fiscal since we pay for the majority of our international purchases in us dollars  however  a decline in the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies would subject us to risks associated with increased purchasing costs from our vendors in their effort to offset any lost profits associated with any currency devaluation 
we can not predict with certainty the effect these increased costs may have on our financial statements or results of operations 
in addition  as of february   we have retail stores in canada and limited operations in both europe and asia  each of which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
although these exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to us in the past  we may enter into foreign currency contracts in the future to minimize any currency remeasurement risk associated with the intercompany assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries 
we did not enter into any foreign currency contracts during fiscal or fiscal
