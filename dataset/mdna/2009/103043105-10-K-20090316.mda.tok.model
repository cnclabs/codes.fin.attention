also  contributing to the decrease in working capital is the classification of approximately million of auction rate securities  at par  as a noncurrent asset as of december   which is discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these decreases are partially offset by a decrease in accrued employee compensation and benefits  as a result of the decrease in accrued incentive compensation as of december  based on the operating results and the cost savings initiatives implemented by the company  as previously discussed 
october  marked the five year anniversary of the company s million notes  and was also the first day on which the put and call option became exercisable 
on this date  holders of approximately million of the notes exercised their right to have the company repurchase their notes 
as a result  the company repurchased approximately million of the notes in cash  at par  plus accrued interest  using borrowings under its existing revolving credit facility  and approximately million of the notes remain outstanding 
the company believes that the high incidence of notes put back to the company was primarily attributed to the adverse change in the general convertible notes market during september during the third quarter of  as an inducement to holders to not put their notes  the company amended the terms of the note indenture effective october  for the notes which remained outstanding on that date 
the amendment increases the semi annual cash interest payable on the notes from to per annum for interest accruing for the period from october  to october  the amendment also provides the note holders with an additional put option on october  in addition  the amendment changes the conversion price applicable to the notes to per share from per share for the period from october  to october  and includes a make whole table in the event of fundamental changes  including but not limited to  certain consolidations or mergers that result in a change of control of the company during the period from october  until october  these amendments apply to the million of notes which remain outstanding 
the company had million of borrowings outstanding under its million five year senior  unsecured revolving credit facility as of december  the amounts outstanding under this facility are classified as long term debt since the facility is due to expire in may bowne s revolving credit facility contains customary restrictions  requirements and other limitations on its ability to incur indebtedness  including covenants that limit its ability to incur debt based on the level of its ratio of total debt to ebitda and its ratio of ebitda to interest expense 
the company s ability to borrow under this 
table of contents facility is subject to compliance with certain financial and other covenants 
the company was in compliance with all financial loan covenants under the revolving credit facility as of december   and based upon its current projections  including the anticipated benefits of the previously mentioned cost savings initiatives and benefits of the acquisitions  the company believes it will be in compliance with the financial loan covenants in however  further deterioration of the company s operating results coupled with additional borrowings on its remaining capacity under the credit facility may bring the company much closer to its financial covenant compliance levels than in the past 
failure to comply with covenants could cause a default under the facility  and bowne may then be required to repay the debt  or negotiate an amendment 
under those circumstances  other sources of capital may not be available to the company  or be available only on unattractive terms 
the company is not subject to any financial covenants under the notes other than cross default provisions 
as of march   the company had million outstanding under the existing facility  which reflects the normal seasonal increase in borrowing in the first quarter 
as of march   the company has approximately million of letters of credit outstanding 
as such  total available borrowings under the credit facility as of march  are approximately million 
the company is in discussions with the members of its bank group to amend and extend its existing revolving credit facility

some of the actions the company has taken include i the january workforce reduction  expected to result in annualized savings of approximately million in  ii suspension of the matching contribution to the k savings plan for the plan year  elimination of normal merit increases in and a targeted reduction in travel and entertainment spending  expected to result in combined savings of approximately million in  and iii the suspension of the payment of dividends in cash until economic conditions improve 
in february  the company issued stock dividends to its shareholders equivalent to per share  which was based on the average sales price of the company s common stock for the day trading period prior to the dividend record date  and equates to shares of the company s common stock held as of the dividend record date 
in addition  the dividends on any fractional shares were paid in cash 
the company experiences certain seasonal factors with respect to its working capital  the heaviest demand for utilization of working capital is normally the first and second quarter 
the company s existing borrowing capacity provides for this seasonal demand 
although the company believes that the level of cash flow expected from operations and the remaining availability under its credit facility should be adequate to fund its operating needs in the foreseeable future  there are no assurances at this time that this will be the case

the company is in discussions with the members of its bank group to amend and extend its existing revolving credit facility 
such amendment and extension is expected to be completed in the near future 
however  there is no assurance that the full amount of this facility will be amended and extended 
the operating lease obligations shown in the table have not been reduced by minimum non cancelable sublease rentals aggregating approximately million throughout the terms of the leases 
the company remains secondarily liable under these leases in the event that the sub lessee defaults under the sublease terms 
the company does not believe that material payments will be required as a result of the secondary liability provisions of the primary lease agreements 
unconditional purchase obligations represent commitments for outsourced services 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has long term liabilities for deferred employee compensation  including pension  supplemental retirement plan  and deferred compensation 
the payments related to the supplemental retirement plan and deferred compensation are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the company  and whether the employee elects lump sum or annuity payments

critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting polices are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the selection and application of these accounting principles and methods requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as certain financial statement disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to the recognition of revenue  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  income tax provision and deferred taxes  restructuring costs  actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans  and contingent liabilities related to litigation and other claims and assessments 
these estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment  which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors  including the current economic environment 
we adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate 
the weakening economy  illiquid credit markets  and declines in capital markets activity have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
changes in those estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods 
the company has identified its critical accounting policies and estimates below 
these are policies and estimates that the company believes are the most important in portraying the company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
accounting for goodwill and intangible assets two issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment a the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation  and b the ongoing evaluation for impairment 

table of contents in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
business combinations  the company allocates the cost of acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as customer relationships  are amortized to expense over time  while purchase price allocated to in process research and development  if any  is recorded as a charge at the acquisition date if it is determined that it has no alternative future use 
the company s future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of identifiable intangible assets and potential impairment charges related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
accordingly  the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on the company s future operating results 
the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies to intangible assets and goodwill requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate to value these cash flows 
should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
the company has acquired certain identifiable intangible assets in connection with its recent acquisitions 
these identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of the value associated with customer relationships and technology 
the valuation of these identifiable intangible assets is subjective and requires a great deal of expertise and judgment 
the values of the customer relationships were primarily derived using estimates of future cash flows to be generated from the customer relationships 
this approach was used since the inherent value of the customer relationship is its ability to generate current and future income 
the value of the technology was primarily derived using the cost approach  which computes the amount to recreate the existing technology at the same level of functional utility 
while different amounts would have been reported using different methods or using different assumptions  the company believes that the methods selected and the assumptions used are the most appropriate for each asset analyzed 
depreciation of the acquired technology and amortization of all other intangible assets are charged to operating expenses as separate components of expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas  identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the asset s undiscounted expected future cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value amount 
the company measures potential impairment loss by utilizing an undiscounted cash flow valuation technique 
to the extent that the company s undiscounted future cash flows were to decline substantially  an impairment charge could result 
no impairment charge related to the carrying value of its intangible assets was identified in based on an analysis prepared in accordance with sfas 
there are certain assumptions inherent in projecting the recoverability of the company s identifiable intangible assets 
if actual experience differs from the assumptions made  the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position could be materially impacted 
the company also periodically evaluates the appropriateness of the remaining useful lives of long lived assets and the method of depreciation or amortization 
sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires annual impairment testing of goodwill based upon the estimated fair value of the company s reporting unit 
at december   the company s goodwill balance was  the company currently has one reporting unit 
in testing for potential impairment of goodwill  sfas requires the company to allocate goodwill to the reporting unit to which the acquired goodwill relates  estimate the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill relates  and determine the carrying value book value of the reporting unit 
furthermore  if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for a particular reporting unit  then the company is required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business 
only after this process is completed is the amount of goodwill impairment determined 
accordingly  the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
the company estimated its current fair market value based on its market capitalization as of december   plus an implied control premium 
based on its market capitalization of approximately million  an implied control premium of approximately was needed in order for the company s carrying value not to exceed its estimated fair value 
the company determined that this implied control premium as of december  is within an acceptable range and is reasonable based upon 
table of contents current control premiums used in recent industry wide transactions 
based on this analysis  the company has concluded that the fair value of the company s reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount  and therefore  goodwill is not considered impaired as of december  the company continues to monitor its stock price and market capitalization 
if the price of the company s common stock remains depressed  or if the current global economic conditions do not improve  the company will be required to perform impairment testing of its goodwill in advance of its next annual testing date  which could result in future impairment of its goodwill during an interim period 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which requires that i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenue when services are completed or when the printed documents are shipped to customers 
revenue from virtual dataroom services is recognized when the documents are loaded into the dataroom 
revenue for completed but unbilled work is recognized based on the company s historical standard pricing for type of service and is adjusted to actual when billed 
the company accounts for sales and other use taxes on a net basis in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement 
therefore  these taxes are excluded from revenue and cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales credits the company realizes that it will be unable to collect all amounts that it bills to its customers 
therefore  it estimates the amount of billed receivables that it will be unable to collect and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts and sales credits during each accounting period 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables 
the company s estimates are based on  among other things  the aging of its account receivables  its past experience collecting receivables  information about the ability of individual customers to pay  and current economic conditions 
while such estimates have been within the company s expectations and the provisions established  a change in financial condition of specific customers or in overall trends experienced may result in future adjustments of the company s estimates of recoverability of its receivables 
in addition  the current global economic crisis may adversely affect customers ability to obtain credit to fund operations  which in turn would affect their ability to timely make payment on invoices 
as of december   the company had an allowance for doubtful accounts and sales credits of  accounting for income taxes accounting for taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations 
such judgments include  but are not limited to  the likelihood the company would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards  the adequacy of valuation allowances  and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries 
as part of the process of preparing the company s financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the judgments and estimates used are subject to challenge by domestic and foreign taxing authorities 
it is possible that either domestic or foreign taxing authorities could challenge those judgments and estimates and draw conclusions that would cause the company to incur liabilities in excess of those currently recorded 
the company uses an estimate of its annual effective tax rate at each interim period based upon the facts and circumstances available at that time  while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
changes in the geographical mix or estimated amount of annual pre tax income could impact the company s overall effective tax rate 
the company s overall effective tax rate was for the year ended december  as compared to for the years ended december  and the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december  and  the company had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of  and  respectively 
at december  and  management determined that it is more likely than not that  and  respectively  of such assets will be realized  resulting in a valuation allowance of 
table of contents  and  respectively  which are related to certain net operating losses which may not be utilized in future years 
the company evaluates quarterly the realization of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the primary factor used to assess the likelihood of realization is the company s forecast of future taxable income 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented 
accounting for pensions the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan in the united states 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other retirement plans  sfas which was adopted in december these standards require that expenses and liabilities recognized in financial statements be actuarially calculated 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the future performance of plan assets 
according to sfas  the company is required to recognize the funded status of the plans as an asset or liability in the financial statements  measure defined benefit postretirement plan assets and obligations as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and recognize the change in the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in other comprehensive income 
the primary assumptions used in calculating pension expense and liability are related to the discount rate at which the future obligations are discounted to value the liability  expected rate of return on plan assets  and projected salary increases 
these rates are estimated annually as of december the discount rate assumption is tied to a long term high quality bond index and is therefore subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate was at december  and at december  and  respectively 
a discount rate of was used to calculate the pension expense 
each percentage point change in the discount rate would result in a million change in the projected pension benefit obligation and a million change in annual pension expense 
the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the portfolio 
management uses historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with anticipated future market conditions to estimate the rate of return 
for through the company s expected return on plan assets has remained at 
each percentage point change in the assumed long term rate of return would result in a million change in annual pension expense 
the projected salary increase assumption is based upon historical trends and comparisons of the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
as this rate is also a long term expected rate  it is less likely to change on an annual basis 
management has used the rate of for the past several years 
restructuring accrual during fiscal years  and  the company recorded significant restructuring charges 
the company accounts for these charges in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
accounting for costs associated with exiting leased facilities is based on estimates of current facility costs and is offset by estimates of projected sublease income expected to be recovered over the remainder of the lease 
these estimates are based on a variety of factors including the location and condition of the facility  as well as the overall real estate market 
the actual sublease terms could vary from the estimates used to calculate the initial restructuring accrual  resulting in potential adjustments in future periods 
in management s opinion  the company has made reasonable estimates of these restructuring accruals based upon available information 
the company s accrued restructuring is discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements

 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
under sfas  fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data 
in addition  sfas requires that fair value measurements be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas does not require new fair value measurements and was effective for financial assets and financial liabilities within its scope for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years

these transactions may produce receivables or payables that are fixed in terms of the amount of foreign currency that will be received or paid 
a change in exchange rates between the local functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated increases or decreases the expected amount of local functional currency cash flows upon settlement of the transaction  which results in a foreign currency transaction gain or loss that is included in other income expense in the period in which the exchange rate changes
