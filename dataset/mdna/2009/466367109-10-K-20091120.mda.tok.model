overview our primary source of revenue is from retail sales at jack in the box and qdoba company operated restaurants 
we also derive revenue from jack in the box and qdoba franchised restaurants  including royalties based upon a percent of sales  rents  franchise fees and distribution sales of food and packaging commodities 
in addition  we recognize gains from the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees  which are presented as a reduction of operating costs and expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
the quick service restaurant industry is complex and challenging 
challenges currently facing the sector include higher levels of consumer expectations  intense competition with respect to market share  restaurant locations  labor  menu and product development  changes in the economy  including the current recessionary environment  significant promotional and discounting activity in the qsr and casual dining segments of the industry  costs of commodities and trends for healthier eating 
in light of these challenges  we were able to grow earnings in fiscal due in large part to the successful execution of strategic initiatives  such as refranchising  new unit growth and improving our cost structure 
the following summarizes the most significant events occurring in fiscal earnings from continuing operations per diluted share 
earnings per diluted share of in fiscal represented an increase of more than over fiscal restaurant sales 
the recessionary environment negatively impacted discretionary spending and sales throughout the restaurant industry 
sales at jack in the box company operated restaurants open more than one year same store sales decreased in fiscal versus an increase of in system same store sales at qdoba decreased versus an increase of last fiscal year 
restaurant operating margin 
our consolidated restaurant operating margin improved to  despite the deleverage in same store sales 
commodity costs 
pressures from higher commodity costs have impacted our business 
however  as expected  commodity costs moderated in  increasing approximately over last year  as higher costs for bakery  potatoes and beef were partially offset by lower cheese and dairy 
in  food and packaging costs decreased basis points compared with when such costs increased basis points over the prior year 

table of contents new restaurant growth 
unit expansion was strong during the year  with the opening of new jack in the box and qdoba company operated and franchised restaurants 
both brands opened restaurants in new markets during the year  with sales volumes above system averages 
re image program 
we continued to execute our strategic initiative to reinvent the jack in the box brand  which includes comprehensive enhancements to our restaurant facilities 
as of september   approximately of all jack in the box restaurants were fully re imaged and of the jack in the box system featured the exterior elements of the program 
franchising program 
we continued on pace with our strategic initiative to expand franchising through sales of company operated restaurants to franchisees and new restaurant development  despite tight credit markets 
we refranchised jack in the box restaurants  and qdoba and jack in the box franchisees opened restaurants in we also have signed development agreements with franchisees representing commitments to open a total of and new jack in the box and qdoba restaurants  respectively  over the next five years 
discontinued operations 
in september  the board of directors approved plans to sell our quick stuff convenience stores to maximize the potential of the jack in the box and qdoba brands 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we successfully completed the sale of all locations 
financial reporting the results of operations and cash flows for quick stuff are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented

table of contents revenues restaurant sales decreased in and  primarily reflecting the sale of jack in the box company operated restaurants to franchisees 
to a lesser extent  decreases in same store sales at jack in the box restaurants in and qdoba restaurants in both years also contributed to the sales decline 
additionally  in  the loss of approximately  restaurant operating days due to the impact of hurricane ike contributed to the decline in restaurant sales 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the number of qdoba company operated restaurants and  in  modest increases in per store average psa sales at jack in the box company operated restaurants 
same store sales at jack in the box company operated restaurants decreased in compared with a increase in and include the impact of price increases of approximately and  respectively 
distribution sales to jack in the box and qdoba franchisees grew to million in from million in and million in the increase in distribution sales in and primarily relates to an increase in the number of jack in the box and qdoba franchised restaurants serviced by our distribution centers  partially offset by lower per store average volumes in higher food costs in also contributed to the sales increase per comparison with the following table reflects the detail of our franchised restaurant revenues in each year dollars in thousands royalties rents franchise fees and other franchised restaurant revenues change average number of franchised restaurants jack in the box effective royalty rate qdoba effective royalty rate includes re image contributions to franchisees of million  million and million in  and  respectively  which were recorded as a reduction of franchised restaurant revenues 
the increase in franchised restaurant revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of franchised restaurants reflecting the franchising of jack in the box company operated restaurants and new restaurant development by qdoba and jack in the box franchisees 
operating costs and expenses food and packaging costs decreased to of restaurant sales in from in and compared with in the decline in included the benefit of selling price increases  favorable product mix changes and margin improvement initiatives  offset in part by commodity cost increases of approximately 
in  higher commodity costs  primarily cheese  shortening  eggs  and beef were partially offset by selling price increases 
payroll and employee benefit costs improved to of restaurant sales in and from in  due primarily to labor productivity initiatives and lower workers compensation costs which more than offset minimum wage increases 
occupancy and other costs were of restaurant sales in  in and in the percent of sales increase in was due primarily to higher depreciation expense related to the ongoing re image program at jack in the box restaurants and a kitchen enhancement project completed in  higher rent and depreciation related to new restaurant development at qdoba and sales deleverage at jack in the box and qdoba restaurants  which were partially offset by lower utility costs 
the percentage increase in is primarily attributable to higher utility costs and an increase in depreciation expense related to our re image and kitchen enhancement programs 

table of contents distribution costs of sales increased to million in from million in and million in  primarily reflecting increases in the related sales 
these costs were of distribution sales in  in  and in the percentage increase in compared with is due primarily to costs incurred in connection with outsourcing our transportation services and lower volumes 
the percentage increase in primarily relates to higher fuel and delivery costs compared with franchised restaurant costs  principally rents and depreciation on properties leased to jack in the box franchisees  increased million in and million in  due primarily to an increase in the number of franchised restaurants that sublease property from us as a result of our refranchising activities 
the following table sets forth the change in selling  general and administrative sg a expense components between periods in thousands increase decrease vs

advertising declines primarily related to refranchising strategy refranchising strategy overhead reduction severance incentive compensation preopening expenses facility charges including impairment and accelerated depreciation cash surrender value of insurance products used to fund certain nonqualified retirement plans  net insurance losses and legal settlements  net other our contributions to the marketing fund  which are determined as a percentage of restaurant sales  decreased primarily due to our refranchising strategy and contributed to the decline in sg a expenses in both and additionally  in  the partial recovery of prior year losses related to the cash surrender value of our coli policies  net of changes in our non qualified deferred compensation obligation supported by these policies  also contributed to the decrease 
in  these decreases were partially offset by higher preopening costs related to the opening of jack in the box restaurants versus in  and severance costs 
in  the decrease in sg a expenses also relates to lower incentive compensation and the impact of our refranchising strategy on field management and administrative expenses 
these decreases were offset in part by losses on the cash surrender value of our coli policies  net  losses related to hurricanes and an increase in facility charges related to the jack in the box re image program  the kitchen enhancement project and the impairment of seven restaurants we continue to operate 
gains on the sale of company operated restaurants were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the change in gains relates to the number of restaurants sold and the specific sales and cash flows of those restaurants 
in  we sold jack in the box restaurants  compared with in  and in interest expense interest expense was million  million  and million  in  and  respectively 
the decreases in interest expense in and primarily relate to lower average interest rates which were partially offset by higher average borrowings in fiscal also included a million charge in the first quarter to write off deferred financing fees in connection with the replacement of our credit facility 

table of contents interest income interest income was million  million  and million  in  and  respectively 
the increase in from a year ago primarily reflects interest earned on notes receivable 
the decrease in compared with is due to lower average cash balances 
income taxes the income tax provisions reflect effective tax rates of   and of pretax earnings from continuing operations in  and  respectively 
the higher tax rates in and are primarily attributable to market performance of insurance investment products used to fund certain non qualified retirement plans 
changes in the cash value of the insurance products are not deductible or taxable 
earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations were million or per diluted share  in  million or per diluted share  in  and million or per diluted share  in earnings from discontinued operations  net as described in the financial reporting section  quick stuff s results of operations have been reported as discontinued operations 
in  the loss from discontinued operations  net was million  reflecting the million net of tax loss from the sale of quick stuff in the fourth quarter 
earnings from discontinued operations  net were million and million in and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources general 
our primary sources of short term and long term liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations  the revolving bank credit facility  the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees and the sale and leaseback of certain restaurant properties 
our cash requirements consist principally of working capital  capital expenditures for new restaurant construction and restaurant renovations  income tax payments  debt service requirements  and obligations related to our benefit plans 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that cash flows from operations  combined with other financing alternatives in place or available  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure  working capital and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories and our vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new units and refurbishment of existing units  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
as a result  we typically maintain current liabilities in excess of current assets that result in a working capital deficit 
cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at september  from million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
this increase is primarily due to cash flows provided by operating activities  proceeds received from the sale of quick stuff and company operated restaurants  and collections on notes receivable 
these cash inflows were partially offset by cash used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and purchase property and equipment 
we generally reinvest available cash flows from operations to develop new restaurants or enhance existing restaurants  to repurchase shares of our common stock and to reduce debt 

table of contents cash flows 
the table below summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years in thousands 
total cash provided by used in operating activities continuing operations discontinued operations investing activities continuing operations discontinued operations financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
operating cash flows from continuing operations decreased million in due to a decrease in earnings from continuing operations adjusted for non cash items primarily our provision for deferred income taxes  partially offset by fluctuations due to the timing of working capital receipts and disbursements 
in  cash flows from continuing operations decreased million compared with primarily due to the timing of working capital receipts and disbursements  including an increase in pension contributions  partially offset by an increase in earnings from continuing operations adjusted for non cash items 
operating cash flows from our discontinued operations were not material to our consolidated statements of cash flows 
investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations decreased million compared with a year ago 
this decrease is primarily due to an increase in cash proceeds from the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees  lower spending for purchases of property and equipment and an increase in collections on notes receivable  offset in part by an increase in spending related to assets held for sale and leaseback and cash used in to acquire qdoba franchise operated restaurants 
in  cash flows used in investing activities increased million due to higher capital expenditures offset in part by an increase in proceeds from the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees and the impact of cash used in to acquire qdoba restaurants previously operated by franchisees 
in  cash flows provided by discontinued operations increased million compared with a year ago due primarily to proceeds received in of million related to the sale of our quick stuff convenience and fuel stores 
in  the decrease in cash flows used in investing activities relates to a decrease in capital expenditures 
capital expenditures 
the composition of capital expenditures used in continuing operations in each year follows in thousands jack in the box new restaurants restaurant facility improvements other  including corporate qdoba total capital expenditures used in continuing operations our capital expenditure program includes  among other things  investments in new locations  restaurant remodeling  new equipment and information technology enhancements 
in  capital expenditures decreased due to lower spending related to our reimage program as well as the inclusion of a kitchen enhancement project and the purchase of our smoothie equipment in  which also contributed to the increased spending in compared with the kitchen enhancements were designed to increase restaurant capacity for new product introductions while also reducing utility expense using energy efficient equipment 
the reimage program  which 
table of contents began in  is an important part of the chain s holistic brand reinvention initiative and is intended to create a warm and inviting dining experience for jack in the box guests 
in  we focused our reimage efforts on completing the restaurant exteriors as the majority of the company s business is conducted through the drive thru 
with the exteriors substantially completed  we will focus on reimaging restaurant interiors 
as of september   approximately of all company operated restaurants feature all interior and exterior elements of the reimage program and we now expect system wide completion by the end of fiscal year in fiscal  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million  including investment costs related to the jack in the box restaurant re image program 
we plan to open approximately new jack in the box and new qdoba company operated restaurants in sale of company operated restaurants 
we have continued our strategy of selectively selling jack in the box company operated restaurants to franchisees 
in  we generated cash proceeds and notes receivable of million from the sale of restaurants compared with million in from the sale of restaurants and million in from the sale of restaurants 
fiscal years and include million and million  respectively  of financing provided to facilitate the closing of certain transactions 
the million in notes receivable at september  related to franchising transactions was repaid in as of september   notes receivable related to refranchisings were million  of which we anticipate approximately million will be repaid in fiscal we expect total proceeds of million from the sale of jack in the box restaurants in acquisition of franchise operated restaurants 
in the first quarter of  qdoba acquired franchise operated restaurants for approximately million  net of cash received 
the total purchase price was allocated to property and equipment  goodwill and other income 
the restaurants acquired are located in michigan and los angeles  which we believe provide good long term growth potential consistent with our strategic goals 
in the third quarter of  qdoba acquired nine franchise operated restaurants for approximately million in cash 
the primary assets acquired include million in net property and equipment and million in goodwill 
financing activities 
cash used in financing activities increased million primarily attributable to cash used in for the repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in  cash used in financing activities decreased due to a decrease in share repurchases and proceeds from the issuance of common stock  offset in part by a decrease in credit facility borrowings 
financing 
our credit facility is comprised of i a million revolving credit facility maturing on december  and ii a term loan maturing on december   both bearing interest at london interbank offered rate libor plus 
as part of the credit agreement  we may request the issuance of up to million in letters of credit  the outstanding amount of which reduces the net borrowing capacity under the agreement 
the credit facility requires the payment of an annual commitment fee based on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the credit facility s interest rates and the annual commitment rate are based on a financial leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by first priority liens and security interests in the capital stock  partnership and membership interests owned by us and or our subsidiaries  and any proceeds thereof  subject to certain restrictions set forth in the credit agreement 
additionally  the credit agreement includes a negative pledge on all tangible and intangible assets including all real and personal property with customary exceptions 
at september   we had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility  million outstanding under the term loan and letters of credit outstanding of million 
loan origination costs associated with the credit facility were million and are included as deferred costs in other assets  net in the consolidated balance sheet 
deferred financing fees of million related to the prior credit facility were written off in fiscal and are included in interest expense  net in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended september  covenants 
we are subject to a number of customary covenants under our credit facility  including limitations on additional borrowings  acquisitions  loans to franchisees  capital expenditures  lease commitments  stock repurchases and dividend payments  and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios 
following the end of each fiscal year  we may be required to prepay the term debt with a portion of our excess cash flows for such fiscal year  as defined in the credit agreement 
other events and transactions  such as certain asset sales  may also trigger 
table of contents an additional mandatory prepayment 
in connection with the sale of quick stuff in  we estimate we will be required to make a term loan prepayment of million in february  which will be applied to the remaining scheduled principal installments on a pro rata basis 
interest rate swaps 
to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates under our credit facility  we entered into two interest rate swaps that effectively converted million of our variable rate term loan borrowings to a fixed rate basis until april  these agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges with effectiveness assessed on changes in the present value of the term loan interest payments 
there was no hedge ineffectiveness in or accordingly  changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts were recorded  net of taxes  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the company s consolidated balance sheets at the end of each period 
repurchases of common stock 
in november  the board of directors approved a program to repurchase up to million in shares of our common stock over three years expiring november  during fiscal  we repurchased million shares at an aggregate cost of million 
as of september   the aggregate remaining amount authorized and available under our credit agreement for repurchase was million 
in fiscal  pursuant to a tender offer in december  we accepted for purchase approximately million shares of common stock for a total cost of million 
all shares repurchased were subsequently retired 
in fiscal  we also repurchased million shares of stock for million and million shares for million in connection with stock repurchase authorizations made by our board of directors in and  respectively 
share based compensation 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock decreased million in reflecting a decline in the exercise of employee stock options compared with  which also resulted in a corresponding decrease in tax benefits from share based compensation 
as options granted are exercised  the company will continue to receive proceeds and a tax deduction  but the amount and the timing of these cash flows cannot be reliably predicted as option holders decisions to exercise options will be largely driven by movements in the company s stock price 
off balance sheet arrangements 
other than operating leases  we are not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
we finance a portion of our new restaurant development through sale leaseback transactions 
these transactions involve selling restaurants to unrelated parties and leasing the restaurants back 
additional information regarding our operating leases is available in item  properties  and note  leases  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations and commitments 
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  in thousands payments due by year less than total year years years after years contractual obligations credit facility term loan revolving credit facility capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase commitments benefit obligations total contractual obligations other commercial commitments stand by letters of credit 
table of contents obligations related to our credit facility  capital lease obligations  and other long term debt obligations include interest expense estimated at interest rates in effect on september  includes purchase commitments for food  beverage  packaging items and certain utilities 
includes expected payments associated with our defined benefit plans  postretirement benefit plans and our non qualified deferred compensation plan through fiscal consists primarily of letters of credit for workers compensation and general liability insurance 
the contractual obligations and commitments table includes million in contributions we expect to make to our pension plans in fiscal we maintain two pension plans  a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan qualified pension plan covering substantially all full time employees and an unfunded supplemental executive plan non qualified pension plan 
our policy is to fund our qualified pension plan at amounts necessary to satisfy the minimum amount required by law  plus additional amounts as determined by management to improve the plan s funded status 
based on the funding status of our qualified pension plan as of our last measurement date  we are not required to make a minimum contribution in  however  we currently expect to make voluntary contributions of approximately million during the fiscal year 
contributions beyond fiscal will depend on changes in the discount rate and returns on plan assets 
as of september   our qualified pension plan had a projected benefit obligation pbo of million and plan assets of million  and our non qualified pension plan had a pbo of million 
discussion of critical accounting estimates we have identified the following as our most critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective and complex judgments 
information regarding our other significant accounting estimates and policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation we offer share based compensation plans to attract  retain and motivate key officers  non employee directors and employees to work toward the financial success of the company 
share based compensation cost for our stock option grants is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by an option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the option pricing models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
retirement benefits our defined benefit and other postretirement plans costs and liabilities are determined using several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  including assumptions about the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
our discount rate is set annually by us  with assistance from our actuaries  and is determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a population of high quality bonds with a moody s or standard and poor s rating of aa or better meeting certain other criteria 
as of september   our discount rate was for our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans 
our expected long term rate of return on assets is determined taking into consideration our projected asset allocation and economic forecasts prepared with the assistance of our actuarial consultants 
as of september   our assumed expected long term rate of return was for our qualified defined benefit plan 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may affect the amount of pension expense we record 
a hypothetical basis point reduction in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in an estimated increase of million and million  respectively  in our fiscal pension expense 
we expect our pension expense to increase in fiscal principally due to a decrease in our discount rate from to 
self insurance we are self insured for a portion of our losses related to workers compensation  general liability  automotive  medical and dental programs 
in estimating our self insurance accruals  we utilize independent actuarial estimates of expected losses  which are based on statistical analysis of historical data 
these assumptions are closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
should a greater 
table of contents amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected  accruals might not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
long lived assets property  equipment and certain other assets  including amortized intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
this review generally includes a restaurant level analysis  except when we are actively selling a group of restaurants in which case we perform our impairment evaluations at the group level 
impairment evaluations for individual restaurants take into consideration a restaurant s operating cash flows  the period of time since a restaurant has been opened or remodeled  refranchising expectations  and the maturity of the related market 
impairment evaluations for a group of restaurants take into consideration the group s expected future cash flows and sales proceeds from bids received  if any  or fair market value based on  among other considerations  the specific sales and cash flows of those restaurants 
if the assets of a restaurant or group of restaurants subject to our impairment evaluation are not recoverable based upon the forecasted  undiscounted cash flows  we recognize an impairment loss by the amount which the carrying value of the assets exceeds fair value 
our estimates of cash flows used to assess impairment are subject to a high degree of judgment and may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
goodwill and other intangibles we also evaluate goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
if the determined fair values of these assets are less than the related carrying amounts  an impairment loss is recognized 
the methods we use to estimate fair value include future cash flow assumptions  which may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets and determined that no impairment existed as of september  allowances for doubtful accounts our trade receivables consist primarily of amounts due from franchisees for rents on subleased sites  royalties and distribution sales 
we continually monitor amounts due from franchisees and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses 
this estimate is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific franchisee accounts  as well as a general allowance based on historical trends  the financial condition of our franchisees  consideration of the general economy and the aging of such receivables 
we have good relationships with our franchisees and high collection rates  however  if the future financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make specific required payments  we may be required to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
legal accruals the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business 
a determination of the amount accrued  if any  for these contingencies is made after analysis of each matter 
we continually evaluate such accruals and may increase or decrease accrued amounts  as we deem appropriate 
income taxes we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes 
these estimates include  among other items  depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  allowable tax credits  effective rates for state and local income taxes and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
we adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available 
our estimates are based on the best available information at the time that we prepare the income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
future application of accounting principles in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on fair value measurements 
this guidance clarifies the definition of fair value  describes methods used to appropriately measure fair value  and expands fair value disclosure requirements 
this guidance applies under other accounting pronouncements that currently require or permit fair value measurements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those years 
we adopted the provisions of the fair value measurement guidance for our financial assets and liabilities and have elected to defer adoption for our nonfinancial assets and liabilities until fiscal year 
table of contents we are currently in the process of assessing the impact this guidance may have on our consolidated financial statements related to our nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for consolidation  which changes the approach for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in variable interest entity and requires more frequent reassessments of whether an enterprise is a primary beneficiary 
this guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after november  we are currently in the process of assessing the impact this guidance may have on our consolidated financial statements 
other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to risks relating to financial instruments is changes in interest rates 
our credit facility  which is comprised of a revolving credit facility and a term loan  bears interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate or libor plus an applicable margin based on a financial leverage ratio 
as of september   the applicable margin for the libor based revolving loans and term loan was set at we use interest rate swap agreements to reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
at september   we had two interest rate swap agreements having an aggregate notional amount of million expiring april  these agreements effectively convert a portion of our variable rate bank debt to fixed rate debt and have an average pay rate of  yielding a fixed rate of including the term loan s applicable margin of 
a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates  based on the outstanding unhedged balance of our revolving credit facility and term loan at september  would result in an estimated increase of million in annual interest expense 
we are also exposed to the impact of commodity and utility price fluctuations related to unpredictable factors such as weather and various other market conditions outside our control 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher prices is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
from time to time  we enter into futures and option contracts to manage these fluctuations 
at september   we had natural gas over the counter call option agreements in place that represent approximately of our total requirements for natural gas for the months of november through march
