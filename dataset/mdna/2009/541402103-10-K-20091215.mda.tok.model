liquidity and capital resources despite having a net loss of  our operations produced net cash of  during fiscal  we wrote off  of inventories and  of property and equipment no longer in use  all of which increased our net loss but did not affect cash flows from operations 
the collection of accounts receivable produced  and the reduction of prepaid expenses produced  of net cash  respectively 
during fiscal  we also liquidated all  of our auction rate securities ars  paid down the bank borrowings of  based on those ars  and made capital expenditures of  our operations used net cash of  despite a large net loss of  for fiscal inventory write downs totaling  and a write off of property and equipment no longer in use totaling  increased our net loss but did not affect cash flows 
sales of existing inventories produced  of cash for operations  while timing of invoices resulted in an increase in accounts payable of  prior to the collapse of the auction rate securities market  we liquidated  of our investment 
capital expenditures of  included mask tooling and production tooling for new products 
despite having a net loss of  for fiscal  our operations produced net cash of  during fiscal  we wrote off  of inventories   of capitalized test software  and  of property and equipment no longer in use  all of which increased the net loss but did not affect cash flows from operations 
during the year  we also increased our inventory valuation allowance by  while writing off  of inventories against this valuation allowance 
we also continue to purchase additional available for sale securities as a means to increase the return on our cash and cash equivalents balances  with purchases of  in fiscal capital expenditures of  included leasehold improvements for our new facilities into which we moved on september  working capital our investment in inventories has been significant and will continue to be significant in the future 
however  during the past few years  we have been able to reduce our levels of inventories as we shift from more competitive second source products to proprietary sole source products 
we seek to further streamline our inventories as we continue to shift to sole source proprietary products 
we rely on third party suppliers for our raw materials  particularly our processed wafers  for which we currently rely primarily on two suppliers  and as a result  maintain substantial inventory levels to protect against disruption in supplies 
we have periodically experienced disruptions in obtaining wafers 
as we continue to shift towards higher margin proprietary products  we expect to be able to reduce inventory levels by streamlining our product offerings 
periodically  we review inventory to determine recoverability of items on hand using the lower of cost or market locom and excess methods 
we group and evaluate our products based on their underlying die or wafer type our raw materials  silicon wafers  can generally be used to make multiple products  to determine the total quantity on hand and average unit costs 
management uses judgment in comparing historical sales quantities to the quantity on hand at the end of the fiscal year 
if the quantity on hand exceeds the sales quantities  we provide a valuation allowance for the potentially obsolete or slow moving items 
for the locom analysis  we compare the average historical sales price to the average unit cost of inventories at the end of the fiscal year 
if the average unit cost exceeds the average sales price  we provide a valuation allowance 
with continuing low revenue levels  management felt it necessary to also review our raw materials and work in process 
our products generally exhibit an active sales product life cycle of ten or more years 
however  due to rapid changes in process technology  we are generally unable to obtain wafers for our products for as long a period as their life cycles 
as a result  early in a product s life  we are often required to estimate the sales expectations for the entire life cycle and purchase materials upfront 
on some occasions  our expectations become lower and we provide a reserve for potential excess materials 
in fiscal  we wrote down inventory of  in fiscal  we wrote down inventory against our inventory valuation allowance of  and additional inventory totaling  in fiscal  we increased our inventory valuation allowance by  for potential excess materials  while writing down  of inventory against this previously established allowance 
in addition  during fiscal  we scrapped other inventory of  we believe our current inventory valuation provides a reasonable estimate of the recoverability of inventories at the end of fiscal although current levels of inventory impact our liquidity  we believe that this is a less costly alternative to owning a wafer fabrication facility or continuously redesigning our products to newer process technologies  which would divert limited engineering resources from new product development 
we continue to evaluate alternative suppliers to diversify our risk of supply disruption 
however  this requires a significant investment in product development to tool masks with new suppliers 
such efforts compete for our limited product development resources 
we seek to achieve on going reductions in inventory  although there can be no assurance we will be successful 
in the event economic conditions remain slow  we may consider identifying additional portions of inventory to write off at a future date 
historically  due to customer order scheduling  up to of our quarterly revenues were often shipped in the last month of the quarter  so a large portion of the shipments included in year end accounts receivable were not yet due per our net day terms 
this results in year end accounts receivable balances being at their highest point for the respective period 
financing since may  we have had approximately million of auction rate securities ars classified as a short term investment in available for sale securities  which paid a monthly average of  of dividends and interest 
historically  these securities were considered cash alternatives that were risk averse and highly liquid 
beginning in february  the auctions began to fail and no secondary market developed 
accordingly  ars lacked liquidity and were no longer considered cash alternatives 
while there was no current market for the ars  the underlying issuers were required to pay the interest and dividends when due 
on october   we elected to accept an offer from ubs financial services inc ubs to sell our ars to ubs at par value at any time during a two year period  beginning january  in addition  on november   we obtained a no net cost line of credit from ubs bank usa for the par value of our ars 
we drew down the entire  available balance on november  this loan was considered no net cost as the interest charged was the lesser of the libor rate plus an established percentage rate or the interest and or dividends earned on our ars 
therefore  our interest paid could be no more than the interest and or dividends we earned on the ars 
in december  ubs liquidated  of our  of ars  which we used to pay down the line of credit 
in january  the remaining  of ars were liquidated and paid down against the line of credit 
all ubs accounts were closed in february we believe the cost reductions we have undertaken in the past few years will allow us to use this cash  along with cash from future revenues  to fund current operations and future capital needs 
however  we continue to evaluate our debt and equity financing opportunities 
contractual obligations our only contractual obligation is our facility operating lease 
the following table summarizes the future fixed payments under this lease as of september  payment timing may be subject to change 
payments due by period total within year years after years building off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended september  and net revenues for fiscal decreased percent from  in fiscal to  this decrease was the result of fewer military purchases during fiscal compared to fiscal  while the digital cinema project actually increased during fiscal cost of revenues for fiscal decreased percent from  in fiscal to  mainly the result of fiscal including a write down of  in inventories compared to  in fiscal sales of products previously written down to zero were percent of revenues in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal research and development expenses decreased percent from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  mainly the result of reduced work weeks for certain employees  salary cuts made in january  and staffing cuts made at the end of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased six percent from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of reduced work weeks and other cost cuts made during fiscal interest income decreased percent from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  mainly the result of less cash being held with lower interest rates in fiscal other expense consists o  of property and equipment no longer in use and  of interest expense 
as a result of fewer inventory write downs and increased cost cutting during fiscal  our net loss decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal comparison of fiscal years ended september  and net revenues for fiscal decreased percent from  in fiscal to  this decrease was the result of the older products  including the digital cinema project  dropping off with no new product revenues replacing them during fiscal cost of revenues for fiscal increased percent from  in fiscal to  mainly the result of write downs of inventory totaling  sales of products previously written down to zero were of revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal research and development expenses decreased percent from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of the one time  write off of capitalized test software done in fiscal during the last quarter of fiscal  we made a few minor staffing cuts but believe the current team can complete the new products we currently have in development 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased four percent from  in fiscal to  this decrease was mainly the result of general cost cutting in fiscal and the expensing of certain prepaids in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal interest income decreased percent from  in fiscal to  primarily as a result of a smaller balance in available for sale securities and a lower cash balance in fiscal other expense in fiscal consisted of the write off of property and equipment no longer in use 
as a result of the decreased revenues and large write down of inventory  we had a net loss of  in fiscal  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of operations are based upon the financial statements included in this report and the data used to prepare them 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and we are required to make judgments  estimates  and assumptions in the course of such preparation 
the summary of accounting policies included with the financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we reevaluate our judgments  estimates  and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  and valuation of long lived assets 
we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions  and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are the critical accounting policies we believe are affected by significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of product 
sales to distributors are made pursuant to agreements that provide the distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise 
revenues from such sales are recognized upon shipment  with a provision for estimated returns and allowances recorded at that time  if applicable 
while distributors are allowed to return items for stock rotation  they are required to place an order of equal or greater value at the same time 
as the company historically does not have material returns  there is no allowance for returns recorded 
because the company does not change its pricing of products more than once a year  there have not been any pricing issues in the past several years  therefore  there is no allowance for price protection recorded 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish a general allowance for doubtful accounts based on analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness  and current economic conditions 
historically  we have not experienced significant losses related to receivables 
inventories we write down our inventories for lower of cost or market reserves  aged inventory reserves  and obsolescence reserves 
as a result of production requirements and constraints  we are often required to estimate the sales expectations for the entire life cycle of a product which can be ten or more years and purchase materials upfront 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required in the future 
conversely  if demand increases for product types that have been fully reserved  future margins may be higher 
long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill  and other intangible assets  are assessed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable  or whenever management has committed to a plan to dispose of the assets 
such assets are carried at the lower of book value or fair value as estimated by management based on appraisals  current market value  and comparable sales value  as appropriate 
assets to be held and used affected by such impairment loss are depreciated or amortized at their new carrying amounts over the remaining estimated life  assets to be sold or otherwise disposed of are not subject to further depreciation or amortization 
in determining whether an impairment exists  we use undiscounted future cash flows without interest charges compared to the carrying value of the assets 
deferred income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
future tax benefits are subject to a valuation allowance when we are unable to conclude that our deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realized from the results of operations 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred income tax assets that may not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based on the historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets become deductible  management believes it more likely than not that we will not realize benefits of these deductible differences as of september  accordingly  we have established a valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets as of september  impact of new financial accounting standards in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures that defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that allows for the delay of the effective date for fair value measurements for one year for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
in april  the fasb issued additional authoritative guidance in determining whether a market is active or inactive  and whether a transaction is distressed  is applicable to all assets and liabilities ie financial and non financial and will require enhanced disclosures 
this standard was effective beginning with the company s fourth quarter of fiscal the measurement and disclosure requirements related to financial assets and financial liabilities were effective for the company beginning on october  the effective date for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities is the beginning of the company s first quarter of fiscal in february  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
this standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
on october  the company adopted this standard and has elected not to measure any additional financial instruments or other items at fair value 
on april   the company adopted new authoritative guidance related to the recording and disclosure of fair value measurement  which had no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for investments debt and equity securities regarding the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  which amends the other than temporary impairment guidance for debt and equity securities 
on april  the company adopted this standard  which had no impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding subsequent events  which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available to be issued 
the company evaluated subsequent events through december   the date of financial statement issuance 
in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification 
the codification is the single source for all authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied for financial statements issued for periods ending after september  this statement does not change gaap and will not have an affect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company adopted the codification standard on september  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company conducts all of its transactions  including those with foreign suppliers and customers  in us dollars 
it is therefore not directly subject to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations and does not hedge or otherwise deal in currency instruments in an attempt to minimize such risks 
demand from foreign customers and the ability or willingness of foreign suppliers to perform their obligations to the company may be affected by the relative change in value of such customer or supplier s domestic currency to the value of the us dollar 
furthermore  changes in the relative value of the us dollar may change the price of the company s prices relative to the prices of its foreign competitors
