we strive to improve the operating results of new and existing inpatient behavioral health care operations by providing the highest quality service  expanding referral networks and marketing initiatives and meeting increased demand for behavioral health care services by expanding our services and developing new services 
we also attempt to improve operating results by maintaining appropriate staffing ratios  controlling contract labor costs and reducing supply costs through group purchasing 
our same facility revenue from owned and leased inpatient facilities increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  same facility growth in was primarily the result of increases in patient days and revenue per patient day of and  respectively 
same facility growth refers to the comparison of each inpatient facility owned during with the comparable period in  adjusted for closures and combinations for comparability purposes 
income from continuing operations before income taxes increased to million  or of revenue  in as compared to million  or of revenue  in operating results for include an million loss on the refinancing of long term debt 
excluding this refinancing loss  income from continuing operations for was million  or of revenue 
the million increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes and the refinancing loss in compared to was primarily the result of the following operating results from the may  acquisition of horizon health and the march  acquisition of five behavioral health care facilities from umc  same facility growth at our behavioral health care facilities in patient days of and revenue per patient day of  and a reduction in interest expense as a percentage of revenue to in compared to in due primarily to a decrease in our overall effective interest rate 
our operating results for as compared to were negatively impacted by the following items one of our behavioral health care hospitals in chicago experienced a decline in operating results in as compared to primarily due to a hold on admissions placed on this facility by the illinois department of children and family services and costs of professional services related to the united states department of justice investigation 
our self insured reserves for general and professional liability risks increased approximately million at december  compared to december   primarily as a result of the revised assessment of certain claims at amounts higher than originally anticipated and the actuarial implications of such revisions  and an increase in share based compensation expense of million 
sources of revenue patient service revenue patient service revenue is generated by our inpatient facilities for services provided to patients on an inpatient and outpatient basis within the inpatient behavioral health care facility setting 
patient service revenue is recorded at our established billing rates less contractual adjustments 
contractual adjustments are recorded to state our patient service revenue at the amount we expect to collect for the services provided based on amounts reimbursable by medicare or medicaid under provisions of cost or prospective reimbursement formulas or amounts due from other third party payors at contractually determined rates 
patient service revenue comprised approximately of our total revenue in other revenue other behavioral health care services accounted for of our revenue for the year ended december  this portion of our business primarily consists of our contract management and eap businesses 
our contract management business involves the development  organization and management of behavioral health care programs within medical surgical hospitals 
our eap business contracts with employers to assist employees and their dependents with resolution of behavioral conditions or other personal concerns 
services provided are recorded as revenue at contractually determined rates in the period the services are rendered  provided that collectability of such amounts is reasonably assured

accordingly  these operations are included in discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  was million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  at december  this change in working capital is primarily attributable to increases in accounts receivable of million  cost report receivables of million  income tax receivable payable of million and deferred tax assets of million  offset by increases in current maturities under our revolving credit facility of million and other accrued liabilities of million to purchase a hospital building previously leased 
the increase in accounts receivable is primarily the result of increases in same facility revenue and receivables generated from businesses acquired in our consolidated day s sales outstanding were and at december  and  respectively 
in february  our revolving credit facility was amended to extend the maturity of million capacity to december  with the remaining million capacity to mature on december   as originally scheduled  revise the interest rate on borrowings to libor plus a spread ranging from to or prime plus a spread ranging from to  depending upon a leverage ratio  and revise the commitment fee on the unused portion of our revolving credit facility to fluctuate between and  based upon a leverage ratio 
as a result of the extension of our revolving credit facility  million of the million balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december  has been classified as a non current liability with the remainder classified in current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  on february   we used excess cash to reduce the outstanding debt balance on the revolving credit facility to million and now have approximately million available under our revolving credit facility 
cash provided by continuing operating activities was million in compared to million in the increase in cash flows from continuing operating activities was primarily attributable to improved same facility operating margins  the operating results of facilities acquired from horizon health and umc and changes in working capital excluding accrued interest  offset by increased payments for income tax and interest 
billings for patient accounts receivable are generally submitted to the payor within three days of the patient s discharge or completion of services 
interim billings may be utilized for patients with extended lengths of stay 
we verify within a reasonable period of time that claims submitted to third party payors have been received and are being processed by such payors 
follow up regarding the status of each claim is made on a periodic basis until payment on the claim is received 
billing notices for self pay accounts receivable are distributed on a periodic basis 
self pay accounts receivable are turned over to collection agencies once internal collection efforts have been exhausted 
accounts receivable under our inpatient management contracts are billed at least 
table of contents monthly 
follow up collection efforts are made on a periodic basis until payment is received 
our allowance for doubtful accounts for patient receivables primarily consists of patient accounts that are greater than days past the patient s discharge date 
our allowance for doubtful accounts for receivables due under our inpatient management contracts primarily consists of amounts that are specifically identified as potential collection issues 
accounts receivable are written off when collection within a reasonable period of time is deemed unlikely 
cash used by continuing investing activities was million in compared to million in cash used in investing activities in was primarily the result of million paid for acquisitions of behavioral health care facilities and million paid for purchases of fixed assets 
acquisitions in consisted primarily of five inpatient behavioral health care facilities acquired from umc and eap acquisitions 
cash used for routine and expansion capital expenditures was approximately million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  we expect expansion expenditures to continue during as a result of planned capital expansion projects and the construction of new facilities  which are expected to add approximately new beds to our inpatient facilities 
we define expansion capital expenditures as those that increase the capacity of our facilities or otherwise enhance revenue 
routine or maintenance capital expenditures were of our net revenue for capital expenditures for also include million paid in connection with the purchase of a previously leased hospital 
remaining payments of million related to this purchase are due in cash used in investing activities in was primarily the result of million paid for acquisitions of behavioral health care facilities  including horizon health  and million paid for purchases of fixed assets 
cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in cash provided by financing activities for consisted primarily of million in net borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which were used to finance the acquisition of five inpatient behavioral health care facilities from umc  acquisitions of eap businesses  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
cash provided by financing activities for also included million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and million in income tax benefits in excess of share based compensation expense on stock options exercised in cash provided by financing activities for consisted primarily of additional borrowings of million  which were used primarily to finance the acquisition of horizon health and to retire approximately million of other long term debt 
additionally  during we received million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and million in income tax benefits in excess of share based compensation expense on stock options exercised in we have a universal shelf registration statement on form s under which we may sell an indeterminate amount of our common stock  common stock warrants  preferred stock and debt securities 
we may from time to time offer these securities in one or more series  in amounts  at prices and on terms satisfactory to us 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with merrill lynch capital services  inc to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
with this interest rate swap agreement we exchange the interest payments associated with a notional amount of million of libor indexed variable rate debt related to our senior secured term loan facility for a fixed interest rate 
this interest rate swap agreement matures on november  the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at december  reflected a liability of million  which represents the estimated amount we would have paid if the agreement was canceled 
we are actively seeking acquisitions that fit our corporate growth strategy and may acquire additional inpatient psychiatric facilities and other operations and will incur continued expenditures on expansion projects 
management continually assesses our capital needs and  should the need arise  we will seek additional financing  including debt or equity  to fund potential acquisitions  facility expansions  payment of indebtedness or for other corporate purposes 
in negotiating such financing  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on terms satisfactory to us 
failure to obtain additional financing on reasonable terms could have a negative effect on our plans to acquire additional inpatient psychiatric facilities 

table of contents obligations and commitments payments due by period in thousands less than more than total year years years years long term debt senior credit facility revolving line of credit facility  expiring on december  extended to december  for  in february and bearing interest of at december  senior secured term loan facility  expiring on july  and bearing interest of at december  senior subordinated notes due july  mortgage loans on facilities  maturing in  and bearing fixed interest rates of to lease and other obligations total contractual obligations excludes capital lease obligations and other obligations of million  which are included in lease and other obligations 
the fair value of our million in principal amount of notes was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the fair values of our revolving credit facility and senior secured term loan facility were approximately million and million  respectively  as of december  the carrying value of our revolving credit facility and senior secured term loan facility approximated fair value at december  the carrying value of our other long term debt  including current maturities  of million and million at december  and december   respectively  approximated fair value 
we had million and million  respectively  of variable rate debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility and senior secured term loan facility as of december  as a result of our interest rate swap agreement to exchange interest rate payments associated with a notional amount of million of libor indexed variable rate debt for a fixed rate  the variable rate debt outstanding under our senior secured term loan facility was effectively million as of december  at our december  borrowing level  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would decrease our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
impact of inflation and economic trends although inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations  the health care industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are supply costs  which tend to escalate as vendors pass on the rising costs through price increases 
some of the freestanding owned  leased and managed inpatient behavioral health care facilities we operate are experiencing the effects of the tight labor market  including a shortage of nurses  which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in our swb expense in excess of the inflation rate 
although we cannot predict our ability to cover future cost increases  management believes that through adherence to cost containment policies  labor management and reasonable price increases  the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable 
our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing health care to medicare and medicaid patients is limited due to various federal  state and local laws which have been enacted that  in certain cases  limit our ability to increase prices 
in addition  as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures and a continuing industry wide shift of patients into managed care plans  our ability to maintain margins through price increases to non medicare patients is limited 
the behavioral health care industry is typically not directly impacted by periods of recession  erosions of consumer confidence or other general economic trends as most health care services are not considered a component of discretionary spending 
however  our inpatient facilities may be indirectly negatively impacted to the extent such economic conditions result in decreased reimbursements by federal or state governments or managed care payors 
discussion concerning the current economic downturn is included in part i  item a under the caption risk factors 
we are not aware of any economic trends that would prevent us from being able to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants and to meet all required obligations and commitments in the near future 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses included in the financial statements 
estimates are based on historical experience and other information currently available  the results of which form the basis of such estimates 
while we believe our estimation processes are reasonable  actual results could differ from our estimates 
the following represent the estimates considered most critical to our operating performance and involve the most subjective and complex assumptions and assessments 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts our ability to collect outstanding patient receivables from third party payors is critical to our operating performance and cash flows 
the primary collection risk with regard to patient receivables lies with uninsured patient accounts or patient accounts for which primary insurance has paid  but the portion owed by the patient remains outstanding 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based upon the age of the accounts since the patient discharge date 
we continually monitor our accounts receivable balances and utilize cash collection data to support our estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts 
significant changes in payor mix or business office operations could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
the primary collection risk with regard to receivables due under our inpatient management contracts is attributable to contractual disputes 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts for these receivables based primarily upon the specific identification of potential collection issues 
as with our patient receivables  we continually monitor our accounts receivable balances and utilize cash collection data to support our estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts 
allowances for contractual discounts the medicare and medicaid regulations are complex and various managed care contracts may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided in our inpatient facilities and cost settlement provisions requiring complex calculations and assumptions subject to interpretation 
we estimate the allowance for contractual discounts on a payor specific basis by comparing our established billing rates with the amount we determine to be reimbursable given our interpretation of the applicable regulations or contract terms 
most payments are determined based on negotiated per diem rates 
while the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates  these differences are deemed immaterial 
additionally  updated regulations and contract renegotiations occur frequently necessitating continual review and assessment of the estimation process by our management 
we periodically compare the contractual rates on our patient accounting systems with the medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates or the third party payor contract for accuracy 
we also monitor the adequacy of our contractual adjustments using financial measures such as comparing cash receipts to net patient revenue adjusted for bad debt expense 
as of december   our patient accounts receivable balance for third party payors was million 
a theoretical change in the amounts due from third party payors at december  could have an after tax effect of approximately million on our financial position and results of operations 
the following table presents the percentage by payor of our net revenue for the years ended december  and and related accounts receivable at year end in thousands for the year ended december  net accounts net accounts revenue receivable revenue receivable medicaid commercial hmo private pay medicare state agency other the following table presents the percentage by aging category of our accounts receivable at december  and in thousands 
table of contents at december  days days days days days days days total our consolidated day s sales outstanding were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our consolidated collections as a percentage of net revenue less bad debt expense was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
professional and general liability we are subject to medical malpractice and other lawsuits due to the nature of the services we provide 
our operations have professional and general liability insurance in umbrella form for claims in excess of million with an insured excess limit of million 
effective december   we increased this insured excess limit to million 
the self insured reserves for professional and general liability risks are estimated based on historical claims  demographic factors  industry trends  severity factors  and other actuarial assumptions calculated by an independent third party actuary 
this self insurance reserve is discounted to its present value using a discount rate 
this estimated accrual for professional and general liabilities could be significantly affected should current and future occurrences differ from historical claim trends and expectations 
we have utilized our captive insurance company to manage the self insured retention 
while claims are monitored closely when estimating professional and general liability accruals  the complexity of the claims and wide range of potential outcomes often limits timely adjustments to the assumptions used in these estimates 
income taxes as part of our process for preparing our consolidated financial statements  our management is required to compute income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the current tax benefit or expense of future deductible and taxable temporary differences 
the tax effects of future deductible and taxable temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities which are components of our balance sheet 
management then assesses our ability to realize the deferred tax assets based on reversals of deferred tax liabilities and  if necessary  estimates of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established when we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management must also assess the impact of our acquisitions on the realization of deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance to determine if all or a portion of the valuation allowance will be offset by reversing taxable differences or future taxable income of the acquired entity 
to the extent the valuation allowance can be reversed due to the estimated future taxable income of an acquired entity  then our valuation allowance is reduced accordingly as an adjustment to purchase price 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on january  applying the provisions of fin requires significant judgments regarding the recognition and measurement of each tax position 
changes in these judgments may materially affect the estimate of our effective tax rate and our operating results 
share based compensation we adopted sfas no 
r under the modified prospective transition method on january   which requires us to measure and recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of such awards 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of our stock options 
the black scholes model includes certain variables and assumptions that require judgment  such as the expected volatility of our stock price and the expected term of our stock options 
additionally  sfas r requires us to use judgment in the estimation of forfeitures over the vesting period of share based awards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
with respect to our interest bearing liabilities and including our interest rate swap  approximately million of our long term debt outstanding at december  was subject to a weighted average fixed interest rate of 
our variable rate debt is comprised of our senior secured term loan facility  which had million outstanding at december  excluding million associated with our interest rate swap and on which interest is generally payable at libor plus  and our million revolving credit facility  which had a million 
table of contents balance outstanding at december  and on which interest is generally payable at libor plus to depending on a certain leverage ratio 
additionally  we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with merrill lynch capital services  inc to exchange the interest payments associated with a notional amount of million of libor indexed variable rate debt for a fixed rate 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would decrease our net income and cash flows by approximately million on an annual basis based upon our borrowing level at december  in the event we draw on our revolving credit facility and interest rates change significantly  we expect management would take actions intended to further mitigate our exposure to such change 
information on quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk and the february amendment of our revolving credit facility is included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources
