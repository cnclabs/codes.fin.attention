they reflect our expectations  beliefs  projections and assumptions  are made in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them  however  there can be no assurance that our financial condition or results of operations will meet the expectations set forth in the forward looking statements set forth below 
forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that in many cases are beyond our control and cannot be predicted or quantified 
as a result  future events and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in  contemplated by  or underlying forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to economic conditions in general  sensitivity to industry conditions  competitive factors such as technology and pricing pressures  business conditions in our particular markets  currency exchange rates  the risk that current economic conditions will negatively impact our ability to satisfy the covenants of our lending agreements  international sales operations  our level of dependence on major customers  increased material costs  risks and costs associated with integrating our acquired businesses  litigation and the risks and that the risks and costs of doing business will exceed our present estimates 
a discussion of these and other specific risks is included in item a under the heading risk factors 
forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k speak only as of the date of this report or in the case of any document incorporated by reference  the date of that document 
except for our ongoing obligation to disclose material information as required by federal securities laws  we are not obligated to update or revise any forward looking statement contained or incorporated by reference in this document to reflect events  circumstances or changed assumptions or operating results occurring after the date of this report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the risk factors as well as our financial statements and the related notes 
introduction we are a worldwide organization and leading designer and manufacturer of hundreds of high quality brand name ac dc and dc dc power supplies  converters  inverters and power management products 
we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers  distributors and service providers who value quality  reliability  technology and service 
we have hundreds of customers in the communications  networking equipment  server storage  computer  instrumentation  industrial  renewable energy  and other electronic equipment industries 
our ac dc power supplies are typically embedded in our customers products and convert alternating current to direct current 
our board mounted dc dc products provide precise levels of dc power to sensitive electronic components embedded in our customers equipment 
our power management products also provide precise levels of dc power to sensitive electronic components  but include elements of communications and control 
in addition  our power management products are programmable via a graphical user interface and offer our customers significant cost and time savings over traditional dc dc converters 
our dc power systems  which provide back up power  are sold primarily to telecommunications and internet service providers worldwide 
our inverters for renewable energy provide conversion from either wind generators or photovoltaic energy into useable ac power for the grid 
in october  we completed the acquisition of the power electronics group subsidiary of magnetek  inc  the acquisition or acquired business for approximately million plus the assumption of approximately million in debt 
we financed this acquisition with a million term loan and million of cash and investments 
the acquired business is primarily engaged in the design  manufacture and sale of custom ac dc products to original equipment manufacturers oems 
table of contents and provides us with enhanced capability in the custom ac dc power supply market  a talented workforce of design engineers located in europe  and an established low cost manufacturing facility in china  all of which we expect will continue to enable us to reduce our overall component and manufacturing costs and broaden our product line and product capabilities 
due to the mix of custom products produced by the acquired business for higher volume applications  they tend to generate lower gross margins than we have traditionally experienced 
the acquired business also designs renewable energy inverters which have higher margins than custom products 
we are in the process of implementing detailed plans to improve our operational and financial performance  drive long term growth and profitability  improve on time delivery  reduce manufacturing inefficiencies  and increase gross margin 
the operating framework in which we manage our business and guide our strategies is based on the disciplined management of three business levers targeted growth  operational efficiency and capital strategy 
although we have made progress towards our goals in recent periods  there are still many areas in which we believe that we can improve 
based on these plans we have already launched the following initiatives we entered into a restructuring plan  during  to reduce our fixed spending by approximately million annually by downsizing operations in north america and relocating certain functions to other existing facilities in low cost locations  and reducing operations and overhead in other foreign locations 
we are significantly increasing our presence in asia to take advantage of a lower cost structure and closer proximity to suppliers and certain major customers 
we are addressing supply chain issues  including programs to lower material costs  the acceleration of the transfer of manufacturing to china  and the implementation of new sales and operations planning processes 
we have two main product lines  referred to as embedded products and power systems 
embedded products include ac dc power supplies  dc dc converters including brick converters and pol converters  and smart motor control products 
power systems products include dc power systems and renewable energy products 
critical accounting policies application of our accounting policies requires management to make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments  although differing amounts may be reported if there are changes in the assumptions and estimates 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  restructuring costs  goodwill impairment  impairment costs  depreciation and amortization  sales returns and discounts  warranty costs  uncertain tax positions and the recoverability of deferred tax assets  stock compensation  business combinations and contingencies 
management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to an understanding of our financial statements and as areas most dependent on management s judgment and estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title transfer has occurred  the price is fixed or readily determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
sales are recorded net of sales returns and discounts  which are estimated at the time of shipment based upon historical data 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment or at the time of inventory consumption for customers on vendor managed inventory vmi programs because this is the point at which revenue is earned and realizable and the earnings process is complete 
for most shipments  title to 
table of contents shipped goods transfers at the shipping point  so the risks and rewards of ownership transfer once the product leaves our warehouse 
for shipments in which title transfers at a later date  revenue recognition is delayed 
revenue is only recognized when collectibility is reasonably assured 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold 
we may charge shipping and handling costs to customers  which are included in revenue 
we offer our distributors a standard agreement which includes payment terms  description of rights to return or exchange product  and price discounts 
under our standard agreement  payment is due within days of shipment of the product to the distributors 
the distributor has a right to return only if we discontinue a product that the distributor has on hand 
the distributor has a right to exchange up to of the dollar value of products purchased within the prior six month period  so long as the distributor is currently purchasing at least the equivalent dollar value in new product 
estimated product exchanges or returns are accrued for at the time of the sale based on historical information in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
finally  we may give price discounts to a distributor at the time a purchase order is received from the distributor for product that they will sell to a specific customer 
the price discount is available for one year following issuance of the purchase order for items listed on the purchase order 
we accrue for the estimated price discount at the time revenue is recognized 
we have a joint venture in asia which  along with certain of our contract manufacturers  may purchase raw components and other goods from power one  and sell finished goods back to power one as well as to other third parties 
we record revenue on sales to the joint venture and contract manufacturers only when the components and goods are for sales to third parties 
when the joint venture or contract manufacturers purchase components that will be assembled and sold back to us  no revenue is recorded because the earnings process has not been completed 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we review the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets using the methodology prescribed in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
management evaluates the company as a single reporting unit for business and operating purposes as many of the company s revenue streams are generated by technology related to more than a single long lived asset  and individual long lived assets support more than one of our revenue categories 
in addition  the majority of our costs are  by their nature  shared costs that are not specifically identifiable with a particular long lived asset or product line but relate to multiple products 
as a result  there is a high degree of interdependency among our cash flows for levels below the consolidated entity and identifiable cash flows for an asset group separate from the consolidated entity are not meaningful 
therefore  the company s impairment test considered the consolidated entity as a single asset group 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
upon such an occurrence  recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows to which the assets relate  to the carrying amount 
if the asset is determined to be unable to recover its carrying value  it is written down to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows  appraised values or other information available in the market  depending on the nature of the assets 
methodologies for determining fair value are inherently based on estimates that may change  such as the useful lives of assets and our cash flow forecasts associated with certain assets 
a change in these estimates may result in impairment charges  which would impact our operating results 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets using the methodology prescribed in sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that we not amortize goodwill  but instead subject it to impairment tests on at least an annual basis and whenever circumstances suggest that they may be impaired 
these impairment tests are also dependent on management s forecasts  which frequently change 
a change in our forecasts may result 
table of contents in impairment charges 
sfas requires the company to perform a two step impairment test 
under the first step of the goodwill impairment test  we are required to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and we do not perform the second step 
if the results of the first step impairment test indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit does not exceed its carrying amount  then the second step of the goodwill impairment test is required 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the impairment loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
we determined that we have one reporting unit under sfas we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the end of each august fiscal month 
the results of the impairment test performed during the year ended december  indicated that the goodwill of the company was not impaired as the fair value of the company exceeded its carrying amount  including goodwill 
while we believe that our goodwill was not impaired at december   declines in our market capitalization subsequent to the balance sheet date could be an early indication that goodwill may become impaired in the future 
as such  it is probable that we will be required to perform an interim goodwill impairment test as of the end of our first quarter of restructuring charges we record restructuring charges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with disposal activities  which requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  in contrast to the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
restructuring costs were related to the downsizing of operations and primarily consisted of specific charges that had been incurred or were to be incurred with no future economic benefit 
these charges included costs related to personnel severance  continuing lease obligations for vacant facilities  and certain contract termination penalties and other shutdown costs 
calculation of the restructuring reserves includes management s judgment regarding closed facilities  which include assumptions about the length of time it will take for facilities to be subleased as well as the likely sublease income amount 
changes in these estimates may impact our operating results 
income taxes we record a deferred income tax asset in jurisdictions where the company generates a loss 
we also record a valuation allowance against these deferred income tax assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  when  in management s judgment  it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future 
we record uncertain tax positions under the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin and apply fsp fin  definition of settlement in fasb interpretation  to clarify when a tax position has been settled under paragraph b of fin we recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the positions 
under these provisions  we must assume that the taxing authority will examine the income tax position and will have full knowledge of all relevant information 
for each income tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  we then assess the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
unrecognized tax positions  if ever recognized in the financial statements  are recorded in the statement of operations as part of the income tax provision 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
slow moving and obsolete inventory are written down quarterly based on a comparison of on hand quantities to historical and projected usages 
additionally  reserves for non cancelable open purchase orders for components we are obligated to purchase in excess of projected usage  or for open purchase orders 
table of contents where the market price is lower than the purchase order price  are recorded as other accrued expenses on the balance sheet 
calculation of inventory write downs is based on management s assumptions regarding projected usage of each component  which are subject to changes in market demand 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we establish the allowance for doubtful accounts using the specific identification method and also provide a reserve in the aggregate 
our estimates for calculating the aggregate reserve are based on historical information 
any changes to our assumptions or estimates may impact our operating results 
business combinations we account for our acquisitions utilizing the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method of accounting  the total consideration paid is allocated to the underlying assets and liabilities  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
determining the fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities  identifiable intangible assets in particular  is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to estimates of revenue growth rates  estimates of rates of return  royalty rates  and determination of appropriate discount rates 
these assumptions are generally made based on available historical information 
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives

eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption prohibited 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact  if any  of eitf on our consolidated financial statements 
on august   the sec announced that it will issue for comment a proposed roadmap regarding the potential use by us issuers of financial statements prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs 
ifrs is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the international accounting standards board iasb 
under the proposed roadmap  the company could be required in fiscal to prepare financial statements in accordance with ifrs  and the sec will make a determination in regarding the mandatory adoption of ifrs 
we have not yet assessed the impact that this potential change would have on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
this fsp specifies that issuers that have convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
this fsp is effective for financial statements issued in fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  calendar year  and should be applied retrospectively to all past periods presented even if the instrument has matured  has been converted  or has otherwise been extinguished as of the fsp s effective date 
we have determined that fsp apb does not 
table of contents currently have a material impact on our financial statements as our existing convertible debt instruments are not required to be settled in cash  nor do they give us an option to settle in cash  upon conversion 
in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fsp no 
determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
fsp no 
amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets to include an entity s historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements  adjusted for entity specific factors  even when there is likely to be substantial cost or material modifications 
fsp no 
states that in the absence of historical experience an entity should use assumptions that market participants would make regarding renewals or extensions  adjusted for entity specific factors 
the guidance for determining the useful life of intangible assets included in this fsp will be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date of january  we are in the process of evaluating the impact  if any  of fsp no 
on our consolidated financial statements

table of contents results of operations the years ended december   december  and december  represent week years 
the following table represents our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods presented fiscal year ended december  december  december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expense engineering and quality assurance expense amortization of intangibles restructuring costs asset impairment loss from operations interest income interest expense other income expense  net loss before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes loss before equity in earnings of joint venture equity in earnings of joint venture  net of tax net loss comparison of fiscal year ended december  with fiscal year ended december  the company s results for the year ended december  improved  with sales increasing and loss from operations decreasing from the prior year 
our international operations experienced favorable foreign currency fluctuations which contributed to the results 
in addition  our results improved due to leverage on increased sales volume  benefits from product rationalization actions and business mix 
net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a result of the strengthening of the functional currencies at our international locations  primarily the euro and swiss franc  our consolidated revenue levels increased by approximately million during the year ended december  as compared with a substantial portion of our european revenue is transacted in foreign currencies such as the euro  the swiss franc  and the british pound 
as these currencies strengthened on average over the us dollar in  our consolidated net sales were favorably impacted for the year ending december  net sales were also favorably impacted by growth in the renewable energy inverter market  offset by decreases in the smart motor control market due to product rationalization efforts instituted by the company  and by decreases across the industrial and computer office equipment markets 

table of contents net sales for our two product lines were as follows  in millions year ended december  year ended december  embedded products power systems total net sales by customer category were as follows  in millions year ended december  year ended december  oems distributors service providers total no customer accounted for more than of our sales during the years ended december  and december  we have redefined our end markets based on the customers we serve  and have reclassified certain customers 
our other end market category includes the smart motor control market 
net sales for the years ended december  and december  by end markets under this new classification were as follows year ended december  december  network telecom equipment industrial equipment computer and office equipment renewable energy other total our combined year end day and day backlog were as follows  in millions year ended december  year ended december  combined day backlog combined day backlog we generally sell our products pursuant to purchase orders rather than long term contracts 
day backlog consists of purchase orders on hand having delivery dates scheduled within the next six months 
our backlog may not necessarily be a reliable indicator of future revenue because our customers are able to cancel or modify their orders up to days prior to delivery up to days prior to delivery without penalty 
in addition  a significant portion of our revenues is derived from turns business that is  revenues from orders that are booked and shipped within the same reporting period 
since a portion of our business is engaged in the design  manufacture and sale of ac dc products that are customized to the particular customer  lead times can be longer and orders may be booked earlier than they would be for our standard products 
our bookings were not significantly impacted by any new vendor managed inventory vmi programs during the year ended december  under 
table of contents a vmi program  we manufacture products for our customers based on their forecast 
as a result  the booking and billing occur simultaneously upon use of the product  and therefore there is always a book to bill ratio of for these programs 
we may bring additional vmi programs on line in the future  which would result in higher turns business  lower backlog  and higher finished goods inventory 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million compared with a gross profit of million for the year ended december  our gross margin increased to for the year ended december  from a gross margin of for the same period in gross margin during the year ended december  was favorably impacted by higher sales volume  favorable product mix and gross margin improvement initiatives 
we also recorded million in cost of goods sold related to the write off of excess inventory and other inventory adjustments during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in selling expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  selling expense decreased primarily as a result of the restructuring plan and related cost reduction efforts implemented throughout and fully realized during these savings were partially offset by increased commissions related to increased sales into the renewable energy market  one time severance charges recorded during the year ended december   and as well as unfavorable variances resulting from foreign currency fluctuations 
administrative expense increased million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in expense during this period was due to approximately million in one time severance charges related to the reorganization of the company s management personnel in north america  approximately million in legal fees and costs related to the extension of the million pwer bridge loan and the synqor patent infringement litigation  and million increase in provision for bad debts as a result of certain customer issues associated with the global economic slowdown 
in addition  the translation of the functional currencies at our international locations to our reporting currency of the us dollar negatively impacted our expense levels by approximately million as the us dollar weakened against most other foreign currencies during as compared with these increases in administrative expense was offset in part by reductions in legal fees of approximately million related to the patent infringement litigation against artesyn technologies incurred for the year ended december   and by savings realized during related to the company s restructuring plan 
engineering and quality assurance expense 
engineering and quality assurance expense decreased million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  engineering and quality assurance expense decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in engineering expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in quality assurance expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the decreases in engineering and quality assurance expense 
table of contents were primarily a result of the restructuring plan and related cost reduction efforts implemented during  whose savings were fully realized during amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets decreased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to certain intangibles reaching the end of their amortizable life 
restructuring charge and asset impairment 
no restructuring or asset impairment charges were recorded during the year ended december  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives 
we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually at the end of each fiscal august  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we calculated the estimated fair value of our company as the amount that we would receive to sell our company as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants as of august using two acceptable valuation methods 
first  we performed a discounted cash flow analysis using forward looking projections of our estimated future operating results 
second  we used the market approach which estimated the value of the company at august based on market multiples of guideline public companies and market multiples from recent comparatively sized sale transactions 
based on the result of each method and a comparison of the quantitative assumptions between the methods  we concluded that the fair value of our company exceeded its carrying value at the end of fiscal august and therefore  goodwill was not impaired as of our annual test date 
in addition to the testing above  which is done on an annual basis  management considers whether certain impairment indicators are present in assessing whether the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may be impaired 
management s considerations include i forecasts that demonstrate continuing declines in the cash flow of the company or inability of the company to improve its operations to forecasted levels and ii a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an entity or iii the book value of our shareholders equity continues to be significantly in excess of our market capitalization 
the risk of goodwill impairment losses increases to the extent that our market capitalization declines 
a decrease in our market capitalization resulting from a short term decrease in our stock price  or a negative long term performance outlook  as well as a variety of other impairment indicators  could cause the carrying value of the company to exceed its fair value  which may result in an impairment loss 
given the current economic environment  we have and will continue to monitor the need to test our intangibles for impairment as required by sfas no 
during the year ended december   we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with disposal activities 
we recorded approximately million related to severance payments for a reduction in headcount of approximately employees  million as contract termination costs related to facility closures and downsizing  and million related to consolidation of excess facilities and other contract termination costs 
the charges were in part a result of our plan to restructure our organization domestically  as we move certain functions to our other existing facilities in low cost locations 
as a result of the restructuring  we recorded asset impairment charges of million for the year ended december   in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
these charges were primarily incurred by our north american facilities and were related to leasehold improvements  computer software and manufacturing equipment at facilities whose operations are being closed or downsized 

table of contents loss from operations 
as a result of the items above  loss from operations decreased million to a loss of million for the year ended december  from an operating loss of million for the same period in interest income expense  net 
net interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to net interest expense of million for the same period in the net interest expense recorded during the year ended december  related to higher debt levels compared to prior year  along with the write off of million debt issue costs and debt discount related to the million loan  and interest related to credit facilities and long term debt obligations 
the resulting increase in net interest expense for the year ended december  was a result of a decrease in interest income as compared with the same period in the decrease in interest income was primarily due to short term investments sold during the year ended december  which were in place and earning interest during the same period in gain on extinguishment of debt 
gain on extinguishment of debt of million for the year ended december  was recorded as a result of the repurchase of million of outstanding convertible debt during the fourth quarter other income expense  net 
net other expense was million for the year ended december   compared with net other income of million for the year ended december  net other expense during included approximately million expense related to the write off of a loan to a foreign supplier and a million investment in a privately held company  as well as approximately million related to foreign currency transaction losses 
net other income during included a million gain on the sale of an equity investment the company held in one of its publicly held asian contract manufacturers as well as approximately million in net gains related to foreign currency fluctuations 
provision for income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes was million for the year ended december  compared to a provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december  included in our provision for both years ended december  and december  was approximately million of interest related to unrecognized tax benefits 
during the year ended december   we reversed certain reserves for uncertain tax positions of approximately million upon expiration of a tax statute as well as due to a closed tax audit 
although we record deferred income tax assets in jurisdictions where we generate a loss for income tax purposes  we also record a valuation allowance against these deferred income tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
when  in management s judgment  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as a result  we may record no tax benefit in jurisdictions where we incur a loss  but record tax expense in jurisdictions where we record taxable income and have no net operating loss nol carryforward 
as a result  few meaningful comparisons can be made on our consolidated tax rates between periods 
in  we recorded a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million compared to million recorded during the same period in equity in earnings of joint venture 
during through fiscal  we impaired our equity investment in our joint venture in asia as a result of our analysis of the future discounted cash flows combined with other impairment indicators 
however  during march  we received a cash dividend of million from the joint venture  representing a return on our investment 
the cash dividend along with million dividend receivable related to a declared dividend not yet paid  and approximately million related to our share in the earnings of the joint venture for the year ended december  were recorded in equity in earnings of joint venture during the year ended december  
table of contents comparison of fiscal year ended december  with fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in sales was attributable to our acquisition of the power electronics group during the fourth quarter of as well as organic volume growth in sales across most market segments 
included in the results for the year ended december  is weeks of activity related to the power electronics group  or million of net sales 
in we announced several significant new customers in the server storage industry and these customers generated a higher volume of sales for  providing an associated revenue increase 
during  there was significant growth in the renewable energy inverter and smart motor controls markets  which represented approximately of the year over year growth 
net sales for our two product lines were as follows  in millions year ended december  year ended december  embedded products power systems total net sales by customer category were as follows  in millions year ended december  year ended december  oems distributors service providers total cisco systems and its contract manufacturers accounted for less than ten percent of our sales in and million or of our sales in no other customer accounted for more than of our sales during these periods 
we have redefined our end markets and reclassified certain customers 
net sales for the years ended december  and december  by end markets under this new classification were as follows year ended december  december  network telecom equipment industrial equipment computer and office equipment other total our combined year end day and day backlog were as follows  in millions year ended december  year ended december  combined day backlog combined day backlog 
table of contents the combined backlog as of december  contained a high level of orders on hand whose expected shipment dates had passed  as a result of shipping delays experienced by the acquired business prior to the date of acquisition 
during  we executed on customer orders and were able to decrease past due orders by approximately million 
gross profit

upon the first anniversary of the issuance of the notes beginning june   we will be required to comply with quarterly financial covenants that limit our total debt to not exceed the greater of million or three times ebitda  require our cash and cash equivalents to exceed million  and require our tangible net worth to exceed million 
we are in compliance with the financial covenants under the senior secured convertible notes and we believe we will be in compliance at each covenant measurement date through the end of fiscal however  our continued ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and there is no assurance that we will remain in compliance with our financial covenants 
given the challenges in the current economic environment  we may experience softening of revenues and lower operating income than projected for additionally because of the tightened credit environment  some of our customers could delay payments or may not have the same purchasing power  leading to lower cash flows  revenues and profitability than currently projected for in addition  we are exposed to risks of foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely impact our compliance with certain of our debt covenants 
during the first fiscal quarter of  we announced a plan to further reduce costs in response to demand uncertainty associated with the global economic slowdown

if we do not attain our projected operating results and we are unsuccessful in implementing some or all of these  we may not be in compliance with one or more of our financial covenants 
upon the occurrence of certain defaults under any of the agreements  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding there under to be immediately due and payable 
if the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings  we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and long term debt 
however  if required  we would seek waivers of any such covenant 
table of contents violations 
any future debt that we incur may contain covenants that are restrictive to our financial flexibility or operations

the long term notes payable agreements require our subsidiary to provide certain financial reports to the lender but do not require compliance with any financial covenants 
we currently anticipate that our total capital expenditures for will be in the range of to million primarily for manufacturing equipment and process improvements  equipment related to research and development and product development  additions and upgrades to our facilities and information technology infrastructure  and other administrative requirements 
however  the amount of these anticipated capital expenditures likely will change during the year based on changes in expected revenues  our financial condition and the general economic climate 
based on current plans and business conditions  we believe our existing working capital and borrowing capacity  coupled with the funds that we expect to generate from our operations  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
we will continue to evaluate our liquidity position and explore alternatives to maximize our position and we may determine to raise additional funding through the issuance of equity or incurrence of debt 
in addition  if the subsidiary debt in default with its covenants is called by the bank it may be necessary to raise additional equity or debt 
we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
off balance sheet arrangements 
below we identify and disclose all of our significant off balance sheet arrangements and related party transactions 
we do not utilize special purpose entities or have any known financial relationships with other companies special purpose entities 
operating leases 
we enter into operating leases where the economic climate is favorable 
the liquidity impact of operating leases generally is not material

we have purchase commitments for materials  supplies  services  and property  plant and equipment as part of the normal course of business 
commitments to purchase inventory at above market prices have been reserved 
certain supply contracts may contain penalty provisions for early termination 
based on current expectations  we do not believe that we are reasonably likely to incur any material amount of penalties under these contracts 
other contractual obligations 
we do not have material financial guarantees that are reasonably likely to affect liquidity 

table of contents related parties 
we have entered into certain transactions  or have other arrangements with related parties 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part iv  item summary of contractual obligations and commitments 
as of december   we had not entered into any non cancelable open purchase orders 
a summary of our future contractual payments related to lease obligations and long term debt is as follows in millions year ending december  operating leases long term debt obligations estimated interest obligations total and thereafter total our restructuring reserve at december  includes approximately million relating to the above operating lease commitments 
the company intends to seek sub leases for unused facilities 
we calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows for fixed rate term debt  we calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates  for variable rate term debt  we calculated interest based on the most recent applicable interest rates in effect 
for the year ended december   our calculation of estimated interest payments includes million of interest payments related to a million credit agreement held at a subsidiary of the company  payable through that was reclassified from long term debt to current liabilities at december  as we did not seek to obtain a waiver for our noncompliance with a financial covenant requiring a maximum percentage of debt to equity and consider the debt potentially callable by the bank 
at december   we also had recorded a tax liability of million related to uncertain tax positions recorded under fin this amount has been excluded from the summary table of contractual obligations and commitments because we could not reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with our fin liabilities 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates on outstanding financial debt instruments and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
debt 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from financial debt instruments that we enter 
we may also enter into derivative financial instrument transactions  such as swaps  in order to manage or reduce our exposure to interest rate changes related to our indebtedness 
however  under no circumstances do we enter into derivative or other financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in market interest rates related to our outstanding debt 
for example  in europe our variable long term debt bears interest on borrowings outstanding at various time intervals and is based on the euro interbank offered rate euribor 
our principal risk with respect to our variable long term debt is to changes in this market rate 
the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates for our credit facilities and long term debt obligations at december  by expected maturity dates 
the 
table of contents information is presented in us dollar equivalents  our reporting currency  and parenthetically in eurodollar or swiss francs  where applicable 
additionally  the us dollar equivalent carrying value of eurodollars or swiss francs denominated debt is sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates 
however  a change in the us dollar exchange rate against these currencies would not be expected to have a significant effect on our future earnings 
expected maturity date fair value thereafter total amounts in millions  except for percentages credit facilities variable rate eur average interest rate variable rate chf average interest rate long term debt fixed rate usd average interest rate fixed rate eur average interest rate foreign currency 
a significant portion of our business operations are conducted in various countries in europe and asia 
as a result  we have a certain degree of market risk with respect to our cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency  including inter company transactions 
historically  we have not actively engaged in substantial exchange rate hedging activities  and at december   we had not entered into any significant foreign exchange contracts
