index to financial statements outlook the performance of acuity brands  like most companies  is influenced by a multitude of factors such as the health of the economy  including employment  credit availability  and consumer confidence 
during the company s fiscal  major economies and financial markets throughout the world experienced unprecedented volatility  creating uncertainty both for consumers and businesses 
as a result  construction activity in the us  both non residential and residential  declined significantly during fiscal the vitality of the company s business is determined by underlying economic factors such as employment levels  credit availability  consumer demand  commodity costs  and government policy  particularly as it impacts capital formation and risk taking by businesses and commercial developers 
as such  it is difficult at this time to precisely forecast the direction or intensity of future economic activity in general and more specifically with respect to overall construction demand 
key indicators continue to signal declines for north american non residential construction activity 
accordingly  management s expectation is that in the percentage decline in the overall markets it serves will be in the mid teens 
the company s backlog at the end of the fiscal was down percent compared to the prior year 
while prices for components and commodities  particularly for steel and petroleum  declined from their record highs in the summer and fall of  volatility in pricing for these products could once again occur and possibly place pressure on the company s margins 
management believes that competitive forces in the current market environment will not allow the company to pass along more than commodity cost increases or to significantly retain current pricing on commodity sensitive products should those specific commodity costs sharply decline 
although management believes pricing is likely to become more competitive in certain channels and geographies  the negative impact is expected to be offset through productivity improvements and lower material  component  and freight costs 
during fiscal  the company expects to realize approximately million of annualized benefits from the streamlining actions taken in fiscal of which approximately million of benefits were realized during fiscal these actions related to the consolidation of certain manufacturing operations and a reduction in workforce 
the company initiated such actions in an effort to continue to redeploy and invest resources in other areas where the company believes it can create greater value for all stakeholders and accelerate profitable growth opportunities  including a continued focus on industry leading product innovation incorporating sustainable design  relighting  and customer connectivity 
in addition to the recent acquisitions which significantly increased the company s presence in the fast growing lighting controls market  management believes the execution of the company s strategies to accelerate investments in innovative and energy efficient products  enhance services to its customers  and expand market presence in key sectors such as home centers and the renovation and relight market will provide growth opportunities  which should enable the company to outperform the overall markets it serves 
additionally  management believes these actions and investments will position the company to meet or exceed its long term financial goals 
the company expects cash flow from operations to remain strong in and intends to invest approximately million in capital expenditures during the year 
also  the company estimates the annual tax rate to approximate for although fiscal results are expected to be negatively impacted by current economic conditions  management remains very positive about the long term potential of the company and its ability to outperform the market 
management continues to position the company to optimize short term performance while investing in and deploying resources to further the company s long term profitable growth opportunities 
looking beyond the current environment  management believes the lighting and lighting related industry will experience solid growth over the next decade  particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront  and that the company is well positioned to fully participate in this growing industry

sfas no 
permits companies  at their election  to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period

critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses the financial condition and results of operations as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventory valuation  depreciation  amortization and the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  share based compensation expense  medical  product warranty  and other reserves  litigation  and environmental matters 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its substantial historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management discusses the development of accounting estimates with the company s audit committee 
see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the accounting policies of acuity brands 
the management of acuity brands believes the following represent the company s critical accounting estimates inventories inventories include materials  direct labor  and related manufacturing overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out or average cost basis or market 
management reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on estimated future demand and current market conditions 
a significant change in customer demand or market conditions could render certain inventory obsolete and thus could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results in the period the change occurs 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the company reviews goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fiscal fourth quarter or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that the fair value of the long lived asset is below its carrying value 
all other long lived and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on either discounted future cash

index to financial statements flows or other appropriate fair value methods 
the evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment requires management to use significant judgments and estimates in accordance with us gaap including  but not limited to  projected future net sales  operating results  and cash flow 
although management currently believes that the estimates used in the evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are reasonable  differences between actual and expected net sales  operating results  and cash flow and or changes in the discount rate or theoretical royalty rate could cause these assets to be deemed impaired 
if this were to occur  the company would be required to charge to earnings the write down in value of such assets  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position  but not its cash flows from operations 
goodwill the company is comprised of one reporting unit with a goodwill balance of million 
in determining the fair value of the company s reporting unit  the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires significant assumptions about discount rates as well as short and long term growth or decline rates  in accordance with us gaap 
the company utilized an estimated discount rate of as of june   based on the capital asset pricing model  which considers the updated risk free interest rate  beta  market risk premium  and entity specific size premium 
short term growth or decline rates are based on management s forecasted financial results which consider key business drivers such as specific revenue growth initiatives  market share changes  growth or decline in non residential and residential construction markets  and general economic factors such as credit availability and interest rates 
the company calculates the discounted cash flows using a year period with a terminal value and compares this calculation to the discounted cash flows generated over a year period to ensure reasonableness 
the long term growth rate used in determining terminal value is estimated at for the company and is primarily based on the company s understanding of projections for expected long term growth in non residential construction  the company s key market 
during fiscal  the company performed an evaluation of the fair value of goodwill 
the analysis included downward adjustments to the company s revenue forecasts and related short term growth rates compared to the prior year evaluation 
the goodwill analysis did not result in an impairment charge as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit continues to exceed the carrying value by such a significant amount that any reasonably likely change in the assumptions used in the analysis  including revenue growth rates and the discount rate  would not cause the carrying value to exceed the estimated fair value for the reporting unit as determined under the step one goodwill impairment analysis 
indefinite lived intangible assets the company s indefinite lived intangible assets consist of five unamortized trade names with an aggregate carrying value of approximately million 
management utilizes significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of these unamortized trade names using a fair value model based on discounted future cash flows in accordance with us gaap 
future cash flows associated with each of the company s unamortized trade names are calculated by applying a theoretical royalty rate a willing third party would pay for use of the particular trade name to estimated future net sales 
the present value of the resulting after tax cash flow is management s current estimate of the fair value of the trade names 
this fair value model requires management to make several significant assumptions  including estimated future net sales  the royalty rate  and the discount rate 
future net sales and short term growth or decline rates are estimated for each particular trade name based on management s forecasted financial results which consider key business drivers such as specific revenue growth initiatives  market share changes  expected growth or decline in non residential and residential construction markets  and general economic factors such as credit availability and interest rates 
the long term growth rate used in determining terminal value is estimated at for the company and is primarily based on the company s understanding of projections for expected long term growth in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements non residential construction  the company s key market 
the theoretical royalty rate is estimated using a factor of operating profit margins and management s assumptions regarding the amount a willing third party would pay to use the particular trade name 
differences between expected and actual results can result in significantly different valuations 
if future operating results are unfavorable compared with forecasted amounts  the company may be required to reduce the theoretical royalty rate used in the fair value model 
a reduction in the theoretical royalty rate would result in lower expected future after tax cash flow in the valuation model 
as with goodwill noted above  the company utilized an estimated discount rate of as of june   based on the capital asset pricing model  which considers the updated risk free interest rate  beta  market risk premium  and entity specific size premium 
all of these assumptions are subject to change based on unforeseen factors by management due to the inherent uncertainty of the global economic and political environment at large 
during fiscal  the company performed an evaluation of the fair value of its five unamortized trade names 
the company s adjusted expected revenues are based on recent lighting market growth or decline estimates for fiscal through the company also included revenue growth estimates based on current initiatives expected to help the company improve performance 
during fiscal  estimated theoretical royalty rates ranged between and 
the indefinite lived intangible asset analysis did not result in an impairment charge as the fair values exceeded the carrying values by a significant amount except for the mark lighting trade name which has a fair value that exceeds its million carrying value by approximately 
the estimated fair values of the indefinite lived intangible assets  other than the mark lighting trade name  exceed the carrying values by such a significant amount that any reasonably likely change in the assumptions used in the analyses  including revenue growth rates and the discount rate  would not cause the carrying values to exceed the estimated fair values as determined by the fair value analyses 
the company determined that any estimated potential impairment related to the mark lighting trade name based on reasonably likely changes in the assumptions would not be material to the company s financial results  trend of earnings  or financial position 
self insurance the company self insures  up to certain limits  traditional risks including workers compensation  comprehensive general liability  and auto liability 
the company s self insured retention for each claim involving workers compensation  comprehensive general liability including product liability claims  and auto liability is limited to million per occurrence of such claims 
a provision for claims under this self insured program  based on the company s estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred  is revised and recorded annually 
the estimate is derived from both internal and external sources including but not limited to the company s independent actuary 
acuity brands is also self insured up to certain limits for certain other insurable risks  primarily physical loss to property million per occurrence and business interruptions resulting from such loss lasting three days or more in duration 
insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
acuity brands is fully self insured for certain other types of liabilities  including environmental  product recall  and patent infringement 
the actuarial estimates calculated are subject to uncertainty from various sources  including  among others  changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  legislation  and economic conditions 
although acuity brands believes that the actuarial estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect the company s self insurance obligations  future expense and cash flow 
the company is also self insured for the majority of its medical benefit plans with individual claims limited to  the company estimates its aggregate liability for claims incurred by applying a lag factor to the company s historical claims and administrative cost experience 
the appropriateness of the company s lag factor is evaluated and revised  if necessary  annually 
although management believes that the current estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to claim reporting patterns  plan designs  legislation  and general economic conditions could materially affect the company s medical benefit plan liabilities  future expense and cash flow

product warranty and recall costs the company records an allowance for the estimated amount of future warranty costs when the related revenue is recognized  primarily based on historical experience of identified warranty claims 
excluding costs related to recalls due to faulty components provided by third parties  historical warranty costs have been within expectations 
however  there can be no assurance that future warranty costs will not exceed historical amounts 
if actual future warranty costs exceed historical amounts  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results and cash flow in future periods

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the company is exposed to worldwide market risks that may impact the consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of income  and consolidated statements of cash flows due primarily to changing interest and foreign exchange rates as well as volatility in commodity prices 
the following discussion provides additional information regarding the market risks of acuity brands 
interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations expose the variable rate debt of the company to changes in interest expense and cash flows 
at august   the variable rate debt of the company was solely comprised of the million long term industrial revenue bonds 
a increase in market interest rates at august   would have resulted in a de minimus amount of additional annual after tax interest expense 
a fluctuation in interest rates would not affect interest expense or cash flows related to the company s fixed rate debt which includes the million publicly traded fixed rate notes and the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements august  outstanding balance of million on the three year unsecured promissory note 
a increase in market interest rates at august   would have decreased the estimated fair value of these debt obligations by approximately million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in this form k  for additional information regarding the company s debt 
foreign exchange rates 
the majority of net sales  expense  and capital purchases of the company are transacted in us dollars 
however  exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuation exists due to the company s operations in canada  where a portion of products sold are sourced from the united states 
a hypothetical decline in the canadian dollar of would negatively impact operating profit by approximately million 
also  a portion of the goods sold in the united states are manufactured in mexico 
a hypothetical increase in the mexican peso would negatively impact operating profits by approximately million 
the impact of these hypothetical currency fluctuations has been calculated in isolation from any response the company would undertake to address such exchange rate changes in the company s foreign markets 
commodity prices 
the company utilizes a variety of raw materials and components in its production process including petroleum based products  steel  and aluminum 
in fiscal  the company purchased approximately  tons of steel and aluminum 
the company estimates that less than of the raw materials purchased are petroleum based and that approximately million gallons of diesel fuel was consumed in fiscal failure to effectively manage future increases in the costs of these items could adversely affect the ability to maintain or increase operating margins
