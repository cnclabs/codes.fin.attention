item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a delaware holding company organized in that owns three regional airlines chautauqua airlines  inc  chautauqua airlines  our operator of to seat aircraft  shuttle america corporation shuttle america  our operator of to seat aircraft  and republic airline inc republic airline  our operator of to seat aircraft 
as of december   our subsidiaries offered scheduled passenger service on approximately  flights daily to cities in states  canada  mexico  and jamaica pursuant to code share agreements with amr corp  the parent of american airlines  inc american  continental airlines  inc continental  delta air lines  inc delta  midwest airlines  inc 
midwest  mokulele flight service  inc mokulele  united air lines  inc 
united  and us airways  inc us airways  collectively referred to as our partners 
we began flying for midwest and mokulele in october and november  respectively 
currently  we provide our partners with regional jet service  operating as americanconnection  continental express  delta connection  midwest connect  mokulele airlines  united express  or us airways express  including service out of their hubs and focus cities 
unless the context indicates otherwise  the terms the company  we  us  or our  refer to republic airways holdings inc and our subsidiaries 
we have long term  fixed fee regional jet code share agreements with each of our partners that are subject to our maintaining specified performance levels 
pursuant to these fixed fee agreements  which provide for minimum aircraft utilization at fixed rates  we are authorized to use our partners two character flight designation codes to identify our flights and fares in our partners computer reservation systems  to paint our aircraft in the style of our partners  to use their service marks and to market ourselves as a carrier for our partners 
in addition  in connection with a marketing agreement among delta  continental and northwest airlines  certain of the routes that we fly using delta s and continental s flight designator codes are also flown under northwest s designator code 
our fixed fee agreements eliminate our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices  fare competition and passenger volumes 
our development of relationships with multiple major airlines has enabled us to reduce our dependence on any single airline  allocate our overhead more efficiently among our partners and reduce the cost of our services to our partners 
in january  we entered into a fixed fee code share agreement with frontier airlines  inc frontier 
in april  frontier rejected the agreement 
frontier s rejection of the agreement was prompted by its filing for chapter bankruptcy protection on april  as of the bankruptcy date  we were operating of the e aircraft to be provided under the terms of the agreement 
all e aircraft were removed from service with frontier during the second quarter of during we increased our operational fleet by two aircraft from to aircraft 
our operational fleet is comprised of e  seat aircraft  e  seat aircraft  and crj  seat aircraft 
during  we took delivery of e aircraft 
thirteen were placed into service for us airways and were placed into service for delta 
twenty four aircraft were removed from operations during the year 
fifteen seat e aircraft were removed from delta operations  two e aircraft were removed from charter service and seven seat crj aircraft were removed from continental operations 
all of the aircraft removed from service are under agreement to be sold or will be returned to the lessor in also during  we transitioned e aircraft from frontier to midwest and two e aircraft from delta to mokulele 
as of december   four e aircraft were not operating for our partners 
of these four aircraft  two are scheduled to go into operation for mokulele in and two are under short term agreement to operate for delta between march and september as of december   we have agreed to place into service an additional three  new e aircraft for delta during the first quarter of these aircraft are covered by firm orders with the aircraft manufacturer 
the company has options for e aircraft  which may be converted to options for e  e or e aircraft  which range in size from seats to seats 
we expect to reduce our e and crj fleets by a total of aircraft in under our continental agreement  we expect ten of the remaining crj aircraft to be removed from service and returned to the lessor during the final seven crj aircraft are under leases that expire during the first quarter of under our united agreement  seven e aircraft are scheduled to be removed in december we intend to sell or otherwise sublease these aircraft 
in october we and american reached an agreement to amend our airline services agreement 
a key term of this agreement calls for the removal of two of the e aircraft currently operating for american to be removed from service by june american will continue to reimburse us for the two aircraft as spares unless we sell  sublease or otherwise place the aircraft 
for the years ended december   and respectively  delta accounted for approximately  and  us airways accounted for approximately  and  united accounted for approximately  and and american accounted for approximately  and of our regional airline services revenues 
for the years ending december  and continental accounted for approximately and and frontier accounted for approximately and of our regional airline services revenues

revenue under our fixed fee arrangements with our partners  we receive fixed fees  as well as reimbursement of specified costs on a gross basis with additional possible incentives from our partners for superior performance 
for the years ended december   and all of our regional airline services revenue was earned under our fixed fee arrangements 
the number of aircraft we operate and aircraft utilization are the most significant drivers of our revenue  as opposed to the number of passengers we carry or the fare the passengers pay 
operating expenses a brief description of the items included in our operating expenses line items follows 
wages and benefits this expense includes not only wages and salaries  but also expenses associated with various employee benefit plans  employee incentives  stock compensation  and payroll taxes 
these expenses will fluctuate based primarily on our level of operations changes in wage rates for contract and non contract employees and changes in costs of our benefit plans 
aircraft fuel as of december   approximately of our aircraft fuel is supplied directly by our code share partners  and thus we do not record expense or the related revenue for those gallons of fuel 
united started directly supplying fuel for certain locations in january all fuel related to the continental  frontier  midwest  mokulele and us airways operations is directly supplied as well 
we pass through all fuel costs relating to our american and delta operations  realizing both the expense and the revenue 
landing fees this expense consists of fees charged by airports for each aircraft landing 
under our current fixed fee agreements  we are reimbursed for the actual costs of landing fees 
aircraft and engine rent this expense consists of the costs of leasing aircraft and spare engines 
the leased aircraft and spare engines are operated under long term operating leases with third parties 
aircraft rent is reduced by the amortization of integration funding credits received from the aircraft manufacturer for parts and training 
the credits are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the respective lease of the aircraft 
maintenance and repair maintenance and repair expenses include all parts  materials  tooling and spares required to maintain our aircraft 
we have entered into long term maintenance power by the hour service contracts with third party maintenance providers under which we are charged fixed rates for each flight hour accumulated by all of our engines and some of the major airframe components 
the effect of such contracts is to reduce the volatility of aircraft maintenance expense over the term of the contract

depreciation and amortization this expense includes the depreciation of all fixed assets  including aircraft  and the amortization of the commuter slots that we own 
goodwill and intangibles with an indefinite life are required to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis 
if we determine the goodwill and intangibles are impaired  we are required to write off the amount of goodwill and intangibles that are impaired 
as of december  and  goodwill and intangibles totaled million and million respectively  net of amortization 
other this expense includes the costs of crew training  crew travel  airport  passenger and ground handling related expenses  all other lease expenses  professional fees  impairment loss and accrued aircraft return costs  gains and losses on disposal of assets and all other administrative  facilities and operational overhead expenses not included in other line items above

our commercial commitments at december  include letters of credit totaling million expiring within one year 
cash payments for interest were approximately million in tax payments in were not significant and we are not expecting significant payments in critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
under our fixed fee arrangements with american  delta  continental  midwest  mokulele  united and us airways  the company receives a fixed fee  as well as reimbursement of specified costs on a gross basis with additional possible incentives from our partners for superior service 
revenues are recognized in the period the service is provided  and we perform an estimate of the profit component based upon the information available at the end of the accounting period 
the reimbursement of specified costs  known as pass through costs  may include aircraft ownership cost  passenger liability and hull insurance  aircraft property taxes  fuel  landing fees and catering 
all revenue recognized under these contracts is presented at the gross amount billed for reimbursement pursuant to emerging issues tax force issue eitf no 
reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
under the company s code share agreements  the company is reimbursed an amount per aircraft designed to compensate the company for certain aircraft ownership costs 
in accordance with eitf no 
 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  the company has concluded that a component of its revenue under the agreement discussed above is rental income  inasmuch as the agreement identifies the right of use of a specific type and number of aircraft over a stated period of time 
the amount deemed to be rental income during fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively  and has been included in regional airline services revenue on the company s consolidated statements of income 
aircraft leases 
the company has aircraft that are leased from third parties 
in order to determine the proper classification of a lease as either an operating lease or a capital lease  the company must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
these estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
all of the company s aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases  which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the term of the related leases 
additionally  operating leases are not reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet and accordingly  neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company is responsible for all other maintenance costs of its aircraft and must meet specified return conditions upon lease expiration for both the airframes and engines 
the company recorded a million liability for the return conditions for the crj aircraft being returned to the lessor at december  impairments to long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
we review  at least annually  the estimated useful lives and salvage values for our owned aircraft and spare parts 
impairments to goodwill 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if a triggering event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the push down accounting in may the company has one reporting unit and all of the goodwill of million is assigned to that unit 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  the company makes a determination of the fair value of its business 
fair value is determined using a combination of an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon projections of future revenues  expenses  and cash flows discounted to their present value  and a market approach  which estimates fair value using market multiples of various financial measures compared to a set of comparable public companies in the regional airline industry 
an impairment loss will generally be recognized when the carrying amount of the net assets of the business exceeds its estimated fair value 
the valuation methodology and underlying financial information included in the company s determination of fair value require significant judgments to be made by management 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  market valuation comparisons to similar airlines  long term projections of future financial performance and the selection of appropriate discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows 
changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
during the second and third quarter of  the company performed an interim test of its goodwill 
factors deemed by management to have collectively constituted a potential triggering event included record high fuel prices  a softening us economy and the differences between market capitalization of our stock as compared to the book value of equity 
as of december   the company performed its annual assessment of the recoverability of its goodwill 
as a result of these assessments  no impairment was indicated 
the company s market capitalization was approximately million as compared to its book value of approximately million 
for the period subsequent to december   through the filing date of this form k  the company s market capitalization declined by an additional and continues to be well below book value 
due to the continued recessionary economic environment  as well as other uncertainties  the company may be required to record an impairment charge as early as the first quarter of the company will continue to monitor circumstances and events in future periods to determine whether additional goodwill impairment testing is warranted 
aircraft maintenance and repair 
we follow a method of expensing aircraft maintenance and repair costs as incurred 
however  maintenance and repairs for engines and airframe components under power by the hour contracts  such as engines  avionics  apus  wheels and brakes  are expensed as the aircraft are operated based upon actual hours or cycles flown 
deferred credit delta pre petition claim and surrendered warrants 
as a result of the delta amendment  in march  we recorded a deferred credit of million  which represented the net realizable value of the pre petition claim on the approval date by the bankruptcy court 
in addition  we recorded a deferred gain on the surrender of the warrants from delta of million  which was net of the write off of the previously reported unamortized deferred warrant charge of million 
the deferred credits for the proceeds of the pre petition claim and the gain on the surrender of the warrants totaling million will be amortized as an adjustment to revenue over term of the agreements with delta 
income taxes 
the company has generated significant net operating losses nols for federal income tax purposes primarily from accelerated depreciation on owned aircraft 
certain of our nols generated prior to july are subject to an annual limitation under internal revenue code section irc 
the annual limitation is based upon the enterprise value of the company on the irc ownership change date multiplied by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
if the utilization of deferred tax assets  and other carry forwards becomes uncertain in future years  we will be required to record a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets not expected to be utilized 
intangible commuter slots 
the company acquired commuter slots during at the new york laguardia and ronald reagan washington national airports from us airways 
the licensing agreement with the company and us airways for the laguardia commuter slots expired on december   but we maintain a security interest in the laguardia slots if us airways fails to perform under the current licensing agreement 
the estimated useful lives of these commuter slots were determined based upon the period of time cash flows are expected to be generated by the commuter slots and by researching the estimated useful lives of commuter slots or similar intangibles by other airlines 
in addition  an estimated residual value was determined using estimates of the expected fair value of the commuter slots at the end of the expected useful life
