item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business overview we generate our revenues primarily from sales of admission to our parks  food  merchandise and games inside our parks  and hotel rooms  food and other attractions outside our parks 
our principal costs and expenses  which include salaries and wages  advertising  maintenance  operating supplies  utilities and insurance  are relatively fixed and do not vary significantly with attendance 
in order to efficiently manage our properties  we created regional designations for our parks 
the northern region  which is the largest  includes cedar point and the adjacent soak city water park  kings island  canada s wonderland  dorney park  valleyfair  geauga lake s wildwater kingdom and michigan s adventure 
the southern region includes kings dominion  carowinds  worlds of fun and oceans of fun 
finally  our western region includes knott s berry farm  great america and the soak city water parks located in palm springs  san diego and adjacent to knott s berry farm 
this region also includes the management contract with gilroy gardens family theme park in gilroy  california and star trek the experience  an interactive adventure in las vegas  which closed to the public on september   after management concluded it would not renew a contract scheduled to expire on december  the results of operations of star trek the experience are not material to the consolidated financial statements

for additional information regarding adjusted ebitda  including a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to operating income the most comparable financial measure  see note in item  selected financial data  on page critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions during the normal course of business that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results or involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
application of the critical accounting policies described below involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates and assumptions  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to similar businesses 

table of contents accounting for business combinations business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions at the reporting unit  or park level  are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder  if any  recorded as goodwill 
the fair values are determined by management  taking into consideration information obtained during the due diligence process  valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts and other relevant information 
the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
the determination of fair values requires significant judgment both by management and outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
expenditures made to maintain such assets in their original operating condition are expensed as incurred  and improvements and upgrades are capitalized 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the composite method is used for the group of assets acquired as a whole in  as well as for the groups of like assets of each subsequent business acquisition 
the unit method is used for all individual assets purchased 
impairment of long lived assets the carrying values of long lived assets  including property and equipment  are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss may be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets  including disposition  are less than the carrying value of the assets 
the measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets 
fair value is generally determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
in order to determine if an asset has been impaired  assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level park level for which identifiable  independent cash flows are available 
the determination of both undiscounted and discounted cash flows requires management to make significant estimates and consider an anticipated course of action as of the balance sheet date 
subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted and discounted cash flows arising from changes in anticipated actions could impact the determination of whether impairment exists  the amount of the impairment charge recorded and whether the effects could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
long lived intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived trade names are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
goodwill and trade names have been assigned at the reporting unit  or park level  for purposes of impairment testing 
goodwill related to parks acquired prior to is annually tested for impairment as of october st 
we completed this review during the fourth quarter in and determined the goodwill was not impaired 
goodwill and trade names related to the paramount parks ppi acquisition in see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements is annually tested for impairment as of april st 
we completed this review during the second quarter in and determined that such goodwill and trade names were not impaired at that time 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in equity price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and slower growth rates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents an impairment loss may be recognized if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  which is estimated using both an income discounted cash flow and market approach 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these approaches 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
at the end of the fourth quarter of  due to present uncertainty surrounding the economy and general stock price volatility  and volatility in our unit price in particular  we concluded a triggering event had occurred indicating potential impairment and performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
at december  substantially all of our goodwill and trade name assets relate to the acquisition of the five parks in after performing a preliminary goodwill and trade names impairment test as of december   we recognized million of estimated goodwill impairment and million of trade names impairment  as the carrying values of goodwill and trade names for certain parks acquired in exceeded their fair values 
this impairment was driven mainly by an increase in our cost of capital in the fourth quarter of and lower projected growth rates for certain parks 
the preliminary estimate of the goodwill impairment charge will be refined in the first quarter of after valuation step procedures have been completed 
it is possible that our assumptions about future performance  as well as the economic outlook  and related conclusions regarding the valuation of our reporting units parks  could change adversely  which may result in additional impairment that would have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations  in future periods 
self insurance reserves reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance 
reserves are established for both identified claims and incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
such amounts are accrued for when claim amounts become probable and estimable 
reserves for identified claims are based upon our own historical claims experience and third party estimates of settlement costs 
reserves for ibnr claims  which are not material to our consolidated financial statements  are based upon our own claims data history  as well as industry averages 
all reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in facts and circumstances and adjustments are made as necessary 
derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are only used within our overall risk management program to manage certain interest rate and foreign currency risks from time to time 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the use of derivative financial instruments is accounted for according to financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and related amendments 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
derivative financial instruments used in hedging transactions are assessed both at inception and quarterly thereafter to ensure they are effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the related underlying exposures 

table of contents revenue recognition revenues on multi day admission tickets are recognized over the estimated number of visits expected for each type of ticket  and are adjusted periodically during the season 
all other revenues are recognized on a daily basis based on actual guest spending at our facilities  or over the park operating season in the case of certain marina dockage revenues and certain sponsorship revenues 
results of operations vs 
the following table presents key operating and financial information for the years ended december  and increase decrease amounts in thousands except per capita spending attendance per capita spending out of park revenues net revenues cash operating costs and expenses adjusted ebitda depreciation and amortization equity based compensation loss on impairment of goodwill and other intangibles   n m loss on impairment retirement of fixed assets operating income n m not meaningful consolidated net revenues totaled million in  increasing million  from million in  on strong operating results during the peak months of july and august 
the increase in net revenues reflects a  or  visit  increase in combined attendance  partially offset by a slight decrease in out of park revenues  including our resort hotels  and a decrease in average in park guest per capita spending 
in park guest per capita spending represents the amount spent per attendee to gain admission to a park plus all amounts spent while inside the park gates 
the decrease in average in park guest per capita spending is primarily due to a fundamental shift in the attendance mix in our southern region 
during the operating season  we experienced an increase in attendance in the southern region primarily due to a shift toward season pass admissions  which have historically had a lower per capita spending level associated with them 
offsetting some of the decrease in per capita spending in the southern region was an increase in per capita spending in our western region  while our northern region per capita spending was flat compared to attendance in our northern region increased primarily due to canada s wonderland  which introduced a record breaking ride in  as well as cedar point  kings island and michigan s adventure all experiencing attendance growth in these gains were partially offset by lost amusement park attendance resulting from the geauga lake restructuring 
our western region experienced a decrease in attendance of slightly more than during  due to softness throughout the second half of in that region 
out of park revenues  which represent the sale of hotel rooms  food  merchandise and other complimentary activities located outside of the park gates  decreased less than  or  operating costs and expenses  excluding depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges  decreased  or million  to million from million a year ago 
this decrease was in large part due to lower costs 
table of contents resulting from the restructuring of geauga lake and the closure of star trek on september   as well as a continued focus on controlling cash operating costs during the season 
during  we recognized losses of million on non cash impairment charges at geauga lake  million on the retirement of fixed assets across all properties  and million on the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets 
this compares to non cash impairment charges at geauga lake of million during the non cash impairment charges at geauga lake were due to a decision made in to operate geauga lake exclusively as a water park beginning in we are currently marketing excess real property at geauga lake 
further discussion of this transaction can be found in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded estimated non cash charges of million and million for impairment of goodwill and trade names  respectively  that were originally recorded when we acquired the parks in although the acquisition continues to meet our collective operating and profitability goals  the performance of certain acquired parks has fallen below our original expectations  which when coupled with a higher cost of capital  resulted in these impairment charges 
it is important to note that each of the acquired parks remains profitable  and that the goodwill and trade name write downs do not affect cash  ebitda or liquidity 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these impairment charges 
in  depreciation and amortization decreased million from  due primarily to lower depreciation at geauga lake resulting from the restructuring of that park after the season 
after lower depreciation and amortization  the non cash impairment charges and the retirement of fixed assets  operating income for was million compared with million in  representing a decrease 
interest expense and other expense  net  for decreased million to million from million in the decrease is due to a combination of lower interest rates on our variable rate debt  the new interest rate swaps that were entered into during the first quarter of  and a lower average balance on our revolving credit facilities during compared to a benefit for taxes of  was recorded in  consisting of a benefit to account for the tax attributes of our corporate subsidiaries of million and a provision for publicly traded partnership ptp taxes of million 
this compares with a total provision for taxes of million for  comprised of a million provision on our corporate subsidiaries and an million provision for ptp taxes 
after interest expense and provision for taxes  net income for the period totaled million  or per diluted limited partner unit  compared with a net loss of million  or per unit  a year ago 
because we strongly emphasize cash flow generation  a meaningful measure of our operating results is adjusted ebitda  which represents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and other non cash charges and credits for additional information regarding adjusted ebitda and a reconciliation to net income  see note in item  selected financial data  on page 
in  adjusted ebitda increased million  or  to million  while our adjusted ebitda margin improved basis points bps to from in the increase in margin in was due to increased attendance  strong operating results during the peak summer months of july and august  primarily in our northern region  and continued cost controls 
vs 
our results are not directly comparable to results due to the acquisition of ppi on june  since material changes to our statements of operations between those years are primarily due to this acquisition  we will also discuss operating results for on a same park basis compared to management believes this same park comparison is necessary to reduce the risk of reaching inaccurate conclusions about our full year results 

table of contents the following table presents key operating and financial information for the years ended december  and all properties a same park comparison b increase decrease amounts in thousands except per capita spending attendance per capita spending out of park revenues net revenues cash operating costs and expenses adjusted ebitda depreciation and amortization equity based compensation impairment loss on fixed assets    n m operating income n m not meaningful a includes results for all owned and or managed properties as of december  b same park comparison includes properties owned and operated for the full periods in and and excludes the newly acquired parks and corporate costs 
for same park comparisons in previous filings  corporate costs were included as a reduction of operating income 
for the current filing  comparisons made on a park level basis exclude all corporate costs 
all properties on a combined basis  including the ppi parks  consolidated net revenues totaled million in compared to million in excluding depreciation and other non cash charges  combined operating costs and expenses were million in versus million in after depreciation  amortization and the million impairment loss from the geauga lake restructuring  operating income for  on a combined basis  was million compared with million in interest expense and other expense  net  for increased million to million  primarily due to a full year of interest expense on the acquisition financing compared to only six months in a provision for taxes of million was recorded to account for the tax attributes of our corporate subsidiaries million and publicly traded partnership ptp taxes million 
this compares with a provision for taxes of for after interest expense and provision for taxes  combined net loss for totaled million  or per diluted limited partner unit  compared with net income of million  or per unit  in in  combined adjusted ebitda increased million to million  while our adjusted ebitda margin decreased to from in the decrease in margin in was primarily due to the timing of the acquisition in june  when combined results for the full year benefited from operating the new parks only during their peak months and avoided the operating costs of the first six months of the year 
included in the increase in adjusted ebitda of million was the settlement of a management contract dispute of approximately million 

table of contents same park comparison consolidated net revenues in on a same park basis increased to million from million in the increase in net revenues was the result of a increase in average in park guest per capita spending and a increase in out of park revenues  partially offset by a decline in combined attendance 
average per capita spending and out of park revenues  including hotels  increased steadily across all regions during the year 
the northern region produced increases in average per capita spending and out of park revenues  in large part due to the introduction of world class roller coasters at both cedar point and valleyfair 
this more than offset a slight decrease in attendance in the region 
excluding depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges  total cash operating costs and expenses  on a same park basis  decreased slightly to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to reduced cash operating costs at geauga lake in as a result of the restructuring  offset somewhat by higher operating costs at knott s berry farm 
for  depreciation and amortization expense on a same park basis increased million  or  due primarily to the accelerated depreciation on certain geauga lake assets in after higher depreciation  amortization and impairment losses  operating income for on a same park basis decreased to million from million in in  adjusted ebitda on a same park basis increased  or million  to million  due primarily to strong increases in operating profits at most of our northern region parks  including cedar point  dorney park and valleyfair 
additionally  this increase in operating profits includes the settlement of a management contract dispute of approximately million 
based on these results  our consolidated adjusted ebitda margin on a same park basis increased to in from in financial condition with respect to both liquidity and cash flow  we ended in sound condition 
the negative working capital ratio current liabilities divided by current assets of at december  is the result of our highly seasonal business 
receivables and inventories are at normally low seasonal levels and credit facilities are in place to fund current liabilities  capital expenditures and pre opening expenses as required 
operating activities net cash from operating activities in increased million to million compared with million in the increase in operating cash flows between years is primarily attributable to the improved operating results of our parks  lower interest and income tax payments  and a favorable change in working capital 
net cash from operating activities in increased million to million compared with million in the increase in operating cash flows between years is primarily attributable to the improved operating results of our legacy parks  largely offset by higher cash interest payments 
investing activities investing activities consist principally of acquisitions and capital investments we make in our parks and resort properties 
during  cash used for investing activities totaled million  compared to million in and  million in reflected in the total is million received from cbs corporation as final settlement of a purchase price working capital adjustment related to the acquisition of ppi 
the significant increase in cash for investing activities in was attributable to the acquisition of ppi 

table of contents historically  we have been able to improve our revenues and profitability by continuing to make substantial investments in our park and resort facilities 
this has enabled us to maintain or increase attendance levels  as well as generate increases in guest per capita spending and revenues from guest accommodations 
for the operating season  we are investing approximately million in capital improvements at our properties  with the highlight of the program being the addition of a million world class roller coaster at kings island 
the program will also include the addition of new roller coasters to the carowinds and world s of fun parks  and a new  gallon wave pool at valleyfair 
in addition to great new thrill rides  we are also investing in other capital improvements across our parks  including additional rides and attractions  restaurant renovations  new games  and other general improvements 
financing activities net cash utilized for financing activities totaled million in and compared to net cash from financing activities of  million in the significant increase in cash from financing activities in was attributable to borrowings necessary to fund the ppi acquisition 
capital resources in june  and as amended in august  in connection with the acquisition of the paramount parks  we entered into a new  million credit agreement with several banks and certain lenders party thereto the credit agreement 
in february  we took advantage of favorable market conditions and amended the credit agreement the amended agreement  reducing interest rate spreads on the term borrowings by bps 
the credit facilities provided under the february  amended and restated credit agreement include a  million us term loan  million in us revolving loan commitments  a million canadian term loan and million in canadian revolving loan commitments 
under the amended agreement  us denominated loans made under the us and canadian revolving loan commitments currently bear interest at a rate based on libor plus bps 
canadian denominated loans made under the canadian revolving commitments currently bear interest at a rate based on bankers acceptance plus bps or canadian prime plus bps 
all term debt currently bears interest at either a rate based on libor plus bps or a rate based on a prime rate plus bps 
the us term loan matures on august  and amortizes at a rate of million per year 
the canadian term loan matures on february  and amortizes at a rate of million per year 
the us revolving commitment and the canadian revolving commitment expire on august  the credit agreement also provides for the issuance of documentary and standby letters of credit 
at december   we had  million of variable rate term debt and million in borrowings under the revolving credit facilities 
after letters of credit  which totaled million at december   we had million of available borrowings under our revolving credit agreements 
during  we entered into several interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted billion of our us variable rate debt to a fixed rate of  after taking into account the february amendment to the credit agreement 
in january  we entered into several additional interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted another million of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate of 
during we also entered into two cross currency swap agreements to manage our foreign currency risk exposure on term debt borrowings related to our wholly owned canadian subsidiary 
in february  we terminated the two cross currency swaps and received million in cash upon termination 
we replaced these swaps with two new cross currency swap agreements  which effectively converted million of term debt  and the associated interest payments  from us dollar denominated debt at a rate of libor plus bps to fixed rate canadian dollar denominated debt 

table of contents of our total term debt  million is scheduled to mature in based on interest rates in effect at year end for variable rate debt  we expect our aggregate average cost of debt to approximate in and cash interest payments would approximate million in versus actual cash interest paid of million in the amended agreement includes customary covenants to monitor operating performance  as well as liquidity ratios that govern our partnership distributions 
the most restrictive of these ratios is the maximum consolidated leverage ratio 
at december   this ratio set forth in the amended agreement will decrease to x debt to ebitda  which if not met  will result in a suspension of our distribution 
after scheduled debt amortization of million in  our ebitda for would have to approximate million to meet the maximum consolidated leverage ratio  which  in light of current economic conditions and the negative general outlook may be difficult to achieve 
given this fact  as well as the uncertain credit environment  we continue to evaluate our capital structure and review various alternatives for reducing our debt levels 
we are considering a wide range of alternatives for reducing debt  including reconsidering the partnership s distribution policy based on our overall long term capital structure objectives  as well as the divestiture of excess land and select assets 
no decisions have yet been finalized on the distribution policy or any of the other alternatives being reviewed 
cash distributions in  at the current rate of per unit  would total approximately million  essentially in line with the distributions paid in credit facilities and cash flows from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet working capital needs  debt service and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes certain obligations on an undiscounted basis at december  in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital expenditures lease other obligations total represents maturities on long term debt obligations  plus contractual interest payments on all debt 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
represents contractual obligations in place at year end for the purchase of new rides and attractions 
obligations not denominated in us dollars have been converted based on the exchange rates existing on december  represents contractual lease and purchase obligations in place at year end 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant off balance sheet financing arrangements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk given the current uncertainty of the credit markets and our need to refinance our debt in the future  we are looking at a wide range of alternatives to reduce debt levels and reduce our leverage ratios 
as noted above  these alternatives include reconsidering the partnership s distribution policy  as well as the divestiture of excess land and select assets 
to the extent we are able to successfully execute on these alternatives  we believe it will have a positive impact on our leverage ratio  which in turn should benefit debt refinancing efforts 
no decisions have yet been finalized on the distribution policy or any of the other alternatives being considered 

table of contents we are exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates  and to a lesser extent on currency exchange rates on our operations in canada and  from time to time  on imported rides and equipment 
the objective of our financial risk management is to reduce the potential negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to acceptable levels 
we do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of interest rate swaps  which fix a portion of our variable rate long term debt  and variable rate borrowings under our revolving credit loans 
we mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exposure from the canadian dollar through the use of foreign currency denominated debt 
hedging of the us dollar denominated debt  used to fund a substantial portion of our net investment in our canadian operations  is accomplished through the use of cross currency swaps 
any gain or loss on the hedging instrument offsets the gain or loss on the underlying debt 
translation exposures with regard to our canadian operations are not hedged 
after considering the impact of interest rate swap agreements  at december    million of our outstanding long term debt represented fixed rate debt and million represented variable rate debt 
assuming an average balance on our revolving credit borrowings  the cash flow impact of a hypothetical one percentage point change in the applicable interest rates on our variable rate debt  after the rate swap agreements  would be approximately million as of december  a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would result in a million decrease in annual operating income 
impact of inflation substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent such increases could possibly not be passed along to our guests 
in particular  increases in labor  supplies  taxes  and utility expenses could have an impact on our operating results 
the majority of our employees are seasonal and are paid hourly rates which are consistent with federal and state minimum wage laws 
historically  we have been able to pass along cost increases to guests through increases in admission  food  merchandise and other prices  and we believe that we will continue to have the ability to do so over the long term 
we believe that the effects of inflation  if any  on our operating results and financial condition have been and will continue to be minor
