tollgrade designs  engineers  markets and supports test system and status monitoring hardware and software products for the telecommunications and cable industries in the united states and international markets 
the company s telecommunications proprietary test access products enable telecommunications service providers to remotely diagnose problems in digital subscriber lines dsl and plain old telephone service pots lines in public switched telephone network pstn  broadband and internet protocol ip networks 
the company s test system products  primarily the digitest and tel systems including centralized test software and remote measurement hardware  enable local exchange carriers to conduct a full range of measurement and fault diagnosis for efficient dispatch of field staff to maintain and repair pots and or dsl services  along with the ability to pre qualify and provide broadband dsl services offerings 
the company s cable products include the cheetah system  a complete cable status monitoring system that provides a comprehensive testing solution for the broadband hybrid fiber coax hfc distribution system 
the status monitoring system consists of a host server for user interface  control and configuration  a headend controller for managing network communications  and transponders that are strategically located within the cable network to gather status reports from power supplies  line amplifiers and fiber optic nodes 
our products can also be upgraded to support voice over internet protocol voip testing capability to enable 
table of contents voice trouble identification in the hfc network 
since  the company has made four acquisitions allowing us to consolidate our positions in the telecommunications line test and cable status monitoring markets 
these acquisitions included the mlt loopcare product from lucent technologies  inc in  the cheetah product line from acterna  llc in  the line test business from emerson network power energy systems  na in  and the tel  celerity and ldu products from the broadband test division btd from teradyne  inc in through these acquisitions  we significantly expanded our product offerings and our customer base  in particular  our international customer base 
during  the company announced its intention to develop and market products targeted at the electric power utility market 
our lighthouse centralized remote monitoring system provides the means for electric power utilities to continuously monitor the distribution grid in order to detect faults and help minimize the impact of outages while optimizing the utilization of assets 
the lighthouse solution enables monitoring  maintenance and reporting functions in real time 
as of the first quarter of  the first release of the solution offering is now generally available and is also involved in a number of evaluation pilot programs at power utilities

copies of our filings are available free of charge to any shareholder of record upon written request to the secretary  tollgrade communications  inc  nixon road  cheswick  pennsylvania products telecommunications test and measurement products our proprietary telecommunications test and measurement products  which include our system test and mcu products  enable telephone companies to qualify and troubleshoot broadband dsl and ip services and remotely diagnose problems in pots lines 
most dsl lines today provide broadband internet access for residential and business customers  fed from a central or remote office digital subscriber line access multiplexer dslam and configured with either a shared pots voice service or unbundled from the voice switch entirely in the case of a competitive local exchange carriers clecs service offering 
our systems can be used to qualify loops for dsl service as well as ongoing maintenance and repair of these ip lines 
as telecommunications service providers move to all ip networks and services voice  video and data  tollgrade s test systems are positioned to be upgraded to support the testing of these services 
pots lines provide traditional voice service as well as connections for communication devices such as computer modems and fax machines 
pots excludes non switched and private lines  such as data communications service lines  commonly referred to as special services 
an important aspect of efficiently maintaining a telecommunications network is the ability to remotely test  diagnose and locate any service affecting problems within that network 
tollgrade s system test products are made up of a centralized test operating system integrated into the customers repair handling database systems  and remote test hardware located at telephone companies central and remote offices 
these systems enable local exchange carriers to conduct a full range of fault diagnostics in the local loop  the portion of the telephone network that connects end users to the central office 
in addition  line test systems provide the capability to remotely qualify  deploy and maintain services such as dsl and integrated services digital network isdn services which are carried over pots lines 
these test systems reduce the time needed to identify and resolve problems  eliminating or reducing the costs of dispatching a technician to the problem site 
most pots line test systems  however  were designed only for use over copper wire line  as a result  traditional test systems could not access local loops in which fiber optic technology had been introduced 
our mcu product line  which is used primarily by large domestic carriers  solved this problem  extending loopcare testing from the central office to the fiber fed remote digital loop carrier dlc lines by mimicking a digital bypass pair  which is essentially a telephone circuit that connects central test and measurement devices to the copper circuits close to the customer  ie  the last mile 

table of contents we believe our digitest system  which is one of our system test products  is well positioned for the present and future of telecommunication network testing  combining our line test system with a next generation test platform to provide a complete test system solution for pots and dsl local loop prequalification and in service testing 
system test products during  the company determined after a thorough strategic review process to reposition itself with a greater focus on its service assurance offerings 
the company intends to build upon the strength of our system test products  which are at the center of our service assurance offerings  but with a greater emphasis on expanding our service assurance software solutions 
our system test product software offerings include four separate operating support systems oss loopcare  tel  celerity  and ltsc  each having an established installed base 
loopcare is also the primary application for broadband dsl testing and can be architected to overlay tel and ltsc to add this functionality to the existing line test application with the addition of the digitest measurement platform 
we plan to leverage these software incumbencies  and extend testing coverage to next generation network architectures 
the implementation of our strategy initially will expand upon existing customer requests for enhanced features and capabilities 
included in our system test products is our digitest product family 
our digitest product family  which includes the loopcare software and digitest ice  digitest edge and digitest hub hardware  performs physical and logical measurements to verify the connection performance of lines and circuits and reports those measurements to our loopcare oss 
loopcare  in turn  analyzes that measurement data and creates an easy to understand fault description 
at the same time  loopcare can generate a dispatch to a work center so that a repairman can fix the problem 
loopcare and the digitest hardware are also used to pre qualify  verify installation  and remotely isolate troubles for various dsl services  including testing the logical layers to verify modem synchronization in to the dslam or out to the customer 
the digitest product family can also serve as a replacement for aging loop test system lts equipment deployed in current domestic networks 
digitest edge provides a global platform for broadband test applications and pots  by combining a narrowband and wideband metallic testing platform with a multi layered dsl service assurance platform 
these test capabilities  when managed by loopcare  enable service providers to accurately isolate a dsl problem between the customer s premises  the local exchange carrier s local loop and dslam serving network  and the internet service provider s data network 
digitest hub is a central office test platform designed to support multiple testing environments 
the digitest hub addresses emerging broadband testing requirements  but also retains interfaces to legacy equipment  allowing for migration from traditional to packet based delivery of services and allowing service providers to continue automated  mass market processes 
the digitest hub has been deployed extensively by one of the company s large international customers 
the newest addition to the digitest product family is digitest ice  which became generally available in the second quarter of digitest ice  our latest ip service assurance test probe  is squarely aimed at testing triple play voice  video and data services over emerging fiber to the curb or cabinet broadband access networks 
these lower line count remote sites require cost optimized test probes and greater ip test capabilities to fulfill the requirements of triple play testing 
digitest ice provides both metallic and multi layered testing to help service providers install and maintain triple play services 
with digitest ice  the customer will be able to quickly isolate voip  iptv and high speed internet access issues  verify their network performance  and synch with broadband equipment to validate connectivity and throughput 
coupled with our centralized software platforms  digitest ice provides a comprehensive broadband test and dispatch solution 
our system test products also include tel and celerity software products working with ldu hardware test probes 
these products perform similar line test functions and test measurements as our other system test products  but have been optimized for operation in the international markets  and have extensive deployment in europe  covering over million access lines 
the tel and ldu products have also been deployed on a more targeted basis in north america  as well as in international markets outside of europe 
also deployed primarily in europe  the middle east and africa emea geographical areas are the n x test ltsc family of products 
we have original equipment manufacturer oem agreements in place for the supply of a communications card for our digitest edge product and for the supply of an access device for that product line 
both of these agreements contain automatic renewal terms  unless earlier terminated 
we are also a party to a number of third party software license agreements that allow us to incorporate third party software products and features into our loopcare  tel and celerity software 
we have licensing arrangements with aware  inc for certain technology related to our digitest products and pay royalties and license fees for the use of such technology on a fixed per unit basis 
this license agreement with aware renews automatically on an annual basis  unless earlier terminated 
the company also has a license agreement with green hills software  inc for certain 
table of contents technology related to our digitest ice product  which agreement expires years from the effective date of may   unless earlier terminated 
we market and sell our system test products primarily through our direct sales force as well as through certain reseller and distributor agreements 
sales of the digitest product line including related software sales accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
services our services offerings include software maintenance and support for our oss offerings and hardware maintenance for the test probes  as well as our professional services  which are designed to ensure that all of the components of our customers test systems operate properly 
the primary customers for our services offerings are the large domestic carriers and international customers 
we have a number of large service agreements with these customers which cover both software and hardware maintenance for our products 
loss of any one of these service agreement customers could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business as a whole 
including software maintenance and support  services revenue accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
historically  our services business was comprised of the more traditional pots based testability services  and the revenue stream was largely project based and as such  difficult to predict 
during the last few years  and primarily as a result of the acquisition of the btd products and related service agreements  the services business has moved toward more contract based software maintenance services  the revenue from which is more predictable 
because of this increase  our focus on our software applications as part of our refined strategy  and the decline in revenues from our other product lines  we expect services to continue to comprise a larger percentage of our revenue in the future 
mcu our legacy mcu products plug into dlc systems  the large network transmission systems used by telephone companies to link the copper and fiber optic portions of the local loop 
mcu products allow our customers to extend their line testing capabilities to all of their pots lines served by a dlc system regardless of whether the system is fed by a copper or fiber optic link 
dlc systems  which are located at telephone companies central offices and at remote sites within local user areas  effectively multiplex the services of a single fiber optic line into multiple copper lines 
in many instances  several dlc systems are located at a single remote site to create multiple local loops that serve several thousand different end user homes and businesses 
generally  for every dlc remote site  customers will deploy at least two mcu line testing products 
one of three patents for our legacy mcu products will expire during  and we expect that the loss of this patent protection will permit greater competition within this market segment that could cause our revenues from this product line to decline 
we market and sell our mcu products directly to customers as well as through certain oem agreements 
we also have certain royalty based license agreements in place to enable us to maintain capability with specific dlc systems 
we paid royalties under these agreements in the amounts of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales of mcu products and related hardware accounted for approximately  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cable testing products the company s cheetah performance and status monitoring products provide a broad network assurance solution for the broadband hfc distribution system found in the cable television industry 
our cheetah products gather status information and report on critical components within the cable network 
the company s monitoring systems include complete hardware and software solutions that enable efficient hfc plant status monitoring 
by providing a constant  proactive view of the health and status of outside plant transmission systems  the products can reduce operating costs and increase subscriber satisfaction 
our cable offerings consist of cheetahxd broadband assurance software  our proprietary cheetahnet formerly netmentor software systems  maintenance  head end controllers  return path switch hardware  both proprietary and docsis based transponders and other equipment which gather status and performance reports from power supplies  line amplifiers and fiber optic nodes 

table of contents our cheetahip hfc service assurance solution allows cable operators to proactively test and monitor voip using hardware test probes and software analysis tools 
by layering voip test point software on to docsis based transponders  the hfc access network is populated with a tollgrade test probe that is controlled by a software management system  placing active on demand and batch voip test calls point to point across the network for remote fault diagnosis

electric utility monitoring products the company s new product development effort  the lighthouse product line  is being designed to provide power grid monitoring capabilities to electric utilities 
research and investment throughout and enabled the general availability of the first release of the product line during the first quarter of the test system solution currently consists of line mounted sensors  aggregators  and centralized software providing an end to end solution for power providers to efficiently monitor their overhead distribution circuits in real time 
a lighthouse sensor  mounted directly on the electrical conductor  will continuously monitor key circuit parameters and transmit data over a wireless network to a central location  reducing time of detecting a problem on the grid  identifying its location and restoring service 
lighthouse is intended as an innovative means for electric power utilities to deploy technology to provide real time grid intelligence to detect faults and help minimize the impact of outages while optimizing the utilization of assets 
the system is designed to improve the overall efficiency of energy delivery  improve customer satisfaction and improve the financial performance of the electric utilities 
the company had no revenue in from these products  which were not generally available until the first quarter of operating segment we have determined that our business has one operating segment  test assurance 
all product sales relate to the business of testing infrastructure and networks for the telecommunications and cable industries 
our products have similar production processes  and are sold through comparable distribution channels and means to similar types and classes of customers already in  or entering into  the telecommunications and cable businesses 
operating results are regularly reviewed by the company s chief operating decision maker regarding decisions about the allocation of resources and to assess performance 
sales and competition with our headquarters in cheswick  pennsylvania  we market our products and services primarily through our direct sales organization with offices in cheswick  pennsylvania and piscataway  new jersey in the united states and bracknell  united kingdom  antwerp  belgium and wuppertal  germany 
additionally  we have a channel of oems  value added resellers and distributors  both domestic and international 

table of contents revenue concentrations the company s customers range from the largest telecom and cable providers  to numerous independent telecom  cable and broadband providers around the world 
our primary customers for our telco products and services are large domestic and european telecommunications service providers 
the company tracks its telco sales by two large customer groups  the first of which includes qwest  at t and verizon formerly referred to as rbocs and collectively referred to herein as the former rbocs  and the second of which includes certain large international telephone service providers in europe  namely british telecom  royal kpn nv  belgacom nv  deutsche telecom ag t com and telef nica o czech republic  as collectively referred to herein as the european telcos 
sales in   and to at t including the former bellsouth corporation accounted for approximately   and  respectively 
although the large domestic carrier customers currently focus their spending more aggressively in wireless and access technologies  the proportion of revenue from large domestic carriers has remained relatively stable 
during  and  sales to the former rbocs accounted for approximately  and of the company s total revenue  respectively 
sales in and to the european telcos accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s total revenue 
european telco sales were insignificant in deutsche telecom had sales in of approximately of the company s total revenue 
in  one customer had sales of of the company s total revenue 
meanwhile  the proportion of revenues from international sales has increased substantially from to as described below 
sales to one cable oem customer  alpha technologies  inc  comprised of our total revenue in there were no similar cable customer concentrations in or because of our dependency on certain large domestic and international carriers and certain significant cable multiple system operators msos and oems  the potential loss of one or more of these customers  or the reduction of orders for our products by one or more of these customers  could materially and adversely affect our results 
we distinguish revenue by geographic area based upon customer location 
domestic sales represented approximately   and of the company s total revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
international sales represented approximately of the company s total revenue for the year ended december   compared with and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is primarily attributable to sales related to the company s acquisition of btd from teradyne  inc on august  and the deployment of products into saudi arabia  offset  in part  by a decrease in our deployment of products into south africa and certain european accounts 
our international sales are primarily in three geographic areas the americas excluding the united states of america  europe  the middle east and africa emea  and asia pacific 
sales for the americas  excluding the united states of america  were approximately million or of international sales  sales for emea were million or of international sales and sales in asia pacific were million or of international sales for the year ended december  sales for the americas  excluding the united states of america  were approximately million or of international sales  sales for emea were million or of international sales and sales in asia pacific were million or of international sales for the year ended december  sales for the americas  excluding the united states of america  were approximately million or of international sales  sales for emea were million or of international sales and sales in asia pacific were million or of international sales for the year ended december  see the discussion in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this form k for a further description of our international sales strategies 
competitive conditions the market for telecommunications and cable testing equipment is highly competitive 
primary competitive factors in the company s market include price  product features  performance  reliability  service and support  breadth of product line  technical documentation  prompt delivery and the availability of alternative technologies 
the competitors for our traditional pots telecommunications and our broadband technologies and applications solution offerings include jds uniphase  exfo electro optical engineering inc  spirent communications plc  huawei technologies co  ltd  fluke corporation formerly harris corporation  and nortel 
historically  we have positioned ourselves against competitors offerings by leveraging our patented technologies  partnering with network equipment providers  and investing in next generation research and development 
we also leverage our existing customer incumbencies and core competencies to test broadband next generation networks to position ourselves against our competitors on the basis of lower deployment costs and long term operational cost efficiencies 
we also face competition as a growing number of next generation network equipment providers offer testing technology in the form of a chipset embedded into their products 
where testing was once only available in the form of multi chip  circuit board based designs like those found in our remote test system products  integrated testing technology is now available in low cost chipsets embedded into the products of these network equipment providers 
referred to as selt delt single ended line test or double ended line test  the testing technology available in this form has limited functionality and only provides partial views of faults in the network 
as such  we continue to believe that more robust testing technology like that offered in our products should be important for 
table of contents network assurance as the next generation network evolves and increased penetration of triple play services occurs 
however  we have faced and will continue to face competition and downward pricing pressure as a result of the availability of these less expensive  less robust alternatives resulting in decreased sales of our system products to certain of our customers 
another area of competition is from software solution providers and the internal information technology it departments of our own carrier customers 
in the past  we offered solutions consisting of hardware probes  coupled with a centralized software platform that analyzed the data pulled from the probes and determined the appropriate dispatch statement or issue identification statement 
as the capabilities of new infrastructure equipment increases  test and monitoring software platforms are increasingly taking advantage of the available data from the infrastructure equipment 
the new software platforms offer customers a lower upfront cost  but offer less robust capabilities as compared to solutions built with hardware and software combinations 
at the same time  many of our larger customers have captive development capabilities in their own it organizations 
these it teams can develop software systems that compete with our offerings 
because of our intimate knowledge of many carrier customers  we believe we have a strategic advantage over these internal groups based on our industry knowledge and the efficiency of our development resources in comparison to internal customer resources 
with respect to our cable products  status and performance monitoring competitors include am communications  inc  cisco systems inc formerly scientific atlanta  inc  alpha technologies  inc 
and electroline equipment inc through the adoption of open  non proprietary standards for status performance monitoring systems  such as hybrid management sub layer hms and docsis  this market has become highly competitive 
pricing pressures have increased as all providers of monitoring transponders and associated software have reduced price points to meet customer demands 
during  alpha technologies introduced a docsis based transponder which competes with the products we supply to the cable market both directly and through our supply agreement with alpha 
as with the telecommunications products  the extension of our cable products to address internet protocol test applications expands our list of traditional competitors to now include empirix inc  jds uniphase  tektronix canada inc  exfo formerly brix networks  inc 
and agilent technologies inc manufacturing our manufacturing operations consist primarily of quality control  functional testing  final assembly  burn in and shipping 
we are iso registered with the british standards institution  inc iso is a harmonized set of standards that define quality assurance management 
written by the international organization for standardization iso  iso is recognized throughout the united states  canada  the european union and japan 
to be registered  the company develops and maintains internal documentation and processes to support the production of quality products to ensure customer satisfaction 
for our telephony products  we utilize two contract manufacturers to perform a majority of the circuit board assembly and in circuit testing work for our telecommunications products 
for our cheetah hardware  we also use two different contract manufacturers to assemble and test the products 
in the first half of  we transitioned our cheetah hardware supply relationship from one vendor to the two contract manufacturers mentioned 
we split the production between two facilities to leverage high volume production in a non us contract manufacturer and lower volume products with a domestic partner 
the loss of any of these contract manufacturers or inability of such firms to meet our manufacturing needs could cause delays in our ability to meet our customers orders and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  shortages of raw materials delivered to  or production capacity constraints at  the company s contract manufacturers could negatively affect our ability to meet our production obligations and result in increased prices for affected parts 
any such reduction may result in delays in shipments of the company s products or increases in the price of components  either of which could have a material adverse impact on us 
generally  our products use industry standard components  however  application specific integrated circuits asics are also a key component of some of our products and are custom made to the company s specifications 
although we have generally been able to obtain asics on a timely basis  a delay in the delivery of these components could have a material adverse impact on the company 
product and technology development our product development personnel are organized into teams dedicated to one or more specific product lines or technologies 
we continuously monitor developing technologies in order to introduce new or improved products as defined standards and markets emerge 
in  we continued to investigate the development of new applications for our telecommunications and cable technologies  as well as to develop enhancements and new features to our software product platforms 
the company also undertook 
table of contents research and development pursuant to oem agreements for docsis based fiber node transponders 
we also expanded our research activities related to our telecom software product offerings and began development on a software platform based on our refocused strategy 
beginning in and continuing through  we developed technology for use in power grid monitoring for use by electric utility companies 
our solution offering for electric utility became generally available in the first quarter of for the years ended december   and  research and development expenses were approximately million  million and million  respectively

backlog the company s order backlog for firm customer purchase orders and signed software maintenance contracts was million at december   compared to backlog of million at december  the backlog at december  and december  included approximately million and million  respectively  related to software maintenance contracts  including acquired btd maintenance agreements reflected in the and backlog  which is primarily earned and recognized as income on a straight line basis during the remaining terms of these agreements 
we expect the revenues related to the entire backlog at december  to be recognized in we currently have software maintenance agreements with the four largest domestic telecommunications carriers 
one of those agreements expires on december  and another extends through the remaining two agreements expired on december  of those two agreements  one was extended through march  and further negotiations continue with that customer 
the final agreement was extended for an additional three years on february  and will expire at the end of we also have a number of agreements in place with european and international telecommunications customers  including our three largest customers in europe 
two of the three contracts with our largest european customers expire on june  and one expired on december  we are still in negotiations with the european customer whose contract expired at the end of  and we are attempting to complete that agreement during the first quarter of we also have several software maintenance arrangements in place covering our cable software products 
we have adopted a policy to include a maximum of twelve months revenue from multi year software maintenance agreements in reported backlog 
software maintenance revenue is deemed to be earned and recognized as income on a straight line basis over the terms of the underlying agreements 
periodic fluctuations in customer orders and backlog result from a variety of factors  including but not limited to the timing of significant orders and shipments 
although these fluctuations could impact short term results  they are not necessarily indicative of long term trends in sales of our products 

table of contents employees as of december   we had full time employees  of whom were located in the united states and of whom were located in europe 
in the first quarter of  tollgrade began to implement initiatives as part of a strategic plan aimed at increasing efficiency and reducing cost  which is discussed in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as part of this initiative  the company eliminated approximately positions and an additional positions were reassigned to new projects

table of contents item a 
risk factors we wish to caution each reader of this form k to consider the following factors and other factors discussed herein and in other past reports  including but not limited to prior year form k and quarterly form q reports filed with the sec 
our business and results of operations could be materially affected by any of the following risks 
the factors discussed herein are not exhaustive 
therefore  the factors contained herein should be read together with other reports and documents that we file with the sec from time to time  which may supplement  modify  supersede or update the factors listed in this document 
our services business is subject to a trend of reduced capital spending for our products by our major customers and possible delays in  or the inability to complete  negotiation and execution of purchase and service agreements with new or existing customers could significantly impact business results and possibly result in impairment charges in the future 
our services business  which includes software maintenance as well as professional services  is sensitive to the decline in our large carrier customers capital investment in their traditional voice services  which tends to drive the professional services 
furthermore  the timing of the extension or renewal of certain of the more significant software maintenance agreements can have a materially adverse impact on the company s services revenues for any particular fiscal quarter or year 
we are also experiencing intense pricing pressure from many of our larger software maintenance customers  as they continue to attempt to reduce their own internal costs to substantiate the value of our long term service contracts 
for example  the three major customer contracts that expired on december  have resulted in extended negotiations that have forced the company to demonstrate to these customers the value provided by our products and services 
one of these contracts has been extended for a three year term  but the other two are still being negotiated 
we believe that our services and our software systems provide significant value to our customers  however  each time a contract is scheduled for renewal  we must show our customers the value of the entire system and the costs saved by maintaining and even extending the system capabilities 
to date  we have been able to renegotiate most of the major contracts other than those that we have described as ongoing and substantially maintain existing pricing and terms through these efforts  however  if we are not successful in the future  such failure would potentially have significant adverse effects on our business 
accordingly  our ability to maintain historical levels from traditional sources or increase levels of services revenues cannot be assured  and in fact  such levels may decrease 
also  if the negotiations for the two major customer contracts that expired on december  are not successful  the agreements may not be renewed at all or may be renewed on terms that are not as favorable to the company as the current arrangements 
in either event  the revenue and profitability of our services offerings could be materially adversely affected  which could result in an impairment charge to the corresponding intangible assets on our balance sheet in future periods 
our future growth depends to a large extent upon our ability to reposition the company with a greater focus on our service assurance testing offerings to the telecom market 
as a result of the strategic review of our business in  we determined that the company should reposition itself with a greater focus on its service assurance offerings to the telecom market  and our software testing solutions in particular 
specifically  our goal is to develop an integrated software platform to serve multiple applications and products specifically for the telecommunications industry in the ip service assurance market which we believe will grow rapidly in the foreseeable future 
to implement our strategy and exploit this opportunity  we will need to create new software products and enter into strategic partnerships so that we can maximize the potential of our incumbent position with customers and our long term relationships 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to reposition the company in the manner described above or that  if we are successful  the repositioning will result in the benefits and opportunities that we expect 
the development of new software solutions is an uncertain and potentially expensive process and requires that we accurately anticipate technological and market trends so that we can deliver products in a timely manner 
we may not be successful in completing the development of the new platform or  if we do so  we may not be able to commercialize the product in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance 
in addition  although software products generally generate higher margin returns for us than our hardware products  the initial development costs of software applications  coupled with the inherent problems with pricing software  can make it difficult to assess the potential profitability of new software products 
in addition  because it is customary in our industry to sell perpetual enterprise licenses that cover a customer s entire operations  it can be difficult to assess at the time of sale the appropriate price that we should charge for a particular license 
if we fail to set appropriate prices for our software licenses  our profitability could be adversely affected 
in addition  the potential market growth rate may not be as significant as we expect or could develop in unforeseen directions 
for example  the commercial availability of competing products may affect the extent or timing of market acceptance of our solutions 
furthermore  we may not be successful in forming the strategic alliances contemplated by our new strategy 
we may not identify the right partners or our partners could fail to perform their obligations and the partnership may fail to develop as expected 
as a result of these and other factors  we may not be able to implement our strategy and our ability to exploit our incumbent position in the manner 
table of contents contemplated by our strategic repositioning would be materially and adversely affected 
our cost reduction plans may be ineffective or may limit our ability to compete 
during  we implemented a series of initiatives designed to increase efficiency and reduce costs and to focus our core business on our test and measurement expertise 
these initiatives included reductions of staff  alignment of investments and a completion of the integration plans from recent acquisitions  including emerson and broadband test division 
although we have experienced some cost savings from these initiatives and we believe that these actions will continue to reduce costs  they may not be sufficient to achieve the required operational efficiencies that will enable us to respond more quickly to changes in the market or result in the improvements in our business that we anticipate or be sufficient to offset a decline in our revenue 
in such event  we may be forced to take additional cost reducing initiatives  which may negatively impact quarterly earnings and profitability as we account for severance and other related costs 
in addition  there is the risk that such measures could have long term effects on our business by reducing our pool of talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in our products  making it more difficult for us to respond to customers  limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel 
these circumstances could cause our earnings to be lower than they otherwise might be 
a continuing downturn in the global economy may adversely affect our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
demand for our products and services is increasingly dependent upon the rate of growth in the global economy 
if current economic conditions continue  customer demand for our products and services could be even more adversely affected than experienced to date  which in turn could adversely affect our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
many factors could continue to adversely affect regional or global economic growth 
some of these factors include poor availability of credit  continued recession in the united states economy and other countries that we serve  erosion in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies in jurisdictions where we transact business  significant act of terrorism which disrupts global trade or consumer confidence  geopolitical tensions including war and civil unrest  and reduced levels of economic activity or disruption of domestic or international transportation 
the recent challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased or otherwise constrict our customers spending on our products and services 
as a result  revenues may decline and reserves for doubtful accounts and write offs of accounts receivable may increase 
in addition  certain of our contracts are paid or make payments in foreign currencies  and continued decrease in the exchange rate of the us dollar relative to these currencies could further reduce our revenues  and such impact could be material 
we maintain an investment portfolio  consisting of cash  cash equivalents and investments in individual municipal bonds  and corporate and government bonds 
these investments are subject to general credit  liquidity  market  and interest rate risks 
if the global credit market continues to deteriorate  our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments have experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value  requiring an impairment charge which could adversely impact our financial results 
we are dependent upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate our key personnel 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate our key management personnel  including the company s ceo  cfo  senior management team members  and key engineers  necessary to implement our business plan and to grow our business 
despite the adverse economic conditions of the past several years  competition for certain specific technical and management skill sets is intense 
if we are unable to identify and hire the personnel that we need to succeed  or if one or more of our present key employees were to cease to be associated with the company  our future results could be adversely affected 
furthermore  since we have experienced a number of changes in our senior management positions  both as part of the restructuring initiatives and otherwise  including a new ceo during and a new cfo during although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to address the impact of these changes  there is the risk that such changes could impact our business  which could negatively affect operating results 
we depend upon a few major customers for a majority of our revenues  and the loss of any of these customers  or the substantial reduction in the products or services that they purchase from us  would significantly reduce our revenues and net income 
we currently depend upon a few major customers for a significant portion of our revenues and we expect to continue to derive a 
table of contents significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers in the future 
the loss of any of these customers or a substantial reduction in the products or services that they purchase from us or our inability to renew services agreements with customers and to do so upon terms at least as favorable to the company as current agreements would significantly reduce our revenues and net income 
furthermore  diversions in the capital spending of certain of these customers to new network elements have and could continue to lead to their reduced demand for our products  which could in turn have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operation 
the capital spending of our large domestic carrier customers  as well as many of our other customers and potential customers  are dictated by a number of factors  most of which are beyond our control  including the conditions of the communications market and the weakening economy in general  subscriber line loss and related reduced demand for wireline telecommunications services  changes or shifts in the technology utilized in the networks  labor disputes between our customers and their collective bargaining units  the failure of our customers to meet established purchase forecasts and growth projections  competition among the large domestic carriers  competitive exchange carriers and wireless telecommunications and cable providers  and reorganizations  including management changes  at one or more of our customers or potential customers 
if the financial condition of one or more of our major customers should deteriorate  or if they have difficulty acquiring investment capital or reduce their capital expenditures due to any of these or other factors  a substantial decrease in our revenues would likely result 
our operating results may vary from quarter to quarter  causing our stock price to fluctuate 
our operating results have in the past been subject to quarter to quarter fluctuations  and we expect that these fluctuations will continue  and may increase in magnitude  in future periods 
demand for our products is driven by many factors  including the availability of funding for our products in customers capital budgets 
some of our customers place large orders near the end of a quarter or fiscal year  in part to spend remaining available capital budget funds 
seasonal fluctuations in customer demand for our products driven by budgetary and other reasons can create corresponding fluctuations in period to period revenues  and we therefore cannot assure you that our results in one period are necessarily indicative of our revenues in any future period 
in addition  the number and timing of large individual sales and the ability to obtain acceptances of those sales  where applicable  has been difficult for us to predict  and large individual sales have  in some cases  occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated  or have not occurred at all 
the loss or deferral of one or more significant sales in a quarter could harm our operating results 
it is possible that in some quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of investors 
in such events  or in the event adverse conditions prevail  the market price of our common stock may decline significantly 
we may experience reduced product sales caused by customers transitioning their access network service assurance solutions 
certain of our larger customers are in the process of upgrading their access networks  and continue transitioning and upgrading their service assurance solutions for these networks 
this has and may continue to adversely impact revenues from our testing products 
further  these customers may decide not to adopt our technologies for their service assurance needs  which would have a significant adverse affect on revenues for those products 
we have completed  and may pursue additional acquisitions  which could result in the disruption of our current business  difficulties related to the integration of acquired businesses  and substantial expenditures 
we have completed  and we may pursue additional acquisitions of companies  product lines and technologies as part of our strategic efforts to realign our resources around growth opportunities in current  adjacent and new markets  to enhance our existing products  to introduce new products and to fulfill changing customer requirements 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the disruption of our business  exposure to assumed or unknown liabilities of the acquired target  and the failure to integrate successfully the operations and products of acquired businesses 
international acquisitions provide specific challenges due to the unique topology of international telecommunications networks  as well as requirements of doing business in particular countries 
further  our ability to sell certain products internationally depends upon our ability to maintain certain key manufacturing relationships and we may not be able to continue those relationships 
goodwill arising from acquisitions may result in significant impairment charges against our operating results in one or more future periods 
furthermore  we may never achieve the anticipated results or benefits of an acquisition  such as increased market share or the successful development and sales of a new product 
the effects of any of these risks could materially harm our business and reduce our future results of operations 

table of contents the failure of acquired assets to meet expectations  or a decline in our fair value determined by market prices of our stock  could indicate impairment of our intangible assets and result in impairment charges 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and requires that these assets be measured for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
during and  based on our assessment that triggering events had occurred  we performed the required recoverability tests of sfas and determined that certain long lived assets were impaired 
the occurrence of further triggering events could result in additional impairments 
the sale of our products is dependent upon our ability to satisfy the proprietary requirements of our customers 
we depend upon a relatively narrow range of products for the majority of our revenue 
our success in marketing our products is dependent upon their continued acceptance by our customers 
in some cases  our customers require that our products meet their own proprietary requirements 
if we are unable to satisfy such requirements  or forecast and adapt to changes in such requirements  our business could be materially harmed 
in addition  we introduced new products during  including the digitest ice and the first version of the lighthouse products 
the rate of acceptance of these new products could be delayed by  or fail to achieve  among other factors  extended testing or acceptance periods or requests for custom or modified engineering of such products to conform to customer requirements 
the sale of our products is dependent on our ability to respond to rapid technological change  including evolving industry wide standards  and may be adversely affected by the development  and acceptance by our customers  of new technologies which may compete with or reduce the demand for our products 
rapid technological change  including evolving industry standards  could render our products obsolete 
sales of our legacy cable products are declining  and demand for these products may further decline or be eliminated  as the market for these products transitions to industry wide standards  such as the hms and docsis cable standards 
furthermore  standards for new services and technologies continue to evolve  requiring us to continually modify our products or to develop new versions to meet these new standards 
certain of these certifications are limited in scope  which may require that the product be recertified if any modifications to hardware or firmware are made 
if we are unable to forecast the demand for our products  develop new products or adapt our existing products to meet these evolving standards and other technological innovations  or if our products and services do not gain the acceptance of our customers  our overall revenues and profitability will be adversely affected 
in addition  changes in network architecture experienced by our customers in the telephony market have and may continue to negatively affect our ability to sell products in these markets 
although we are addressing these changes with modifications to our existing products  if customers do not accept this new product technology  our revenues could be adversely affected 
further  we are experiencing competition from the internal information technology it departments of our own carrier customers 
in the past  we offered solutions consisting of hardware probes  coupled with a centralized software platform that analyzed the data pulled from the probes and determined the appropriate dispatch statement or issue identification statement 
as the capabilities of new infrastructure equipment increases  test and monitoring software platforms are increasingly taking advantage of the available data from the infrastructure equipment 
at the same time  many of our larger customers have captive development capabilities in their own it organizations 
these it teams can develop competing software systems to our offerings  which could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to those customers  which could negatively impact overall revenues from such products 
furthermore  the development of new technologies which compete with or reduce the demand for our products  and the adoption of such technologies by our customers  could adversely affect sales of our products 
for example  as our products generally serve the wireline marketplace  to the extent wireline customers migrate to wireless technologies  there may be reduced demand for our products 
in addition  we face new competition as testing functions that were once only available with purpose built test systems are now available as integrated components of network elements 
to the extent our customers adopt such new technology in place of our telecommunications products  the sales of our telecommunications products may be adversely affected 
such competition may also increase pricing pressure for our telecommunications products and adversely affect the revenues from such products 
our reliance on third parties to manufacture certain aspects of our products involves risks  including delays in product shipments and reduced control over product quality 
we depend upon a limited number of third party contract manufacturers to manufacture certain elements of our products  and transitioned to two new contract manufacturers for our cable products in furthermore  the components of our hardware products are procured from a limited number of outside suppliers 
although our products generally use industry standard products  some parts  such as asics  are custom made to our specifications 
our reliance upon such third party contractors involve several risks  including reduced control over manufacturing costs  delivery times  reliability and quality of components 
if we were to encounter a shortage of key manufacturing components from limited sources of supply  or experience manufacturing delays caused by reduced manufacturing 
table of contents capacity  inability of our contract manufacturers to procure raw materials  the loss of key assembly subcontractors  difficulties associated with the transition to our new contract manufacturers or other factors  we could experience lost revenues  increased costs  delays in  cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments  any of which would materially harm our business 
our future sales in international markets are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
as a result of our acquisition of btd and domestic market conditions  our business is becoming more dependent upon international markets 
our future sales in international markets are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including local economic and labor conditions  political instability including terrorism and other acts of war or hostility  unexpected changes in the regulatory environment  trade protection measures  tax laws  our ability to market current or develop new products suitable for international markets  difficulties with deployments and acceptances of products  obtaining and maintaining successful distribution and resale channels  changes in tariffs and foreign currency exchange rates  and longer payment cycles 
these specific risks  or an overall reduction in the demand for or the sales of our products in international markets  could adversely affect future results 
we face intense competition  which could result in our losing market share or experiencing a decline in our gross margins 
the markets for some of our products are very competitive 
some of our competitors have greater technological  financial  manufacturing  sales and marketing  and personnel resources than we have 
as a result  these competitors may have an advantage in responding more rapidly or effectively to changes in industry standards or technologies 
competition is particularly intense in the cable markets  due to the introduction of the docsis standard  which allows customers to purchase system components from multiple vendors 
we are also facing competition with our ip based testing solutions  and many competitive technologies  encompassing both hardware and software  are available in these markets 
moreover  better financed competitors may be better able to withstand the pricing pressures that increased competition may bring 
if our introduction of improved products or services is not timely or well received  or if our competitors reduce their prices for products that are comparable to ours  demand for our products and services could be adversely affected 
recent competition from certain network element providers offering chip based testing functionality may also intensify the pricing pressure for our telecommunications products and adversely affect future revenues from such products 
we also face increasing pressure from certain of our large domestic carrier customers on software maintenance agreements  as they continue to divert spending from legacy networks to next generation network elements 
we may also compete directly with our customers 
generally  we sell our products either directly or indirectly through oem channels and other means to end user telecommunications and cable television providers 
it is possible that our customers  as the result of bankruptcy or other rationales for dismantling network equipment  could attempt to resell our products 
the successful development of such a secondary market for our products by a third party could negatively affect demand for our products  reducing our future revenues 
our future results are dependent on our ability to establish  maintain and expand our distribution channels and our existing third party distributors 
we market and sell certain of our products  including our digitest and cheetah product lines and certain of the acquired broadband test division products  through domestic and international oem relationships 
our future results are dependent on our ability to establish  maintain and expand third party relationships with oem as well as other marketing and sales distribution channels 
if  however  the third parties with whom we have entered into such oem and other arrangements should fail to meet their contractual obligations  cease doing  or reduce the amount of their business with us or otherwise fail to meet their own performance objectives  customer demand for our products could be adversely affected  which would have an adverse effect on our revenues 
the sales cycle for our system products is long  and the delay or failure to complete one or more large transactions in a quarter could cause our operating results to fall below our expectations 
the sales cycle for our system products is highly customer specific and can vary from a few weeks to many months 
the system requirements of customers is highly dependent on many factors  including but not limited to their projections of business growth  capital budgets and anticipated cost savings from implementation of the system 
our delay or failure to complete one or more large transactions in a quarter could harm our operating results 
our systems involve significant capital commitments by customers 
potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available enterprise software and system testing solutions and require us to expend substantial time  effort and money educating them about the value of our solutions 
system sales often require an extensive sales effort throughout a customer s organization because decisions to acquire software licenses and associated system hardware involve the evaluation of the products by a significant number of customer personnel in various functional and geographic areas  each often having specific and conflicting requirements 
a variety of factors  including actions by competitors and other factors over which we have little or no control  may cause potential customers to favor a particular supplier or to delay or forego a purchase 

table of contents many of the company s products must comply with significant governmental and industry based regulations  certifications  standards and protocols  some of which evolve as new technologies are deployed 
compliance with such regulations  certifications  standards and protocols may prove costly and time consuming for the company  and the company cannot provide assurance that its products will continue to meet these standards in the future 
in addition  regulatory compliance may present barriers to entry in particular markets or reduce the profitability of the company s product offerings 
such regulations  certifications  standards and protocols may also adversely affect the industries in which we compete  limit the number of potential customers for the company s products and services or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to comply  or delays in compliance  with such regulations  standards and protocols or delays in receipt of such certifications could delay the introduction of new products or cause the company s existing products to become obsolete 
we depend on sales of our mcu products for a meaningful portion of our revenues  but this product is mature and its sales will continue to decline 
a large portion of our sales have historically been attributable to our mcu products 
we expect that our mcu products may continue to account for a meaningful percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
however  these sales are declining and our three patents for our mcu products will expire between and mcu sales largely depend upon the rate of deployment of new  and the retrofitting of existing  dlc systems in the united states 
installation and replacement of dlc systems are  in turn  driven by a number of factors  including the availability of capital resources and the demand for new or better pots 
our customers have begun to implement next generation network improvements such as fiber to the premises fttp  which do not require the use of our mcu products as does the present hybrid pots network 
if our major customers fail to continue to build out their dsl networks and other projects requiring dlc deployments  or if we otherwise satisfy the domestic telecommunications market s demand for mcus  our mcu sales will continue to decline and our future results would be materially and adversely affected 
although we are unable to predict future prices for our mcu products  we expect that prices for these products will continue to be subject to significant downward pressure in certain markets for the reasons described above 
accordingly  our ability to maintain or increase revenues will be dependent on our ability to expand our customer base  increase unit sales volumes of these products and to successfully  develop  introduce and sell new products such as our cable and software products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to expand our customer base  increase unit sales volumes of existing products or develop  introduce and or sell new products 
further  the loss of patent protection for these products might allow competition within this market segment  which  if successful  could cause our revenues from this product line to be materially adversely affected 
the continued adoption of industry wide standards in both the telecommunications and cable markets could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
we are actively engaged in research to improve and expand our product offerings  including research and development to reduce product costs while providing enhancements  however  with the rise of industry wide standards  among other factors  a number of our products have faced increased pricing pressure  driving lower margins 
if sales of our network assurance and testing solutions and cable status monitoring products do not increase  decrease rapidly  or are not accepted in the marketplace  or if our research and development activities do not produce marketable products that are both competitive and accepted by our customers  our overall revenues and profitability will be adversely affected 
during  we experienced significant declines in sales of a number of our products 
although we are in the process of developing new product offerings to counter this trend  we do not expect to see an immediate recovery across our business  at least in the near future 
the presence of available open source software could adversely affect our ability to maximize revenue from software products 
an emerging risk to our software development efforts is the presence of available open source software  which can allow our competitors and or our customers to piece together a non proprietary software solution relatively quickly 
to the extent they are successful in developing software that meets their feature and benefit needs  revenue from our proprietary software could be adversely affected 
further  to the extent we incorporate open source into our software products  our ability to maximize revenue from our software products could be adversely impacted 
if our development efforts with respect to our lighthouse system fail to result in products which meet our customers needs  or if our customers fail to accept our new products  our revenues will be adversely affected 
we have recently introduced the first version of our lighthouse centralized remote monitoring system for the electric utility industry 
the successful development  introduction and commercial success of this new technology will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to meet customer requirements  the existence of competitive products in the market  our timely and efficient completion of product design and implementation of manufacturing and manufacturing processes  our ability to meet product cost 
table of contents targets generating acceptable margins  timely remediation of product performance issues  if any  identified during testing  product performance at customer locations  differentiation of our product from our competitors products  and management of customer expectations concerning product capabilities and life cycles 
our customers are subject to an evolving governmental regulatory environment that could significantly reduce the demand for our products or increase our costs of doing business 
our customers have historically been subject to a number of governmental regulations  many of which have been repealed or amended as a result of the passage of the telecommunications act of deregulatory efforts have affected and likely will continue to affect our customers in several ways  including the introduction of competitive forces into the local telephone markets and the imposition or removal of controls on the pricing of services 
these and other regulatory changes may limit the scope of our customers deployments of future services and budgets for capital expenditures  which could significantly reduce the demand for our products 
moreover  as the fcc adopts new and amends existing regulations  and as the courts analyze the fcc s authority to do so  our customers cannot accurately predict the rules which will regulate their conduct in their respective markets 
changes in the telecommunications regulatory environment could  among other results  increase our costs of doing business  require our customers to share assets with competitors or prevent the company or our customers from engaging in business activities they may wish to conduct  which could adversely affect our future results 
our limited ability to protect our proprietary information and technology may adversely affect our ability to compete  and our products could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  resulting in claims against us the results of which could be costly 
many of our products consist entirely or partly of proprietary technology owned by us 
although we seek to protect our technology through a combination of copyrights  trade secret laws  contractual obligations and patents  these protections may not be sufficient to prevent the wrongful appropriation of our intellectual property  nor will they prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our proprietary technology 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
in order to defend our proprietary rights in the technology utilized in our products from third party infringement  we may be required to institute legal proceedings 
if we are unable to successfully assert and defend our proprietary rights in the technology utilized in our products  our future results could be adversely affected 
although we attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties in our product development efforts  we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims for alleged infringement from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
any claims relating to the infringement of third party proprietary rights  even if not meritorious  could result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  require us to reengineer or cease sales of our products or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous to us 
in addition  parties making claims may be able to obtain an injunction  which could prevent us from selling our products in the united states or abroad 
the success of some of our products is dependent on our ability to maintain licenses to technology from the manufacturers of systems with which our products must be compatible 
some of our products require that we license technology from manufacturers of systems with which our products must be compatible 
the success of our proprietary mcu products  in particular  rely upon our ability to acquire and maintain licensing arrangements with the various manufacturers of dlc systems for the proprietary design integrated circuits pdics unique to each 
although most of our pdic licensing agreements have perpetual renewal terms  all of them can be terminated by either party 
if we are unable to obtain the pdics necessary for our mcu products to be compatible with a particular dlc system  we may be unable to satisfy the needs of our customers 
furthermore  future pdic license agreements may contain terms comparable to  or materially different than  the terms of existing agreements  as dictated by competitive or other conditions 
the loss of these pdic license agreements  or our inability to maintain an adequate supply of pdics on acceptable terms  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we are unable to satisfy our customers specific product quality  certification or network requirements  our business could be disrupted and our financial condition could be harmed 
our customers demand that our products meet stringent quality  performance and reliability standards 
we have  from time to time  experienced problems in satisfying such standards 
defects or failures have in the past  and may in the future occur relating to our product quality  performance and reliability 
from time to time  our customers also require us to implement specific changes to our products to allow these products to operate within their specific network configurations 
if we are unable to remedy these failures or defects or if we cannot affect such required product modifications  we could experience lost revenues  increased costs  including inventory write offs  warranty expense and costs associated with customer support  delays in or cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts  any of which would harm our business 

table of contents if our accounting controls and procedures are circumvented or otherwise fail to achieve their intended purposes  our business could be seriously harmed 
we evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of each fiscal quarter  and are annually reviewing and evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting in order to comply with sec rules relating to internal control over financial reporting adopted pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
if we ship products that contain defects  the market acceptance of our products and our reputation will be harmed and our customers could seek to recover their damages from us 
our products are complex  and despite extensive testing  may contain defects or undetected errors or failures that may become apparent only after our products have been shipped to our customers and installed in their network or after product features or new versions are released 
any such defect  error or failure could result in failure of market acceptance of our products or damage to our reputation or relations with our customers  resulting in substantial costs for both the company and our customers as well as the cancellation of orders  warranty costs and product returns 
in addition  any defects  errors  misuse of our products or other potential problems within or out of our control that may arise from the use of our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers 
our customers could seek to have us pay for these losses 
although we maintain product liability insurance  it may not be adequate 
we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 
failure to comply with environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business could result in penalties and damage to our reputation 
in effect in the european union are the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the rohs directive and the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the weee directive 
both the rohs directive and the weee directive impact the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported  sold and handled in the european union 
other jurisdictions  such as china  have followed the european union s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal 
although we have concluded that our test and measurement products fall outside the scope of the rohs directive  we have voluntarily undertaken to cause our next generation products to comply with its requirements 
ensuring compliance with the rohs directive  the weee directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions  and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus  could have a negative impact on our business  operations and financial condition 
in addition  based on our conclusion that our test and measurement products do not fall within the scope of these directives  we have determined not to take these compliance measures with respect to certain of our older  legacy products 
should our conclusions with respect to the applicability of the rohs directive to these products be challenged and fail to prevail  we may be subject to monetary and non monetary penalties  and could suffer harm to our reputation 
consolidations in  or a continued slowdown in  the telecommunications industry could harm our business 
we have derived a substantial amount of our revenues from sales of products and related services to the telecommunications industry 
trends indicate that capital spending in the telecommunications industry has decreased and may continue to decrease in the future as a result of a general decline in economic growth in local and international markets 
in particular  large carrier customers have been adversely affected by subscriber line losses as well as by competition from cable and wireless carriers and other carriers entering the local telephone service market 
certain emerging carriers also continue to be hampered by financial instability caused in large part by a lack of access to capital 
in the event of further significant slowdown in capital spending of the telecommunications industry  our business would be adversely affected 
furthermore  as a result of industry consolidation  there may be fewer potential customers requiring our software in the future 
larger  consolidated telecommunications companies may also use their purchasing power to create pressure on the prices and the margins we could realize 
we cannot be certain that consolidations in  or a slowdown in the growth of  the telecommunication industry will not harm our business 
our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  and we may be unable to adjust spending to compensate for unexpected revenue shortfalls 
we base our expense levels in part on forecasts of future orders and sales  which are extremely difficult to predict 
a substantial portion of our operating expenses is related to personnel  facilities and sales and marketing 
the level of spending for such expenses cannot be adjusted quickly and is  therefore  relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  our operating results will be harmed if revenues fall below our expectations in a particular quarter 

table of contents we rely on software that we license from third party developers to perform key functions in our products 
we rely on software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
we could lose the right to use this software or it could be made available to us only on commercially unreasonable terms 
although we believe that  in most cases  alternative software is available from other third party suppliers or internal developments  the loss of or inability to maintain any of these software licenses or the inability of the third parties to enhance in a timely and cost effective manner their products in response to changing customer needs  industry standards or technological developments could delay or reduce our product shipments until equivalent software could be developed internally or identified  licensed and integrated  which would harm our business 
we are affected by a pattern of product price decline in certain markets  which can harm our business 
because our cable products generate lower margins for us than our proprietary telephony offerings  an increase in the percentage of our sales of cable related products relative to our traditional products will result in lower profit margins 
furthermore  consolidations within the cable industry and the adoption of the docsis standards have caused and could continue to cause pricing pressure as our competitors lower product pricing 
as a result of these factors  our revenues have been and are likely to continue to be adversely affected 
although we have developed docsis based hardware and we believe that our relationships with our oem partners position us to succeed in the marketing of docsis based products  these products will likely generate lower margins than have historically been generated by our proprietary technology 
as a result  as our business shifts from our higher margin proprietary products to lower margin cable offerings and standardized products for which there is greater competition  we will need to sell greater volumes of our products to maintain our profitability 
our common stock price may be extremely volatile 
our common stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the market price may vary in response to many factors  some of which are outside our control  including general market and economic conditions  changes in the telecommunications industry  actual or anticipated variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or new services by us or by our competitors or customers  the fact that we no longer receive research coverage by sell side market analysts  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  capital commitments or other strategic announcements  announcements by our customers regarding end market conditions and the status of existing and future infrastructure network deployments  additions or departures of key personnel  and future equity or debt offerings or our announcements of these offerings 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq global select market and the securities of technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies 
these broad market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future materially and adversely affect our stock price  regardless of our operating results 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such company 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources that could harm our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation 
we may be subject from time to time to legal proceedings  and any adverse determinations in these proceedings could materially harm our business 
we may from time to time be involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings  which arise in the ordinary course of business 
litigation matters are inherently unpredictable  and we cannot predict the outcome of any such matters 
if we ultimately lose or settle a case  we may be liable for monetary damages and other costs of litigation 
even if we are entirely successful in a lawsuit  we may incur significant legal expenses and our management may expend significant time in the defense 
an adverse resolution of a lawsuit or legal proceeding could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents we may have difficulty securing new financing upon the same or substantially similar terms 
the company is party with a bank to a three year million unsecured revolving credit facility the facility  which includes a million letter of credit sub facility  expiring on december  we do not anticipate any short term borrowings for working capital as we believe our cash reserves and internally generated funds will be sufficient to sustain working capital requirements in however  our needs may change in the future 
because the global capital and credit markets have been severely constrained  we may not be able to obtain replacement financing or  even if we are able to obtain replacement financing  such financing may not be upon the same or substantially similar terms or may contain more onerous debt covenants that may be difficult for the company to achieve 
inability to obtain replacement financing in these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations

overview our customers are communication service providers from around the world 
our customers are continually searching for ways of providing innovative methods of connection that enable new means of communication 
in recent years  our customers have transitioned communication methods and content from the provision of voice communication alone to a combination of voice  video and data 
this transition has enabled the development of new means of communication and the provision of new services to users of communication technologies 
in addition  the networks that enable this communication have evolved from wireline telecommunications networks to include wireless  fiber  and other architectures offered by telecommunications operators  cable operators  and wireless carriers  as well as content providers 
as a result of these changes  the industry has evolved into a highly competitive environment where maintaining and expanding customer relationships are key to the survival of the communication provider s business model 
the company  as a leading producer of network assurance products  must also evolve in order to stay relevant to their business needs 
the company s goal is to continue to provide industry leading  cost effective service assurance solutions to our customers 
the company has evolved in response to these changes in technology through a focus primarily on the wireline access network segment of the market where we have an embedded base of customers for many of our traditional products and services 
however  we recognize that we must continue to evolve in order to remain relevant to the business requirements of our customers 
our goal is to continue to provide industry leading  cost effective service assurance solutions by extending our business into new network architectures and new areas of growth 
in  the company confronted the challenge posed by rising costs that arose from previous acquisitions coupled with declines in a number of our older product lines  some of which have been substantial 
our strategy was to focus on our core test and measurement competencies  but we also needed gain greater control of our cost base and reallocate resources to provide a solid foundation for growth 
for this reason  management expended significant time in examining our entire business 
we commenced a full strategic review in april with the assistance of an outside financial advisor 
we reviewed all opportunities available to the company  including a possible sale of the company  going private options  evaluating individual product lines  reformulating organic strategies  acquisition and merger alternatives  and stock buy back and dividend alternatives 
throughout the process  we reviewed industry growth opportunities in test and measurement and adjacent complementary market segments 
at the conclusion of the process  we had confirmed the significant potential of our worldwide embedded customer base  our success in system sales of centralized software solutions and remote test hardware  and the value of our long term service contracts 
as a result of the review  we determined that the appropriate strategy for the company was to focus our strategic efforts and resources on the substantial and growing telecom service assurance market  where we have a significant installed customer base  and use this position to expand into adjacent markets  develop an integrated software platform that will serve multiple applications and products for the telecom industry including the next generation ip service assurance market  secure new potential partnerships that we expect will enable us to allow us to expand our system solutions into adjacent market segments  continue to monitor and control costs in all areas of our business  look for opportunities to accelerate our business strategy while maintaining our focus on ongoing current initiatives  improve management team capabilities to support the refocused strategy  enhance company value through investment  organic growth and potential acquisitions that promote our strategic objectives  and initiate a million share repurchase program 

table of contents industry and market trends there were several trends across the company s markets that affected our performance in in addition to the industry trends  the economic environment was probably the single largest factor in shaping the year 
the global economy significantly weakened in the second half of as the banking crisis affected consumer and business spending 
our customers were impacted as businesses and consumers looked for ways to reduce their expenditures 
in turn  capital and operating expense budgets of our customers were and continue to be under pressure as they look to balance potential lower revenues 
marked another year of intense competition for both network equipment manufacturers as well as service providers 
in the service provider markets  competition between large telecommunications  cable and wireless providers intensified and simultaneously  new media entrants increased in numbers to compete against the larger carriers 
consolidation among carriers continued  with combinations such as verizon and alltel and  in addition  companies continued with integrations of past acquisitions 
in the network equipment manufacturer markets  large companies continued to dominate the infrastructure business 
however  due to the state of the economy and the intense competition in these markets  it is possible that certain large established companies may not survive in the current environment which may potentially open some markets for new entrants 
in the test and measurement markets  companies are competing to provide cost effective test capabilities for new services and new networks architectures 
many smaller companies have been acquired by larger entities looking to accelerate plans and expand product offerings 
was a difficult period for companies that serve the telecom and cable markets 
it was a challenging time for the service providers  as well  as they competed against each other for broadband triple play customers 
our experience is that service provider spending continues to be focused on next generation networks and services  with triple play services  product bundling  and creative service offerings at the forefront 
we believe that spending in test and measurement is equally focused in these areas  although spending to maintain existing networks and revenue streams continues to be necessary 
these factors and their effect on the company s business are described in more detail below under the captions customer line loss  investment in new infrastructure and technologies by our telecommunication customers  intense competition among telecommunications and cable service providers  consolidation in telecommunications market  alternative testing methods  and test and measurement markets continue to expand 
we expect the following trends will continue to impact our business in our customers are reducing their capital and operating expense budgets as they look to balance potential lower revenues due to the impact of the recession in the united states and other international economies  incumbent telephone carriers continue to lose customers and revenue to cable competitors  wireless substitution and alternate new media providers  our traditional customer base of incumbent telephone carriers especially the large domestic carriers have considerably slowed their investments in legacy areas and are focusing their capital spending on wireless and next generation wireline projects such as fiber to the home curb premise  iptv  and dsl services  triple play service  voice  video and data services competition is fierce and intensifying  adoption of open standards for in cable and telecommunications systems is resulting in increased competition  increased consolidation among large domestic carriers and others in the telecommunications industry  telecommunications customers continue to evaluate the benefits and costs of full service assurance solutions versus less robust integrated testing solutions  and other competing software solutions  and adjacent test and measurement markets continue to evolve and expand in areas that we did not traditionally pursue  such as the electric power industry 

table of contents customer line loss customer line loss continued to accelerate for most wire line carriers in of the large north american carriers  line loss was estimated at roughly year over year which has accelerated from previous years 
line loss has been driven by competition from wireless and cable providers and also the elimination of second phone lines due to dsl penetration 
an increasing driver for line loss is the replacement of copper lines with fiber to the home initiatives by carriers around the world 
while fiber to the home initiatives vary by country and region  they are on the rise globally 
we expect continued line loss over time based on the competitive factors outlined  but we do not see the wholesale replacement or rapid removal of the current copper infrastructure 
in much of the world  copper will remain a dominant access infrastructure for decades to come 
investment in new infrastructure and technologies by our telecommunications customers our telecommunications customers have considerably slowed their investments in existing network infrastructure and have shifted spending to transform their networks to next generation ip networks 
they have also shifted the access network spending to wireless  fiber architectures  and continued dsl enhancements 
we still derive a large percentage of our revenue from these customers 
as was the case in the past year  customers who have announced budgets for this year are spending less than the previous year 
many of our customers have indicated they will continue to use their current hybrid fiber copper networks utilizing dsl technology for the foreseeable future 
a small number of customers have embarked on fiber to the home programs 
these customers will continue to have copper infrastructure for many years 
fiber to the home programs  if implemented on a large scale globally  will continue to reduce demand for our copper based products 
however  these programs would offer additional opportunities for our software platforms as well as potential new hardware opportunities 
as opposed to fiber to the home  others are developing fiber to the node fttn projects  thereby leaving a portion of the copper network intact 
given the size and breadth of the present hybrid networks  we believe that the copper portion of the network will remain an important part of the telecommunications system for the foreseeable future 
as copper remains intact  the need for our copper based testing products should continue 
the company s strategy to respond to these trends is outlined in the section of this md a entitled our reponses to these industry trends that follows 
a review of the impact of these network trends on certain of the company s intangible assets is contained in the critical accounting policies section of this item intense competition among telecommunications and cable service providers the continuing evolution of the communications marketplace has resulted  and will continue to result  in intense competition among wireline and wireless telecommunications players  cable service providers and new media entrants 
deregulation and technological advances have allowed new competitors to enter the market to offer consumers increasing choice among a variety of communication services  including voice  data  and video services 
wire line competitors  including traditional phone carriers  cable providers  and dsl providers offer customers many choices with basic phone as well as bundled services including voice  video and data 
with the evolution of wireless networks  wireless carriers are increasingly able to offer competitive triple play services with the added benefit of mobility 
so called over the top content and service providers are also entering into the competitive environment with innovative services over the top of traditional cable  dsl and wireless connections 
as a result  competition among service providers has greatly increased and the industry has transformed from a highly regulated monopolistic model to a free market model 
as competitive pressures increase in the industry and the offerings expand to multiple access technologies  so does the pressure on our traditional copper based product lines 
our copper based test products still provide a significant portion of our overall revenue 
as carriers migrate spending to new architectures  we too need to expand our capabilities to new services and network architectures to diversify our business and provide long term growth opportunities for tollgrade in the market 
increased competition resulting from standardization through the adoption of open  non proprietary standards  the markets that we serve become increasingly competitive 
this is true for our cable status monitoring market  as well as developing markets like the iptv market 
in the cable market  standards such as hms and docsis have increased the competition we face resulting in downward pricing pressure 
cable providers continue to drive the adoption of higher speed broadband which is enabled through docsis and docsis network implementations 
with the introduction of iptv services  different vendors are promoting variations of proposed standards to accomplish the end to end provision and execution of the service 
while these proposed standards are evaluated by the standards bodies  the market 
table of contents remains fragmented 
once a standard is adopted  there will be winners and losers in the vendor community based on the methodology utilized to enable the service 
similarly  in the power utility market  there are multiple interoperability and communication standards that are developing 
as end to end solution offerings are pulled together by vendors  choices are made on the underlying protocols and communication methods 
in both of these markets  the company is adopting a similar strategy as is described below in the section entitled our responses to these industry trends 
consolidation in telecommunications market competition in the telecommunications market has had the secondary effect of resulting in the consolidation of many of the telecommunications service providers 
while the company has benefited to a certain extent from competition because of the potential new service provider customers brought into the market  competition has also driven consolidation 
consolidation itself can have benefits or also may cause adverse issues for the company 
consolidation has caused delays in or loss of customer orders and increasing pricing pressures 
however  we have also seen consolidation provide us a much stronger relationship with a number of customers and expansion of business into acquired areas of networks 
recently  we have seen expansion of current customers into new countries organically  as well as customers selling territories or assets based on strategic or regulatory reasons 
while it is difficult to predict in the immediate term the affect with regard to consolidation  we do expect consolidations to continue in the future as carriers look to expand territory and service offerings to better serve their customers 
there has also been significant consolidation in the vendors serving the telecommunications industry 
during the year  there was continued consolidation and integration of past acquisitions among network equipment manufacturers 
large companies continue to dominate the infrastructure business with the likes of ericsson  nokia siemens  cisco  huawei and others 
we expect further consolidation in the future  in particular due to the financial crisis and the impacts on companies that took on significant debt 
while the company is a relatively small participant in an industry filled with much larger companies  we see opportunities arising from these consolidations to increase our business and our relationships with key customers 
it will be difficult to predict how this industry consolidation will impact the company s business in the near and more distant future  however  the company is focused on exiting the economic downturn in a much stronger position financially and competitively than it entered 
alternative testing methods our traditional products involve the sale and support of test systems including hardware probes coupled with centralized software platforms 
in an industry as dynamic as the telecommunications industry  many options currently exist for testing new service offerings and network architectures 
the company faces competition from companies offering test systems similar to our own offerings  but we also face competition from network equipment providers  software providers  new hardware test companies  as well as the internal it departments of our customers 
network equipment providers are increasingly offering basic testing technology embedded into their products 
while many of these competitors offer limited testing capabilities  in certain cases  it may be sufficient for the customer s short term requirements 
we continue to believe that more robust testing technology is important for next generation network assurance needs  however  if more customers choose the limited testing capabilities  it will have an adverse affect on our business overall 
based on our refocused strategy  software test providers and internal it departments have also become competitors to our expansion into new software testing capabilities 
we face competition from both large and small companies offering software solutions with partial capabilities as compared to our software platforms 
our customers internal it departments are also competing with our software offerings  given their development capabilities and knowledge of their own unique networks 
finally  there is emerging competition from new test and measurement hardware vendors 
hardware costs continue to decrease and as technology advances are incorporated  these new designs can be effectively deployed in areas where it would have been cost prohibitive in the past 
test and measurement markets continue to expand test and measurement markets continue to evolve and expand 
segments within our existing markets as well as completely new markets are opening to the benefits of test and measurement products 
adjacent segments such as centralized fiber test and centralized wireless test are growing and offer potential new areas of expansion for the company 
we expect that our expertise in centralized test systems and software platforms will enable the company to expand our expertise into these new areas 
our customer incumbency also provides the company a competitive advantage against new entrants and existing competitors 

table of contents the centralized power utility test market is a new and growing opportunity to further develop the company s strengths and testing expertise 
the electric utility industry is in a tremendous period of change with increased public and political pressure for environmental and capacity improvements 
we believe that regulatory changes for improved reliability cannot be met without new hardware and software  and that the reporting requirements alone will require new capabilities 
the electric utilities are looking to next generation network architectures and new technology to improve the performance and reliability of the nation s power grid 
with the recently approved government stimulus package  funding for improvements to the electric grid is available and much focus from the government is being placed on evolving to a truly smart grid 
our responses to these industry trends the rapid evolution of the markets that we operate in and target requires us to constantly evaluate our business strategy 
we evaluate our market position  internal capabilities  and the possible options for the company to pursue 
we strive to balance investment activities with financial performance and manage the risk of our actions 
in response to these industry trends  the company expended significant time and effort in in conducting a full strategic review of all aspects of its business and potential strategic alternatives 
as described above  following completion of this review  the company determined to focus its strategic efforts and resources on the telecom service assurance market  where we have an installed customer base  and use this position to expand into adjacent markets 
in furtherance of our refocused strategy  we continue to focus on a number of areas 
first  we intend to extend our solution offerings to next generation networks and services 
we continue to add capabilities to our existing hardware products and also to extend software capabilities to next generation networks 
second  we intend to aggressively protect our network assurance leadership position in the access network by strengthening our existing customer relationships with new extensions of our existing products 
we will defend our position against our competition while increasing our value to our customers 
third  as we also need to develop products in new areas of growth to be successful in the longer term  we intend to expand our reach into new markets 
in this area  we are looking to expand our telecommunications network assurance offerings as well as exploit new area such as the power utility market 
and finally  we intend to improve our operating efficiency through improvements to our operating structure that will provide long term benefits 
telecommunications solutions our telecommunications solutions are the focus of our business 
as a result of our strategic review process  we concluded that our embedded customer base  system sales expertise  and our long term service contracts were significant assets to leverage in our telecom business 
we also determined that our best opportunity for improving the company s long term performance was to build upon the strength of the company s test system software platforms  which is at the center of our network service assurance offerings 
we believe our expanded service assurance strategy  if successful  can provide long term growth to enhance the value of tollgrade for the benefit of our shareholders 
we believe that by focusing on our service assurance solutions we can expand our addressable market  use our incumbent position with customers as a platform to provide solutions and services in new areas and thereby enhance the value of our long term contracts 
we began to actively implement this strategy during the fourth quarter of and will continue to pursue this strategy in we also see areas to extend this strategy through our service offerings  in addition to our software strategy 
we believe the strength of our relationships allows us the opportunity to expand our service offerings into new capabilities  including significant outsourcing and managed service offerings 
these services  coupled with our hardware and software capabilities  could provide a strong base with significant opportunity beyond the current product offerings 
with our software strategy  we believe there is an opportunity to utilize a single software platform to serve multiple applications and product areas 
we intend to use our tel and loopcare software incumbency and extend testing coverage to next generation network architectures 
as discussed in the industry trends  many new network elements have embedded test and monitoring functions 
these functions and the data from these elements can be integrated in to an overall access network service assurance solution 
data from these systems can be acquired  analyzed and presented to the customer call center users much the same way as our current systems do today 
we are in the process of extending our software platforms to take advantage of this new exposed network data and integrate such data with and into our dispatch analysis system 
this will allow the operators to continue their existing business processes while we extend their test coverage to new services in a manner that does not require customers to add additional technical skills to their organizations 
these new software capabilities can be coupled with our own test probe hardware  or it can be offered as a stand alone as a software solution 
we have and will continue to include customer input and feedback into our strategy in this area 
we continue to actively promote and sell our telecommunication hardware product lines 
coupled with our software platforms  we offer a complete integrated testing system with our hardware 
our latest ip service assurance test probe  the digitest ice  is squarely aimed at testing triple play voice  video and data services over emerging fiber to the curb or cabinet broadband 
table of contents access networks 
these lower line count remote sites require cost optimized test probes and greater ip test capabilities to fulfill the requirements of triple play testing 
our ice roadmap includes additional ip test capabilities as well as ethernet test features 
with ice  the customer will be able to quickly isolate voip  iptv and high speed internet access troubles  verify the network performance  and synch with broadband equipment to validate connectivity and throughput 
the digitest ice was designed to provide both metallic and multi layered dsl testing to help service providers install and maintain broadband triple play services within traditional and hybrid fiber copper networks 
we also continue to actively market and sell our other digitest hardware products as well as the ldu and n x test product families 
we continue to look for opportunities to consolidate our product lines where possible 
we will continue to manage the opportunities for legacy product lines versus the costs of maintaining them 
cable solutions for over years  we have competed in the cable status monitoring market 
in  we purchased the cheetah product line from acterna  llc to expand our position in the market and expand upon our customer relationships 
with the addition of the cheetah product line  we became a supplier of status monitoring hardware and software to nearly every major cable company 
since  it has been a challenge to replace the revenue provided by proprietary status monitoring products while we introduce docsis based status monitoring products 
simultaneously  increased competition  reduced margins through rapidly declining prices  and key outbound relationships were challenged 
we have worked to re establish our outbound relationships with oem and channel partners and develop new and innovative products to bring to the marketplace 
at the end of  we introduced our new single chip embedded cable modem technology  which enables us to increase functionality while standardizing a single cable modem across our entire cable product line 
we expect that the availability of this technology will help to address both our margin related issues as well as introducing an improved and more competitive product line 
we also introduced our first docsis based fiber node monitoring product in we see this as a new market segment that offers growth potential across multiple partner relationships 
in  we are planning to introduce additional varieties of transponders for multiple fiber node manufacturers to increase our market coverage and growth opportunity 
we are also introducing an end of line monitoring product which connects to the end of the hybrid fiber coax branch and provides a remote test point for measuring the video channels and the docsis channel to perform remote tilt measurements as well as automated fcc level testing 
this is a new product that offers expansion opportunities into new areas that are not as price sensitive and competitive as our traditional transponder market segments 
we continue to explore strategic opportunities with our cable business 
we have an impressive installed base of customers  outbound oem partners  and overall product portfolio 
we will continue to support our existing customers to ensure the value of our products and services 
while we have seen declines in our cable revenue based on reduced market demand in traditional products  we are attempting to replace those declines through other customer accounts and new product offerings 
expansion into adjacent and other market segments as part of our strategy to expand into adjacent and new market segments  starting in  we began investigating the power utility industry for expansion opportunities 
this led to the prototype and beta product trials in of our lighthouse system with potential new utility customers 
this activity culminated in the general availability of the first version of the solution offering in the first quarter of this development effort was also intended to diversify and expand the company s business opportunities 
much of the underlying lighthouse system components are similar to those in our telecommunications and cable solutions  which lowered our market entry costs while increasing the probability of successful product development  stability and features 
in the power utility market  we are again focused on the access side of the utility network  from the substation out to the end customers 
this area of the network is largely unmonitored and utilities have very little real time proactive data to manage this section of the network 
many issues are causing utilities to focus on increased monitoring and real time management of their network 
the aging of distribution assets is causing increased reliability problems while regulatory pressure is driving new reliability standards 
an aging workforce is causing a shortage of skilled labor and an increasing demand for automation 
this convergence of factors  coupled with the current stimulus package represents a market window of opportunity for our solution 
similar to our other market solutions  our solution consists of hardware sensors  aggregation points and a centralized software platform 
the hardware sensors sit directly on medium voltage lines which monitor current  electric field  conductor temperature and harmonics  reporting significant events such as faults  outages  and power restoration 
the aggregator collects all of the data coming wirelessly from the line sensors and connects into the utility s data network passing the data to our software platform 
the centralized software platform is a server based architecture that consolidates all measurements and events  provides map based viewing and analysis  and also provides northbound interfaces to other systems like outage management and supervisory control and data acquisition systems scada via standard application program interfaces apis 

table of contents we believe that smart grid sensors and software to remotely monitor expensive equipment can enable electric utilities to meet demands for improved grid reliability  faster response to disturbances  increased energy efficiency and more cost effective management of assets 
we are developing a sensor technology that will provide utilities with a snapshot of the grid s current status for fault and equipment problem location and historical data to enable better economic decisions about asset operations and maintenance  plus more accurate load research and forecasting 
our value proposition focuses on providing outage identification and fault location as well as asset management and system planning capabilities for our customers 
we help our customers improve the reliability of their distribution networks 
we also see significant opportunities in adjacent market segments in areas such as managed services and outsourcing  optical fiber test systems  wireless network service assurance  among others 
we continue to explore a variety of new areas for the company to determine if there is an appropriate market entry point and differentiated product offerings that we can provide 
diversification and acquisitions we have historically focused our efforts in test and measurement products targeted at both telecommunications and cable service providers 
since  we have made four acquisitions  allowing us to consolidate our positions in telecommunications line test and cable status monitoring markets 
while this consolidation strategy provided for relatively stable financial performance  it has not provided significant growth opportunities for the business 
the acquisitions allowed the company to consolidate our positions in markets with stable to declining revenue potential 
we have strong positions in a number of these segments that can be used to support our strategy going forward 
our focus now is to identify  plan and enter growth markets 
in august  we acquired the broadband test division btd from teradyne  inc this acquisition significantly enhanced our global reach in our core test and measurement market and allowed us to diversify our telecom business and consolidate the telecom line test market 
the revenue footprint of btd was largely international  such that our revenue from international customers was  and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   sales to customers in the americas excluding the united states were approximately million or of international sales  sales to customers in emea were million or of international sales  and sales to customers in asia pacific were million or of international sales 
for the year ended december   sales to customers in the americas excluding the united states were approximately million or of international sales  sales to customers in emea were million or of international sales  and sales to customers in asia pacific were million or of international sales 
for the year ended december   sales to customers in the americas excluding the united states were approximately million or of international sales  sales to customers in emea were million or of international sales  and sales to customers in asia pacific were million or of international sales 
furthermore  the company enjoys a stream of software maintenance revenue from international sources  which was strengthened as a result of our btd acquisition 
we will look to utilize our cash resources for additional use in ongoing business or strategic partnerships and other transactions to accelerate our strategy 
one key to the refocused strategic approach is to engage in partnerships  whether with technology or business partners 
partnerships can allow us to expand our system solutions into adjacent market segments  while mitigating certain risks 
we actively manage our product portfolio based on the market opportunity  risk and contribution level to the business 
we will look at opportunities to accelerate our time to market and expansion into adjacent markets where possible 
while we look to capitalize on the strength of partnerships  we will examine and entertain acquisition and merger opportunities if they are in the best interests of our shareholders and the long term growth of the business 
we continue to explore alternatives to enhance and expand our test and measurement global footprint to strengthen our position in our core or adjacent markets 
realignment of resources in the first quarter of  the company initiated certain strategic initiatives designed to better align its resources with growth opportunities in current  adjacent and new markets 
in addition  as part of the realignment initiative  the company reallocated resources in to the new lighthouse product initiative as described above 
should the company find that the measures taken to date are not sufficient  other cost or strategy initiatives may be implemented 
in october  the company announced the results of the strategic alternatives review and our refocused strategy 
as the strategy is implemented  additional resources were shifted to new product initiatives  moving them from older product lines 
this activity will continue as we move forward and examine new market segments that we believe offer opportunity for long term growth 

table of contents other company trends in addition to the industry and product trends that we have already discussed  our operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate from time to time as a result of various other factors  including the timing of orders from  shipments to  and acceptance of software by  the large domestic carrier customers and significant international and independent telephone companies 
this timing is particularly sensitive to various business factors unique to each of our larger customers  including their relationships with various organized labor groups and a tendency for some of them to place large orders for shipment of hardware and software toward the end of a quarter  which may result in orders placed in one quarter not being filled until the next period 
furthermore  our product sales have become more project oriented in the last few years  with large portions of revenue from those projects being conditioned on acceptance of large orders or phases  which might move from quarter to quarter 
in addition  the markets for some of our products  such as our system test products and cable products  are highly competitive 
due to the rapidly evolving market in which these products compete  additional competitors with significant market presence and financial resources could further intensify the competition for these products 
we believe that the changes outlined above and others within the telecommunications marketplace  industry consolidation  as well as our continuing efforts to expand our customer base and product offerings  have required us to grant more favorable terms to some of our customers  which has and is expected to continue to result in pressure to our gross margins 
although we will continue to strive to meet the demands of our customers  which include delivery of quality products at an acceptable price on acceptable terms  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating acceptable terms and conditions with our customers or that these continuing efforts by our large domestic carrier customers to consolidate their inventory and product procurement systems will not cause fluctuations or delays in our order patterns or order cancellations 
our results reflected revenues from services of approximately  compared to approximately and in and  respectively 
the increase in revenues from services in is attributed to the contribution from revenues from our btd acquisition on august   which had largely a service oriented revenue base 
further  we expect predictability of revenues from this portion of the business to improve 
during  the remainder of our revenue  or of the consolidated total  was comprised of sales of software and hardware products to new or existing customers 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the application of certain of these accounting principles is more critical than others in gaining an understanding of the basis upon which our financial statements have been prepared 
we consider the following accounting policies to involve critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition we market and sell test system hardware and related software to the telecommunications and cable industries 
the company follows staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  for hardware and software sales 
this bulletin requires  among other things  that revenue should be recognized only when title has transferred and risk of loss has passed to a customer with the capability to pay  and that there are no significant remaining obligations of the company related to the sale 
the bulk of our hardware sales are made to the large domestic carriers and european telcos and other large customers 
delivery terms of hardware sales are predominantly fob origin 
revenue is recognized for these customers upon shipment against a valid purchase order 
where title and risk of loss do not pass to the customer until the product reaches the customer s delivery site  revenue is deferred unless the company can objectively determine delivery occurred before the end of the applicable reporting period 
we reduce collection risk by requiring letters of credit or other payment guarantees for significant sales to new customers and or those in weak financial condition 
for perpetual software license fee and maintenance revenue  we follow the aicpa s statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
this statement requires that software license fee revenue be recorded only when evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the software has been delivered  and a customer with the capacity to pay has accepted the software  leaving no significant obligations on the part of the company to perform 
we require a customer purchase order or other written agreement to document the terms of a software order and written  unqualified acceptance from the customer prior to revenue recognition 
in certain limited cases  however  agreements provide for automatic customer acceptance after the passage of time from a pre determined event and we have relied on these provisions for an indication of the timing of revenue recognition 
in isolated cases for orders of custom software  or orders that require significant software customization  such as those associated with our contracts for products deployed in saudi arabia  we employ contract accounting using the percentage of completion method  whereby revenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the revenue for orders with multiple deliverables such as hardware  software and or installation or other services may be separated into stand alone fair values if not already documented in the purchase order or agreement and where list prices or other objective evidence of fair value exists to support such allocation  in accordance with 
table of contents the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue will not be recognized for any single element until all elements considered essential to the functionality of the delivered elements under the contract are delivered and accepted 
the recognition of revenue under eitf requires certain judgment by management 
if any undelivered elements  which can include hardware  software or services  are essential to the functionality of the system as defined in the contract  revenue will not be recorded until all of the items considered essential are delivered as one unit of accounting 
our internal policy requires that we obtain a written acceptance from our customers for each specific customer situation where new products are sold 
revenue will not be recorded until written acceptance is received from the customer 
although infrequent  in some situations contingencies will be noted by the customer on the written acceptance 
in these situations  management will use judgment to determine the importance of such contingencies for recognizing revenue related to the sale 
the company s general practice is to defer revenue recognition unless these contingencies are inconsequential 
our software customers usually enter into separate agreements for software maintenance upon expiration of the stated software warranty period 
maintenance agreements include software upgrades and bug fixes as they become available  however  newly developed features must be purchased separately 
post warranty maintenance for new features is either included under the current maintenance agreement without additional charge  and is considered in the maintenance agreement fees  or is separately charged upon expiration of the warranty 
depending upon the timing of the new feature purchase and the length of the maintenance agreement  we must evaluate whether or not a portion of a perpetual right to use fee should be treated as post contract support to be deferred and recognized over the remaining life of the maintenance agreement 
software maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the period the respective arrangements are in effect 
revenue recognition  especially for software products  involves critical judgments and decisions that can result in material effects to reported net income 
goodwill and intangible assets at december   we had net intangible assets of million resulting from the acquisitions of the loopcare product line in september  the cheetah product line in february  the test business of emerson in february and the broadband test division of teradyne  inc in august in connection with these acquisitions  we utilized the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which were issued in july sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  and that goodwill  as well as any indefinite lived intangible assets  not be amortized for financial reporting purposes 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis or an accelerated method  whichever better reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the asset are consumed or otherwise used 
software related intangible assets are amortized based on the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life 
sensitivity analysis certain portions of the telecom market serviced by the company s products are evolving and  when appropriate  management reviews the impact of such changes on the key assumptions underlying the valuation of each of its intangible assets 
technological advances  as well as potential changes in strategic direction by any of the company s key telecom or cable customers  could result in an impairment or substantial reduction in one or more of the estimated lives over which the respective intangible asset s is are currently being amortized 
the following table lists intangible assets with a remaining life at december  
table of contents years twelve month remaining carrying rolling life at value at projected asset description life amortization in millions loopcare base software post warranty maintenance service agreements emerson proprietary technology broadband test division post warranty maintenance service agreements post warranty maintenance service agreements post warranty maintenance service agreements post warranty maintenance service agreements technology customer relationships other in the event that the company would reevaluate the above estimated useful lives in the future due to changed events and circumstances  annual amortization would increase based on the respective intangible asset s carrying value and revised remaining useful life 
goodwill and indefinite lived assets we review our finite lived intangible assets or fixed assets and their related useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable  including a change in the competitive landscape  any internal decisions to pursue new or different technology strategies  a loss of a significant customer  or a significant change in the market place including changes in the prices paid for our products or changes in the size of the market for our products 
an impairment results if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and disposition of the asset or the period of economic benefit has changed 
if impairment were indicated  the amount of the impairment would be determined by comparing the carrying value of the asset group to the fair value of the asset group 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate 
the projection of the future cash flows and the selection of a discount rate require significant management judgment 
the key assumptions that management must estimate include sales volume  prices  inflation  product costs  capital expenditures and sales and marketing costs 
for developed technology  we also must estimate the likelihood of both pursuing a particular strategy and the level of expected market adoption 
due to a decline in the trading price of the company s shares during the fourth quarter of  in addition to a revision in revenue projections for  the results of our review indicated that our goodwill was entirely impaired  and in connection therewith we recorded a non cash charge in the fourth quarter of of approximately million 
certain other indefinite lived assets were reviewed and impairment charges of million were recorded in the fourth quarter of we also assigned a definite life to these assets at december  
table of contents due to our lower than expected operating results for the first quarter of  subsequent to quarter end  management undertook a review of our revenue and earnings expectations for the remainder of the year 
as a result of this review  in april  management made significant revisions to its financial outlook 
these revisions were based on lower than expected second quarter results and deepening concerns about the impact of further deteriorations in general economic conditions and the resulting effect on our markets 
as a result  management determined that certain long lived assets primarily in our cable business were impaired  and as a result we recorded non cash charges during the first quarter of of approximately million 
during the fourth quarter  based on our review of the financial outlook  there were no triggering events and no further asset impairments were required 
inventory valuation we utilize a standard cost system that approximates first in  first out costing of the products 
standards are monitored monthly and changes are made on individual parts if warranted  otherwise standard costs are updated on all parts annually  normally in november of each year 
excess capacity is not included in the standard cost of inventory 
we evaluate our inventories on a monthly basis for slow moving  excess and obsolete stock on hand 
the carrying value of such inventory that is determined not to be realizable is reduced  in whole or in part  by a charge to cost of sales and reduction of the inventory value in the financial statements 
the evaluation process  which has been consistently followed  relies in large part on a review of inventory items that have not been sold  purchased or used in production within a one year period 
management also reviews  where appropriate  inventory products that do not meet this threshold but which may be unrealizable due to discontinuance of products  evolving technologies  loss of certain customers or other known factors 
as a result of this comprehensive review process  an adjustment to the reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory is normally made monthly 
inventory identified as obsolete is also discarded from time to time when circumstances warrant 
inventory realization is considered a critical accounting estimate since it relies in large part on management judgments as to future events and differing judgments could materially affect reported net income 
during the first quarter of  tollgrade announced a restructuring program which included the discontinuance of various products that are not part of the company s strategic focus 
as a result of this review  we recorded an inventory write down of million for the year ended december  allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance is based on our assessment of the collectability of customer accounts 
we regularly review the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience  credit quality  age of the accounts receivable balances  and current conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  or if other circumstances arise  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  and an additional allowance could be required  which could have an adverse impact on our revenue 
income taxes we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  in reporting the effects of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we evaluate all deferred tax assets based on our current outlook  and  as of december   substantially all us federal and state deferred tax assets and certain foreign net deferred tax assets  except to the extent of deferred tax liabilities  have been eliminated through the recording of a valuation allowance  as we are presently unable to determine that it is more likely than not that these net deferred tax assets will be realized 
on january   the company adopted financial standards accounting board interpretation no  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
the adoption of this interpretation did not require a material cumulative effect 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain positions in income tax expense 
warranty we provide warranty coverage on our various products 
terms of coverage range from up to one year on software to two to five years for hardware products 
we review products returned for repair under warranty on a quarterly basis and adjust the accrual for future warranty costs based upon cumulative returns experience 
we also evaluate special warranty problems for products with high return rates to correct the underlying causes and  where deemed necessary  to provide additional warranty expense for expected higher 
table of contents returns of these products 
warranty costs associated with software sales are also accrued based on the projected hours to be incurred during the warranty period normally three months 
the accounting for warranty costs involves critical estimates and judgments that can have a material effect on net income 
long lived assets held for sale we classify long lived assets as held for sale when certain criteria are met  including management s commitment to a plan to sell the assets and has the authority to approve the action  the availability of the assets for immediate sale in their present condition  whether an active program to locate buyers and other actions to sell the assets has been initiated  whether the sale of the assets is probable and their transfer is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year  whether the assets are being marketed at reasonable prices in relation to their fair value  and how unlikely it is that significant changes will be made to the plan to sell the assets 
we measure long lived assets to be disposed of by sale at the lower of carrying amounts or fair value less cost to sell 
fair value for the assets held for sale is determined based on management s estimates of market value 
for those product line net assets where management has committed to a plan to divest  all product line assets are be valued at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell 
if the carrying amount of the product line assets exceeds its estimated fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
fair values are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model  valuation performed by third parties  earning multiples  or indicative bids  when available 
a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques  including the forecasting of markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  cost and expenses  and multiple other factors 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time estimates are made  however  the fair values that are ultimately realized upon the sale of product line net assets to be divested may differ from the estimated fair values reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
depreciation is no longer recorded on product line assets which are to be divested once they are classified as held for sale 
for product line assets classified as assets held for sale  the balance sheet and cash flow amounts are reclassified from their historical presentation to assets and liabilities of operations held for sale 
restructuring accrual in july  we implemented a restructuring program based on our business strategies and economic outlook to increase efficiency and reduce costs 
in connection with these strategic initiatives  we recorded estimated expenses associated with employee severance  relocation and lease termination costs 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  generally costs associated with restructuring activities initiated after december  have been recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
however  in the case of leases  the expense is estimated and accrued when the property is vacated 
given the significance and the timing of execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and sub lease rents 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
in the first quarter of  the company implemented additional restructuring initiatives as part of our strategic plan aimed at increasing efficiency and reducing costs 
these initiatives were intended to realign existing resources to new projects  reduce the company s engineering staff for better alignment of resources with opportunities  make changes in field service and sales staffing to reflect continuing consolidations among our customer base and full integration of prior acquisitions  and reduce the number of senior management positions as a result of integrating talent from acquisitions along with a review of the management structure 
during the first quarter of  the company eliminated approximately positions and an additional positions were reassigned to new projects 
in addition  a comprehensive review of all consolidated incentives was completed  and certain product lines were discontinued as they were not considered strategic to the company s marketing plan going forward 
during the fourth quarter  remaining charges associated with this restructuring were insignificant 
pension benefits we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for three employees based in germany  four employees based in belgium and two employees based in the netherlands 
accounting for the cost of these plans requires the estimation of the cost of the benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the expected work life of employees participating in these plans 
this estimation requires our judgment about the discount rate used to determine these obligations  rate of future compensation increases  withdrawal and mortality rates and participant retirement age 
differences between our estimates and actual results may significantly affect the cost of our obligations under these plans 

table of contents in the valuation of this pension benefit liability  management utilizes various assumptions 
we determine our discount rate based on an investment grade bond yield curve with a duration that approximates the benefit payment timing of each plan 
this rate can fluctuate based on changes in investment grade bond yields 
future compensation rates  withdrawal rates and participant retirement age are determined based on historical information 
these assumptions are not expected to significantly change 
mortality rates are determined based on a review of published mortality tables 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense for all stock options and restricted stock awards over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service substantive vesting period 
we utilize the black scholes valuation method to establish fair value of all awards 
the black scholes valuation method requires that we make certain estimates regarding estimated forfeiture rates  expected holding period and stock price volatility 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payments awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  the company adjusts share based compensation on a quarterly basis for changes to the estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on actual forfeiture experience 
the effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for expense amortization after january  is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
foreign currency translation assets and liabilities of our international operations are translated into us united states dollars using quarter end or year end exchange rates  while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates throughout the year 
the resulting net translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the local currency is the functional currency for all of our locations 
these areas involving critical accounting estimates are periodically reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue revenue for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  from our revenue of million for the year ended december  the decline was across all product lines except services 
services increased million in largely due to the inclusion of a full year s revenue contribution from the contracts acquired in connection with the btd acquisition in the third quarter of services revenue consists of installation oversight and product management services provided to customers and fees from software maintenance agreements 
service revenues were approximately million in compared to million in the increase in is largely due to the inclusion of a full year s revenue contribution from contracts acquired from the btd acquisition 
services revenues accounted for approximately of revenue  compared to of revenue 
sales of our mcu product line in were million  compared to million in the previous year  which represents a decrease of approximately million  or 
while the mcu is a mature product  it continued to provide meaningful contribution to revenue and margin in the decline in mcu revenue was primarily due to the non recurrence of a large project in one of our major domestic carriers  as well as lower capital spending by our customers in traditional pots networks 
the mcu product line accounted for approximately of revenue  compared to of our revenue 
sales of the company s system test product lines including sales of stand alone loopcare  tel  and celerity software products were million  a decrease of approximately million  or from the prior year 
system test product line revenues decreased in primarily as a result of the conclusion of certain international projects involving digitest products at the 
table of contents end of this decline was offset  in part  by increased sales of ldu products and software applications in both international and domestic markets and our first domestic sale of the digitest ice product 
the system test product line revenue accounted for of revenue compared to of revenue 
during  we continued to experience lower sales to independent carriers than those experienced in due to changes in network deployment architecture 
we expect to see this trend continue at least for the near term  but new product solutions  including the digitest ice product  need to rapidly gain market share in order to offset these declines 
we do not expect revenues in these markets to return to historical levels unless the modifications that we have made to our product offerings  specifically digitest ice  begin to gain market traction 
sales of cable hardware and software products were million in  a decrease of million  or from our revenue of million for the year ended december   which included a large bulk buy of transponder hardware early in that year  which did not recur in overall sales of cable hardware and software products were of revenue  a decrease from of revenue 
sales of cable hardware and software are largely dependent on sales to one large oem partner and directly to certain domestic msos 
during  the company experienced declines from both of these customer segments due to overall declines in macroeconomic conditions  decline in demand for the current generation of the company s cable product offerings and the continued effect of sales of competitive docsis based equipment into our customer accounts 
gross profit gross profit for was million compared to million for  a decrease of approximately million  or  from the previous year 
the decrease in gross profit was due primarily to the approximate decline in revenue 
additionally  gross profit for included charges related to impairments of certain intangible assets as well as inventory obsolescence charges associated with the company s move to two new contract manufacturers from a former contract manufacturer  totaling million 
these charges were million higher than similar charges recorded in gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to for from for this decrease as a percentage of revenue is due primarily to the increase in impairment and inventory related charges 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs as well as commissions and travel expenses of direct sales and marketing personnel  and costs associated with various promotions and related marketing programs 
selling and marketing expenses for were million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues for the decrease in selling and marketing expenses is primarily due to reductions in the work force which occurred in early and declines in stock compensation  travel and consulting fees 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  administrative and general management personnel as well as accounting  legal and insurance expenses 
general and administrative expenses for were million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenues for the decrease is primarily attributable to the reversal of stock compensation expense in related to forfeiture of performance based restricted shares that were granted to certain members of management in research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and other costs associated with the development of new products and technologies  including the digitest  ldu  cheetah  loopcare  tel  and lighthouse product lines 
research and development expenses for were million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue for the decrease in research and development expense is primarily due to reductions in the work force which occurred in early restructuring programs during the first quarter of  the company announced a restructuring program which included the realignment of existing resources to new projects  reductions in the company s engineering staff  changes in field service and sales staffing and a reduction in the number of senior management positions 
the total expense associated with the restructuring program recorded in was million including a million charge for inventory associated with products that were no longer part of the company s future strategic focus 
this program was completed in and no additional expense is expected

the majority of the cash payments made under the restructuring program pertained to the remaining obligation for lease termination costs related to the company s former sarasota  florida facility 
with the payment of these costs  this lease was terminated during the first quarter in conjunction with the acquisition of btd  the company committed to a plan to close the acquired deerfield  illinois facility and to relocate from the then existing bracknell  england location to another facility within bracknell  england
