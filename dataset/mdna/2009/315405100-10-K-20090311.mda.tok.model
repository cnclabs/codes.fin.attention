item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview market conditions became more difficult as progressed 
some markets that were relatively strong through the first three quarters of the year weakened in the fourth quarter 
other markets  including those related to construction and appliances exhibited reduced demand throughout the year compared with  but demand from customers serving these markets also slowed sharply in the final three months of the year 
net sales increased during sales growth was relatively strong in the first nine months of the year  driven by a combination of increased product prices  including pass throughs of higher precious metals costs  and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
sales declined in the final three months of the year  compared with the fourth quarter of  due to lower sales volumes resulting from global economic weakness and the effects of difficult credit markets 
lower precious metal prices and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates also contributed to the decline in sales during the fourth quarter of for the full year  sales growth was strongest in our electronic materials segment 
sales also increased in performance coatings  polymer additives and color and glass performance materials 
sales declined in specialty plastics  primarily as a result of weak customer demand from customers serving the construction  automotive and appliance markets 
beyond fundamental product demand  the factors that most influenced results included the following cost control initiatives  including costs associated with our restructuring programs  charges for the impairment of goodwill and other assets  resulting from reduced expectations for future cash flows from several of our businesses  and volatile raw material costs 

table of contents prices for many raw materials used in our products were volatile throughout the year 
raw material cost generally increased during the first nine months of  then began to decline from their peaks as commodity prices fell late in the year 
on aggregate  raw material costs increased during the year compared with selling  general and administrative sg a expenses declined during the year 
the decline was primarily the result of expense reduction efforts in the last three months of  as we took actions to respond to reduced customer demand for our products 
for the year  sg a expense declined as a percentage of sales 
impairment charges of million related to goodwill and other long lived assets were recorded in our performance coatings  specialty plastics and electronic materials businesses 
goodwill was impaired related to tile coatings products in the performance coatings segment  and goodwill and property  plant and equipment were impaired related to plastics products in our specialty plastics segment 
the impairments were due to lower forecasted cash flows in the businesses resulting from significant reductions in demand from customers due to the current worldwide economic downturn 
in addition  we recorded an impairment of property  plant and equipment in our electronic materials facility in the netherlands 
this asset impairment was the result of a decline in the operating results and reduced future sales projections for our dielectric material products that are produced at the netherlands facility 
restructuring charges increased in  related to our manufacturing rationalization programs in our inorganic materials manufacturing operations in europe  additional manufacturing rationalization in the united states and latin america  and other restructuring activity to reduce worldwide costs and expenses 
interest expense declined in  primarily as a result of lower interest rates on our debt 
during the year  we issued new convertible bonds 
the proceeds from the new bonds  along with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility  were used to repay our coupon senior notes  due january the repayment of the senior notes resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of million during the year 
loss from continuing operations declined in compared with  primarily as a result of lower impairment charges  lower sg a expense and reduced interest expense 
these benefits were partially offset by higher restructuring charges and the loss on extinguishment of debt 
during  we sold the fine chemicals business that was previously part of our other businesses segment 
as a consequence of the sale  the results from fine chemicals are now included in discontinued operations for all periods 
as a result of the sale of fine chemicals  we recorded a gain on disposal of discontinued operations during outlook general economic conditions deteriorated sharply during the last three months of  as major regional economies around the world experienced reduced activity and were negatively affected by weak global credit markets 
demand from our customers who serve markets such as construction  automobiles and appliances  which had been weak through most of  contracted more quickly in the fourth quarter as consumer buying was curtailed 
this weakness is expected to continue at least through the first half of  and will negatively affect sales across our product lines 
we expect to continue to record charges associated with our current and future restructuring programs  as we proceed with our initiatives to rationalize manufacturing operations in europe  and as we adjust our worldwide operations to be in line with reduced customer demand 
factors that could adversely affect our future financial performance are contained within risk factors included under item a

at december   we had borrowed million of the revolver and had million available  after reductions for standby letters of credit secured by this facility 
at december   we had borrowed million in term loans 
in  we began making periodic principal payments on the term loans 
we are required to make minimum quarterly principal payments of million from january to july during the last year of the loan s life  we are required to repay the remaining balance of the term loans in four quarterly installments 
currently  those last four payments will be million each 
in addition to the minimum quarterly payments  each april we may be required to make an additional principal payment 
the amount of this additional payment is dependent on the company s leverage and certain cash flow metrics 
any additional payment that is required reduces  on a dollar for dollar basis  the amount due in the last four quarterly payments 
in april  we made an additional principal payment of million 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants of the amended credit facility 
at february   we had borrowed million of the revolver and had million available  after reductions for standby letters of credit secured by this facility 
the february   borrowings represent an increase of million since december   of which million is attributable to our decision to cash collateralize certain of our precious metals consignment arrangements 
for further discussion of our precious metals program  see consignment and customer arrangements for precious metals under item of this annual report on form k 
on march   we amended the amended credit facility the amended credit facility primarily to provide additional operating flexibility and to change pricing to more accurately reflect current market interest rates 
the primary effects of the amended credit facility are to increase the interest rates and commitment fees payable thereunder pursuant to a grid structure based on our leverage ratio  increase the maximum permitted leverage ratio and decrease the minimum permitted fixed charge coverage ratio  add a minimum quarterly ebitda requirement for fiscal year  restrict the company s ability to engage in acquisitions and make investments  limit the amount of cash and cash equivalent collateral the company is permitted to deliver to participants in our precious metals program to secure our obligations arising under the precious metals consignment agreements  require additional financial reporting by the company to the lenders  increase the amount of the annual excess cash flow required to be used to repay term loans  require application of the net proceeds of certain dispositions  but excluding the first million of such net proceeds  to be applied to repay debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility and term loans and to permanently reduce availability under the revolving loan facility on a dollar for dollar basis  provided that we are not required to reduce the commitments under the revolving credit facility to below million  eliminate our ability to request an increase of million in the revolving credit facility  add provisions governing the obligations of the company and the lenders if one or more lenders under the revolving credit facility fails to satisfy its funding obligations or otherwise becomes a defaulting lender  and restrict our ability to make payments with respect to our capital securities 
the amended credit facility effectively prohibits us from paying dividends on our common stock 

table of contents the specific covenants and related definitions can be found in the applicable debt agreements  each of which we have previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 
domestic receivable sales program we have an asset securitization program for substantially all of ferro s us trade accounts receivable 
this program accelerates cash collections at favorable financing costs and helps us manage the company s liquidity requirements 
we legally sell these trade accounts receivable to ffc  which finances its acquisition of trade receivable assets by issuing beneficial interests in securitizing the receivables to multi seller receivables securitization companies the conduits 
ffc and the conduits have no recourse to ferro s other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due as the assets transferred are legally isolated in accordance with the us bankruptcy laws 
ffc is a wholly owned subsidiary  which until december was a qualified special purpose entity qspe and  therefore  was not consolidated 
in december  we amended the program so that ffc is no longer a qspe  ffc is included in our consolidated financial statements  and this program is no longer accounted for as an off balance sheet arrangement 
in june  we amended the facility to reduce the program s size from million to million 
after reductions for non qualifying receivables  we had million at december   and million at february   available under this program 
at december  and february   ffc had not issued any beneficial interests in its trade accounts receivable  therefore there was no debt outstanding under the asset securitization program 
the company intends to renew or replace the asset securitization program prior to its scheduled expiration in june  however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
off balance sheet arrangements international receivables sales programs 
we maintain several international programs to sell trade accounts receivable  primarily without recourse 
the commitments supporting this program can be withdrawn at any time and totaled million at december  the amount of outstanding receivables sold under the international programs was million at december  consignment and customer arrangements for precious metals 
in the production of some of our products  we use precious metals  primarily silver for electronic materials products and gold for color and glass performance materials products 
we obtain most precious metals from financial institutions under consignment agreements generally referred to as our precious metals program 
the financial institutions retain ownership of the precious metals and charge us fees based on the amounts we consign 
these fees were million for at december   we had on hand million of precious metals  measured at fair value  owned by participants in our precious metals program 
we also process precious metals owned by our customers 
the consignment agreements involve short term commitments that typically mature within to days of each transaction and are typically renewed on an ongoing basis 
as a result  the company relies on the continued willingness of financial institutions to participate in these arrangements to maintain this source of liquidity 
during february and march  several participants in our precious metals program required ferro to deliver cash collateral to secure ferro s obligations arising under the consignment agreements 
ferro delivered the cash collateral to induce those financial institutions to continue participating in ferro s precious metals program 
if participants in our precious metals program require cash collateral to secure our obligations  ferro may choose to provide such collateral or purchase the precious metal outright as an alternative to continuing the consignment arrangements 
this would require us to borrow under our revolving credit facility or raise funds from other financing sources 
such borrowings would reduce our liquidity and increase our borrowing costs 
the amended credit facility prohibits ferro from delivering cash and cash equivalent collateral in excess of million to participants in our precious metals program 
accordingly  ferro would be required to purchase precious metals outright if these participants were unwilling to deliver metals in quantities sufficient to meet the company s operating requirements without exceeding the cash collateral limits set forth in the credit facility 
ferro is currently pursuing a variety of initiatives intended to reduce the amount of precious metals required to support our manufacturing operations and reduce our dependence on consignment agreements 

table of contents bank guarantees and standby letters of credit 
at december   the company had bank guarantees and standby letters of credit issued by financial institutions  which totaled million 
these agreements primarily relate to ferro s insurance programs and foreign tax payments 
other financing arrangement we maintain other lines of credit to provide global flexibility for ferro s short term liquidity requirements 
these facilities are uncommitted lines for our international operations and totaled million at december  the unused portions of these lines provided million of additional liquidity at december  liquidity requirement our liquidity requirements primarily include debt service  purchase commitments  working capital requirements  capital investments and postretirement obligations 
we expect to meet these requirements through cash provided by operating activities and availability under existing or replacement credit facilities or other financing arrangements 
ferro s level of debt and debt service requirements could have important consequences to its business operations and uses of cash flows 
the company s aggregate amount of obligations for the next five years and thereafter is set forth below thereafter totals dollars in thousands loans payable to banks convertible notes revolving credit facility term loan facility other long term notes obligations under capital leases obligations under operating leases purchase commitments obligations for interest costs  cash collateralization requirements  income taxes  and contributions to our post employment benefit plans are not included in the table above  but are discussed below 
cash required for interest costs in was million 
we expect that the amount for will be substantially higher due to the terms of our amended credit facility  but the actual amount depends on the underlying interest rates on our variable rate debt and our overall debt levels during the year 
as described in consignment and customer arrangements for precious metals above  we recently were required to provide cash collateral deposits to secure our obligations under our precious metals program 
we pay taxes as part of our normal operations as a profitable company 
the amount of taxes we pay depends on a variety of factors described in more detail in critical accounting policies below 
however  the principal factors are the level of our profitability and the countries in which we earn our taxable income 
we have paid and expect to continue to pay taxes for the foreseeable future 
under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin no 
 we anticipate that between and million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits may be reversed within the next months 
these liabilities relate to non us tax issues and are expected to reverse due to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations periods 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid or reversed in years beyond 
table of contents we expect to contribute approximately million in and million in to our post employment benefit plans 
we have not projected contributions past due to the current economic uncertainty and volatility in the global capital markets 
we determined these funding amounts based on the minimum contributions required under various applicable regulations in each respective country 
the pension protection act of was enacted in august while this act has had some effect on specific plan provisions in our us retirement programs  its primary effect has been to change the minimum funding requirements 
until final regulations are issued by the united states treasury department  the financial effect can only be estimated 
actual contributions also depend on the future funded status of the plans and on the amount of employee contributions 
critical accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes 
we consider the policies discussed below to be more critical than other policies because their application requires our most subjective or complex judgments 
these estimates and judgments arise because of the inherent uncertainty in predicting future events 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined utilizing the first in  first out fifo method 
we periodically evaluate the net realizable value of inventories based primarily upon their age  but also upon assumptions of future usage in production  customer demand and market conditions 
inventories have been reduced to the lower of cost or realizable value by allowances for slow moving or obsolete goods 
if actual circumstances are less favorable than those projected by management in its evaluation of the net realizable value of inventories  additional write downs may be required 
slow moving  excess or obsolete materials are specifically identified and may be physically separated from other materials  and we rework or dispose of these materials as time and manpower permit 
environmental liabilities our manufacturing facilities are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which they operate 
the costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations are significant and will continue for the foreseeable future 
we expense these recurring costs as they are incurred 
while these costs may increase in the future  they are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
we also accrue for environmental remediation costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount 
we determine the timing and amount of any liability based upon assumptions regarding future events 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and evolving technologies 
we adjust these liabilities periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
income taxes the breadth of our operations and complexity of income tax regulations require us to assess uncertainties and make judgments in estimating the ultimate amount of income taxes we will pay 
the final income taxes we pay are based upon many factors  including existing income tax laws and regulations  negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions  outcomes of tax litigation  and resolution of disputes arising from federal  state  and international income tax audits 
the resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to our income tax assets and liabilities in the future 
deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and we adjust our deferred income tax assets and liabilities for changes in income tax rates and income tax laws when changes are enacted 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets when it is more 
table of contents likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets 
the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income  our ability to carry back or carry forward net operating losses and credits to offset taxable income in a prior year  as well as successful implementation of various tax strategies to generate taxable income where net operating losses or credit carryforwards exist 
in evaluating our ability to realize the deferred income tax assets  we rely principally on the reversal of existing temporary differences  the availability of tax planning strategies  and forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results 
we earn a significant portion of our pre tax income outside the us many of these us tax jurisdictions have statutory income tax rates that are lower than that in the us because we carry a majority of our debt in the us  we also have significant cash needs in the us to service this debt 
as a result  it is necessary for us to perform significant tax and treasury planning and analysis to determine the best actions to achieve the goals of meeting our us cash needs  while also reducing our worldwide taxable income 
in this tax and treasury planning  we consider future taxable income in the us and non us jurisdictions  future cash needs in the non us  and the timing and amount of dividend repatriations 
our ability to balance future taxable income and cash flows between the us and foreign locations depends on various strategies  such as the charging of management fees for intercompany services  transfer pricing  intercompany royalties  intercompany sales of technologies and intellectual property  and choosing between allowable tax methods 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management s assessment of relevant risks  facts  and circumstances existing at that time 
we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured based on a more likely than not threshold and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on the tax return 
to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes  the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made 
we report tax related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense 
pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor defined benefit plans in the us and many countries outside the us  and we also sponsor retiree medical benefits for a segment of our salaried and hourly work force within the us the us pension plans represent approximately of pension plan assets  of benefit obligations and of net periodic pension cost 
the assumptions we use in actuarial calculations for these plans have a significant impact on benefit obligations and annual net periodic benefit costs 
we meet with our actuaries annually to discuss key economic assumptions used to develop these benefit obligations and net periodic costs 
in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
we determine the discount rate for the us pension and retiree medical plans based on a bond model 
using the pension plans projected cash flows  the bond model considers all possible bond portfolios that produce matching cash flows and selects the portfolio with the highest possible yield 
these portfolios are based on bonds with a quality rating of aa or better under either moody s or s p  but exclude certain bonds  such as callable bonds  bonds with small amounts outstanding  and bonds with unusually high or low yields 
the discount rates for the non us plans are based on a yield curve method  using aa rated bonds applicable in respective capital markets 
the duration of each plan s liabilities is used to select the rate from the yield curve corresponding to the same duration 
for the market related value of plan assets  we use fair value  rather than a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over several years 
we calculate the expected return on assets at the beginning of the year for defined benefit plans as the weighted average of the expected return for the target allocation of the principal asset classes held by each of the plans 
in determining the expected returns  we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long term rates of return 
our target asset allocation percentages are bonds and equity securities for us plans and bonds  equity securities  and 
table of contents other investments for non us plans 
in  our pension plan assets incurred losses of within us plans and within non us plans 
future actual pension expense will depend on future investment allocation and performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 
all other assumptions are reviewed periodically by our actuaries and us and may be adjusted based on current trends and expectations as well as past experience in the plans 
the following table provides the sensitivity of net annual periodic benefit costs for our pension plans  including a us nonqualified retirement plan  and the retiree medical plan to a basis point decrease in both the discount rate and asset return assumption basis point decrease basis point decrease in asset return in discount rate assumption dollars in thousands us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans total the following table provides the rates used in the assumptions and the changes between and change discount rate used to measure benefit cost us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans discount rate used to measure benefit obligations us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans expected return on plan assets us pension plans non us pension plans changes in the rates used in these assumptions reflect changes in the underlying bond and equity yields 
our overall net periodic benefit cost for all defined benefit plans decreased million to million in from million in in  service costs declined by million primarily because we froze pension benefit accruals and limited eligibility for retiree medical coverage for a limited number of us employees 
we also benefited by million from higher expected returns on plan assets primarily due to higher asset balances resulting from actual returns  company contribution  and currency effects in total exceeding benefit payments in another component of net periodic cost is the amortization of net actuarial unrecognized gains or losses 
these unrecognized gains or losses arise from differences between actual and assumed results and from changes in actuarial assumptions and are recognized in future periods 
in  we benefited by million from lower amortization of net actuarial losses  which declined in partially offsetting these benefits were higher interest costs of million driven by higher discount rates 
in  we recorded settlement losses of million related to retirements in the us  settlement gains of million related to retirements and terminations in mexico  italy and japan  a curtailment gain of million related to the closing of the rotterdam  netherlands  manufacturing facility  a settlement loss of million related to a required settlement of a plan in france  and special termination benefits of million related to terminations in the netherlands and indonesia 

table of contents for  we expect our overall net periodic benefit cost to increase to approximately million  an increase of million 
the substantial decline through december in the valuation of investments in the global capital markets increased our actuarial losses  which must be amortized in future periods 
at december   our unrecognized net actuarial losses totaled million  with an estimated million to be recognized in in addition  the amount of our expected return on plan assets for will be based on their lower valuation at december  we changed the measurement date for our us plans from september th to december st when we adopted fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
our non us plans already used a december st measurement date 
expense for the gap period from september th to december st was recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings as of january  restructuring and cost reduction programs during through  we developed and initiated several restructuring programs across a number of our business segments with the objectives of leveraging our global scale  realigning and lowering our cost structure  and optimizing capacity utilization 
the programs are primarily associated with north america and europe 
management continues to evaluate our businesses  and therefore  there may be supplemental provisions for new plan initiatives as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded  as payments are made  or actions are completed 
significant restructuring programs are described below 
certain programs that were initiated in and continued in in total  we recorded million  million and million of pre tax restructuring charges in  and  respectively 
these charges included both termination benefits and asset writedowns 
we estimated accruals for termination benefits based on various factors including length of service  contract provisions  local legal requirements  projected final service dates  and salary levels 
we also analyzed the carrying value of long lived assets and recorded estimated accelerated depreciation through the anticipated end of the useful life of the assets affected by the restructuring or recorded an asset impairment 
in all likelihood  this accelerated depreciation will result in reducing the net book value of those assets to zero at the date operations cease 
while we believe that changes to our estimates are unlikely  the accuracy of our estimates depends on the successful completion of numerous actions 
delays in moving continuing operations to other facilities or increased cash outlays will increase our restructuring costs to such an extent that it could have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
other events  for example  a delay in completion of construction of new facilities  may also delay the resulting cost savings 
revenue recognition we recognize sales typically when we ship goods to our customers and when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the selling price is fixed and determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and title and risk of loss has passed to our customers 
in order to ensure the revenue recognition in the proper period  we review material sales contracts for proper cut off based upon the business practices and legal requirements of each country 
for sales of products containing precious metals  we report gross revenues with a separate display of cost of sales to arrive at gross profit 
we record revenues this way because we act as the principal in the transactions we enter into and take title and the risks and rewards of ownership of the inventory we process  although the timing of when we take title to the inventory during the production process may vary 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and other non amortizing intangibles while goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives recorded on our balance sheet are no longer amortized  we review these assets for impairment each year on a measurement date of october st 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit associated with these assets using the weighted average of both the income approach and the market approach  which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of the reporting unit s fair value  unless facts and circumstances exist which indicate a more representative fair value 
the income approach uses projected cash flows attributable to the reporting unit over its useful life and allocates certain corporate expenses to the reporting unit in the process 
we use historical results and trends and our projections of market growth  internal sales efforts  input cost movements  and cost reduction opportunities to estimate future cash flows 
using a risk adjusted  weighted average cost of capital  we discount the cash flow projections to the measurement date 
the market approach estimates a price reasonably expected to be realized from the sale of similar businesses  including offers from potential acquirers 
if the fair value of any of the units were determined to be less than its carrying value  we would proceed to the second step and obtain comparable market values or independent appraisals of its assets to determine the amount of any impairment 
our estimates of fair value can be affected by a variety of factors 
reductions in actual or projected growth or profitability due to unfavorable market conditions in our business units  or significant increases in previous levels of capital spending  could lead to the impairment of any related goodwill 
additionally  an increase in inflation  interest rates or the risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital could also lead to a reduction in the value of one or more of our business units and therefore lead to the impairment of goodwill 
we believe the impairments of goodwill are our best estimates based upon the available evidence and analysis performed to date 
assessment of long lived assets our long lived assets include property  plant  equipment  and amortizing intangible assets 
we depreciate property  plant and equipment and amortize amortizable intangible assets on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we continually assess long lived assets for the appropriateness of their estimated useful lives 
when circumstances indicate that there has been a reduction in the economic useful life of an asset or an asset group  we revise our estimates 
we also review property  plant and equipment and intangibles for impairment at the asset group level whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use and eventual disposition are less than the asset group s recorded value 
in the event of impairment  we recognize a loss for the excess of the recorded value of the asset group over its fair value 
the long term nature of these assets requires that we estimate cash inflows and outflows for several years into the future and only take into consideration technological advances known at the time of impairment 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and precious metal prices 
the accounting for derivative financial instruments can be complex and require significant judgments 
generally  the derivative financial instruments that we use are not complex  and observable market based inputs are available to measure their fair value 
we do not engage in speculative transactions for trading purposes 
financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments  expose us to counterparty credit risk for non performance 
we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through minimum credit standards and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
we enter into these derivative financial instruments with major reputable multinational financial institutions 
accordingly  we do not anticipate counter party default 
we continuously evaluate the effectiveness of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges to ensure that they are highly effective 
in the event the hedge becomes ineffective  we discontinue hedge treatment 
except as noted below  we do not expect any changes in our risk policies or in the nature of the transactions we enter into to mitigate those risks 
our exposure to interest rate changes arises from our debt agreements with variable market interest rates 
we hedge a portion of this exposure by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
these swaps are settled quarterly in cash  and the net interest paid or received is effectively recognized as interest expense 
we mark these swaps to fair 
table of contents value and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other comprehensive income 
in  the fair value of the interest rate swaps was based on settlement prices provided by the counterparties 
beginning in in connection with the adoption of fas no 
 the fair value of the swaps is based on the present value of expected future cash flows  which reflects assumptions about current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the company that market participants would use in pricing the swaps 
we manage foreign currency risks in a wide variety of foreign currencies principally by entering into forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions arising from international trade 
our objective in entering into these forward contracts is to preserve the economic value of non functional currency cash flows 
our principal foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  the british pound sterling  the japanese yen  and the chinese yuan 
we mark these forward contracts to fair value based on market prices for comparable contracts and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other income or expense from foreign currency transactions 
we also manage a portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in the pricing of certain raw material commodities using swap arrangements that allow us to fix the price of the commodities for future purchases 
these swap arrangements are settled in cash at their maturities 
we mark these contracts to fair value based on market prices for comparable contracts and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other comprehensive income 
after the contracts mature and the materials are sold  the gains and losses are recognized as a part of cost of sales 
precious metals primarily silver  gold  platinum and palladium represent a significant portion of raw material costs in our electronic materials products 
we also use precious metals in our color and glass performance materials products 
when we enter into a fixed price sales contract at the customer s request to establish the price for the precious metals content of the order  we also enter into a forward purchase arrangement with a precious metals supplier to completely cover the value of the precious metals content 
prior to  most precious metal contracts were marked to fair value based on market prices for comparable contracts and the resulting gains or losses were recognized as miscellaneous income or expense  respectively 
in  most precious metal contracts were designated as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market 
we also purchase portions of our energy requirements  including natural gas and electricity  under fixed price contracts to reduce the volatility of cost changes 
our current energy contracts are designated as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to instruments that are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and costs of raw materials and energy 
our exposure to interest rate risk arises from our debt portfolio 
we manage this risk by controlling the mix of fixed versus variable rate debt after considering the interest rate environment and expected future cash flows 
to reduce our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt  we entered into interest rate swap agreements 
these swaps effectively convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
our overall objective is to limit variability in earnings  cash flows and overall borrowing costs caused by changes in interest rates  while preserving operating flexibility 
we operate internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
these transactions expose us to gains and losses arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled 
we manage this risk by entering into forward currency contracts that offset these gains and losses 
we are subject to cost changes with respect to our raw materials and energy purchases 
we attempt to mitigate raw materials cost increases through product reformulations  price increases  and other productivity improvements 
we hedge a portion of our exposure to changes in the pricing of certain raw material commodities through swap arrangements that allow us to fix the pricing of the commodities for future purchases 
we also enter into forward purchase arrangements with precious metals suppliers to completely cover the value of the precious metals content of fixed price sales contracts 
prior to  most precious metal contracts were marked to fair value  and the resulting gains or losses were recognized as miscellaneous income or expense  respectively 
in  most precious metal contracts were designated as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market  and had purchase commitments totaling million at december  in addition  we purchase portions of our natural gas and electricity requirements under fixed price contracts to reduce the volatility of these costs 
our current energy contracts are designated as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market
