this translates into an overall recycled newsprint average of 
during  all of mcclatchy s newspapers collected and recycled press waste  newspaper returns and printing plates 
competition the company s newspapers  direct marketing programs and sites compete for advertising revenues and readers time with television  radio  other internet sites  direct mail companies  free shoppers  suburban neighborhood and national newspapers and other publications  and billboard companies  among others 
in some of its markets  the company s newspapers also compete with other newspapers published in nearby cities and towns 
competition for advertising is generally based upon circulation levels  readership demographics  price  internet usage and advertiser results  while competition for circulation and readership is generally based upon the content  journalistic quality  service and the price of the newspaper 
the company s major daily newspapers lead their direct local newspaper competitors in both advertising linage and general circulation and readership in their respective markets  and its internet sites are generally the leading local sites in each of the company s major daily newspaper markets  based upon research conducted by the company and various independent sources 
nonetheless  the company has experienced a greater shift of advertising in the classified categories to online advertising and faces greater competition  particularly in the areas of employment  automotive and real estate advertising  by online competitors 
employees labor as of december   the company had approximately  full and part time employees equating to approximately  full time equivalent employees  of whom approximately were represented by unions 
most of the company s union represented employees are currently working under labor agreements expiring in various years through twenty of the company s daily papers have no unions 
while the company s newspapers have not had a strike for decades and do not currently anticipate a strike occurring  the company cannot preclude the possibility that a strike may occur at one or more of its newspapers when future negotiations occur 
the company believes that  in the event of a newspaper strike  it would be able to continue to publish and deliver to subscribers  a capability which is critical to retaining revenues from advertising and circulation  although there can be no assurance of this

the company has significant competition in the market for news and advertising which may reduce its advertising and circulation revenues in the future 
the company s primary source of revenue is advertising  followed by circulation revenues 
in recent years  the advertising industry generally has experienced a secular shift toward internet advertising and away from other traditional media 
in addition  the company s circulation has declined over the last two years  reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry including consumer migration toward the internet and other media for news and information 
the company has attempted to take advantage of the growth of online media and advertising by operating local internet sites in each of its daily newspaper markets  but faces increasing competition from other online sources for both advertising and circulation revenues 
this increased competition has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the company s business and financial results  including negatively impacting revenues and margins 
declines in general economic and business conditions subject the company to risks of declines in advertising revenues 
the united states economy is undergoing an extended period of economic uncertainty  which has caused  among other things  a general tightening in the credit markets  limited access to the credit market  lower levels of liquidity  increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy  lower consumer and business spending  and lower consumer net worth 
the resulting pressure on the labor and retail markets and the downturn in consumer confidence have weakened the economic climate in most of the markets in which the company does business and have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the company s advertising revenues 
classified advertising revenues have continued to decline since late and advertising results declined across the board in fiscal year a continued worsening in these economic conditions could further impact the company s business  reduce the company s advertising and other revenues and negatively impact the performance of its operations and its ability to meet debt covenants 
in addition  these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the company does business to satisfy their obligations to the company 
as a result  the company s results of operations may continue to be adversely affected 

table of contents the economic downturn and the decline in the price of the company s publicly traded stock may result in goodwill and masthead impairment charges 
the company recorded masthead impairment charges of million in and billion of goodwill and masthead impairment charges in reflecting the economic downturn and the decline in the price of the company s publicly traded common stock 
should general economic  market or business conditions continue to decline  and continue to have a negative impact on the company s stock price  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges 
the company may be de listed from the new york stock exchange nyse which could cause trading in its stock to become illiquid and negatively affect the price of the company s class a common stock 
mcclatchy was notified on february  by the new york stock exchange the nyse that it is not in compliance with the nyse s continued listing standards 
the nyse s notice indicated that on february   the company s average share price over the previous trading days was  which is below the nyse s quantitative listing standards 
such standards require nyse listed companies to maintain an average closing price of any listed security above per share for any consecutive thirty trading day period 
mcclatchy plans to notify the nyse of its intent to cure this deficiency and has six months from the date of the nyse notice to cure the non compliance 
however  should the company be unsuccessful in curing its non compliance or be de listed for other reasons  its stock could be traded in an over the counter or pink sheet basis which would be less liquid than a more established stock exchange 
such limited trading could negatively impact the share price of the company s class a common stock and lower the value of its equity 
on february   the nyse indicated that it had made an application to the securities and exchange commission to suspend the share price requirement initially through june  the company has billion in total consolidated debt which subjects the company to significant interest and credit risk 
as of december   the company had approximately billion in total consolidated debt outstanding 
this debt could increase the company s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 
debt service costs are subject to interest rate changes as well as any changes in the company s leverage ratio ratio of debt to operating cash flow as defined in the company s credit agreement with its banks 
higher leverage ratios could increase the level of debt service costs and also affect the company s future ability to refinance certain maturing debt  or the ultimate structure of such refinancing 
in addition  the company s credit ratings could affect its ability to refinance its debt on favorable terms 
on september   moody s investor services downgraded the company s corporate credit rating to b from ba 
on february   standard poor s lowered its corporate credit rating on the company to ccc from b  with a negative rating outlook 
the ratings on the company s bonds were lowered from ccc to ccc 
the company expects that over the next several years its primary use of cash flow from operations will be to reduce debt 
the national financial crisis and potential disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business  including the availability and cost of short term funds for liquidity requirements and could adversely affect our access to capital 
if internal funds are not available from our operations we may be required to rely on the banking and credit markets to meet our financial commitments and short term liquidity needs 
disruptions in the capital and credit markets  as have been experienced during  could adversely affect our ability to draw on our bank revolving credit facility 
our access to funds under that credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments 
those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time 
any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged 
although the company 
table of contents believes that its operating cash flow and current access to capital and credit markets  including the company s existing credit facility  will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair the company s liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing 
the company requires newsprint for operations and  therefore  its operating results may be adversely affected if the price of newsprint increases 
newsprint is the major component of our cost of raw materials 
newsprint accounted for of mcclatchy s operating expenses  excluding goodwill and masthead impairment  for fiscal accordingly  earnings are sensitive to changes in newsprint prices 
the company has not attempted to hedge fluctuations in the normal purchases of newsprint or enter into contracts with embedded derivatives for the purchase of newsprint 
if the price of newsprint increases materially  operating results could be adversely affected 
if newsprint suppliers experience labor unrest  transportation difficulties or other supply disruptions  the company s ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired and or the cost of the newsprint could increase  both of which would negatively affect its operating results 
a portion of the company s employees are members of unions and if the company experiences labor unrest  its ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired 
if mcclatchy experiences labor unrest  its ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired 
the results of future labor negotiations could harm the company s operating results 
the company s newspapers have not endured a labor strike for decades 
however  management cannot ensure that a strike will not occur at one or more of the company s newspapers in the future 
as of december   approximately of full time and part time employees were represented by unions 
most of the company s union represented employees are currently working under labor agreements  which expire at various times through mcclatchy faces collective bargaining upon the expirations of these labor agreements 
even if its newspapers do not suffer a labor strike  the company s operating results could be harmed if the results of labor negotiations restrict its ability to maximize the efficiency of its newspaper operations 
under the pension protection act ppa  the company will be required to make greater cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in the next several years than previously required  placing greater liquidity needs upon its operations 
the poor capital markets of that have affected all investments impacted the funds in our pension plans and they had poor returns in as a result of the lower assets  the projected benefit obligations of our qualified pension plans exceed plan assets by million as of the end of compared to an underfunded status of million at the end of the amount of our underfunded status will be positively impacted by the freezing of the pension plan by an as yet undetermined amount and we have not considered future earnings on plan assets 
nonetheless  the excess of obligations over pension assets is expected to give rise to required pension contributions over the next several years 
the ppa funding rules are likely to require the net liability at the end of to be funded with tax deductible contributions between and  with approximately to coming due in while legislation has recently been enacted to give some relief in funding and there may be more related legislation  the contributions may place additional strain on the company s liquidity needs 
the company has invested in certain internet ventures  but such ventures may not be as successful as expected which could adversely affect the results of operations of the company 
the company continues to evaluate its business and make strategic investments in digital ventures  either alone or with partners  to further its growth in its online businesses 
there can be no assurances that these investments or partnerships will result in growth in advertising or will produce equity income or capital gains in future years

the company s primary source of revenue is print and online advertising  which accounted for of the company s revenue for fiscal while percentages vary from year to year and from newspaper to newspaper  classified advertising has steadily decreased as a percentage of total advertising revenues primarily in the employment and real estate categories and to a lesser extent the automotive category 
classified advertising as a percentage of total advertising revenues has declined to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal  primarily as a result of the economic slowdown affecting classified advertising and the secular shift in advertising demand to online products 
while revenues from retail advertising carried as a part of newspapers run of press or rop advertising or in advertising inserts placed in newspapers preprint advertising has decreased year over year  retail advertising has steadily increased as a percentage of total advertising up to in compared to in fiscal and in fiscal national advertising as a percentage of total advertising revenue remained relatively similar year over year and contributed of total advertising revenue in fiscal direct marketing and other advertising made up the remainder of the company s advertising revenues in fiscal while included in the revenues above  all categories of online advertising are growing  with the exception of employment which has been negatively affected by the economic downturn 
online advertising revenues grew in fiscal and represented of total advertising revenues  up from in fiscal excluding employment online advertising revenues  online advertising grew in fiscal as compared to fiscal circulation revenues increased to of the company s newspaper revenues in fiscal from in fiscal most of the company s newspapers are delivered by independent contractors 
circulation revenues are recorded net of direct delivery costs 
see the following results of operations for a discussion of the company s revenue performance and contribution by category for fiscal  and critical accounting policies the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally 
table of contents accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
the most significant areas involving estimates and assumptions are revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible accounts  amortization and or impairment of goodwill and other intangibles  pension and post retirement expenses  insurance reserves  and the company s accounting for income taxes 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies  in particular  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues from advertising placed in a newspaper and or on a website over the advertising contract period or as services are delivered  as appropriate  and recognizes circulation revenues as newspapers are delivered over the applicable subscription term 
circulation revenues are recorded net of direct delivery costs 
other revenue is recognized when the related product or service has been delivered 
revenues are recorded net of estimated incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
revisions to these estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance account for estimated losses resulting from the risk its customers will not make required payments 
generally  the company uses the aging of accounts receivable  reserving for all accounts due days or longer  to establish allowances for losses on accounts receivable 
however  if the company becomes aware that the financial condition of a customer has deteriorated  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances are reserved 
acquisition accounting pursuant to emerging issues task force no 
 determination of the measurement date for the market price of acquirer securities issued in a purchase business combination  mcclatchy common stock issued on june  was valued based upon the average closing price of mcclatchy s common stock from march  through march  two business days before and after the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced  or per share 
as a result  the fair value of the million shares of mcclatchy s common stock issued in the acquisition of knight ridder  inc the acquisition was recorded at billion  which was included in the total acquisition purchase price of approximately billion 
the fair value of such shares declined to approximately billion as of the acquisition closing date june   however  the decline of million in valuation had no effect on the total acquisition purchase price recorded 
this difference is included in the allocation to goodwill in the allocation of the purchase price  and was written off in the goodwill impairment charges taken in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 business combinations  the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values as of june   the date of the acquisition 
goodwill and intangible impairment the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by sfas no 
 the company tests for goodwill annually at year end or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such indicators of impairment may include  but are not limited to  changes in business climate such as an economic downturn  significant operating cash flow declines related to its newspapers or a major change in the assessment of future operations of its newspapers  or a sustained decline in the company s stock price below the per share book value of stockholders equity 
due to the continuing challenging business conditions and the resulting 
table of contents weakness in the company s stock price  the company analyzed the carrying value of its net assets as of december  and as of september  and december  as a result impairment charges related to newspaper mastheads were recorded in fiscal and and related to goodwill in fiscal please see additional information in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
summary of approach and analysis of impairments the required two step approach to test for impairment under sfas requires the use of accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results 
because sfas requires that impairment testing be done at a reporting unit level  the company performs this testing at its newspaper operating segments which are considered reporting units under sfas no 

an impairment charge generally is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
in summary the company conducts its tests and considers the following factors the fair value of the company s reporting units is determined using a discounted cash flow model 
the projected cash flows are based on estimates of revenues  newsprint expenses and other cash costs 
while these estimates are always inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  the ability to project future operations and in particular advertising revenues has become more difficult due to the unprecedented declines in print advertising as discussed below 
the discount rate is determined using the company s weighted average cost of capital  adjusted for risks perceived by investors which are implicit in the company s publicly traded stock price 
the amount of a goodwill impairment charge requires management to allocate the fair value of the reporting units to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets  using its best judgments and estimates in valuing the reporting unit  to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
the resulting total fair value of the reporting units is then reconciled to the market capitalization of the company  giving effect to an appropriate control premium 
a goodwill impairment charge is recorded to the extent that the implied goodwill values are below the book value of goodwill for the reporting units 
management believes the lack of visibility in future revenue trends has affected investors view of the company s enterprise value as reflected in its stock price 
continued declines in the company s revenues  which are not offset by the company s cost restructuring efforts  will likely have an impact on the fair value of the company s reporting units as determined by the company s discounted cash flow analysis 
in addition  a sustained decline in the value of the company s stock price likely the result of declining revenues not sufficiently offset with cost savings would be considered an indicator of impairment  as discussed below 
a more comprehensive discussion of the factors that affected the impairment charges follows 
factors affecting fair value calculations for goodwill impairment fair value is determined using an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon future revenue  expenses and cash flows discounted to their present value 
the estimated future cash flows projected can vary within a range of outcomes depending on the assumptions and estimates used 
the estimates and judgments that most significantly affect the fair value calculation are assumptions related to revenue  and in particular  potential changes in future advertising including the impact of economic trends and the speed of conversion of advertising and readership to online products from traditional print products  trends in newsprint prices  and other operating expense items 
the following are trends considered by the company in developing assumptions and estimates for its discounted cash flow analysis beginning in mid  advertising declined as the real estate boom began to unwind and newspapers in the states that experienced the largest run up in real estate values experienced advertising revenue 
table of contents declines 
the real estate led downturn has subsequently spread to other sectors in the economy and across the nation 
as a result  advertising declined in the newspaper industry in and the decline worsened through the company s advertising revenues in were up but declined in both years pro forma for the acquisition of knight ridder and continued to decline in  when they were down from advertising has been moving to the internet  particularly in the employment category 
this shift in advertiser preferences accelerated as the economy slowed 
while much of this advertising was captured by newspapers websites  low barriers to entry and the searchable format of the internet gave rise to many more competitors online than in print  particularly in the classified advertising categories 
newsprint expense is the largest raw material input in the production of newspapers and has ranged from in to in of cash operating expenses for the company 
newsprint producers have consolidated and reduced capacity within the last year  and foreign demand of newsprint has risen  causing prices to begin to rise in late and continue to increase in however  newsprint usage is at historical lows due to declines in circulation and advertising  and to a lesser extent  to the migration of some readers and advertisers to the internet 
through most of  price increases have been offset by lower newsprint usage reflecting declines in print advertising and circulation and newspaper conservation efforts 
through and  the company has been in a process of downsizing its business as it has become a hybrid print and online news and information company  ultimately a smaller company than one primarily focused on print alone 
compensation expenses are the largest component of the company s expenses and management has reduced its workforce and restructured operations over time by using attrition  outsourcing and consolidating functions 
as revenue declines have accelerated  the pace of restructuring has also accelerated leading to restructuring initiatives announced by the company on june  and september  that included workforce reductions 
additional restructuring was announced on february  see recent events and trends below for expanded discussion of these efforts 
other expenses have also been targeted for reductions in the restructuring 
while the impact of these trends and anticipation of restructuring efforts were taken into account in the company s discounted cash flow models  assumptions about their impact on future operations are subject to variability and the ultimate outcome and specific advertising growth rates are highly subjective for individual newspapers 
fair value calculations by their nature require management to make assumptions about future operating results which can be difficult to predict with certainty 
they are influenced by management s views of future advertising trends in the industry  and in the markets in which it operates newspapers 
as discussed above  the variability in these trends and the difficulty in projecting advertising growth in particular in each newspaper market are impacted by the unprecedented declines in advertising 
discount rate considerations in developing an appropriate discount rate to apply in its discounted cash flow models the company develops an estimate of its weighted average cost of capital 
management also reviews the capital markets and considers in its estimates the level of interest rates and perceived market risk associated with media companies at large and the company s value specifically 
the ultimate discount rate selected is influenced by the reconciliation to current market capitalization 
the company also reviews the value of each newspaper as calculated in the discounted cash flow model at various discount rates in comparison to public and private market trading multiples for newspaper assets as a reasonableness check 
enterprise value and reconciliation to market capitalization the trends discussed above  along with general economic conditions  affect the market s perception of mcclatchy s enterprise value 
the sum of the fair values of the reporting units is compared to the company s 
table of contents current market capitalization based upon the recent stock market prices plus an estimated control premium  to determine the reasonableness of the fair values 
the estimated control premium is based in part upon multiples achieved in sales transactions of media companies with similar dual class stock structures as the company 
though there is a level of subjectivity and variability related to the assumptions in projecting future operating results  this process provides observable market input into and therefore influences the range of values ascribed to the reporting units 
masthead considerations newspaper mastheads newspaper titles and website domain names are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually at year end  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of each newspaper masthead with its carrying amount 
the company uses a relief from royalty approach which utilizes a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of each newspaper masthead 
management s judgments and estimates of future operating results in determining the reporting unit fair values are consistently applied to each newspaper in determining the fair value of each newspaper masthead 
the company performed impairment tests on newspaper mastheads as of december  and september and december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment charges taken 
other intangible assets considerations intangible assets subject to amortization primarily advertiser and subscriber lists are tested for recoverability whenever events or change in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of each asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of such asset group 
the company performed impairment tests on its long lived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization as of december  and september and december  no impairment loss was recognized on intangible assets subject to amortization 
pension and post retirement benefits the company has significant pension and post retirement benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including salary rate increases  discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in establishing these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit costs or credits may occur in the future because of changes resulting from fluctuations in the company s employee headcount and or changes in the various assumptions 
fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans requires recognition of the funded status of a pension plan difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation and the funded status of a post retirement plan difference between the plan assets at fair value and the accumulated benefit obligation  as an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
at december  net retirement obligations in excess of retirement plans assets were million 
this amount included million for non qualified plans that do not have assets 
obligations in excess of qualified plans netted to a million liability at december  at december  net retirement obligations in excess of retirement plans assets were million 
this amount included million for non qualified plans that do not have assets 
obligations in excess of qualified plans netted to a million liability at december  on february   the company announced a decision to freeze its defined benefit pension plans as of march  hence  employee service earned in the plans through march  will be accrued  but no future service will be accrued after this date 
see further discussion in recent events and trends section below 
the company used discount rates of to  assumed salary rate increases of to and an assumed long term return on assets of to calculate its retirement expenses in the expenses were 
table of contents also impacted by revaluing pension obligations in connection with plan curtailments as of june  and september  using applicable discount rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more in depth discussion of the company s policies in setting its key assumptions related to these obligations 
for fiscal a change in the weighted average rates exclusive of the impact of accounting for plan curtailments would have had the following impact on the company s net benefit cost a decrease of basis points in the long term rate of return would have increased the company s net benefit cost by approximately million  a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have increased the company s net benefit cost by approximately million  and an increase of basis points in the future compensation rate would have increased the company s net benefit cost by approximately million
