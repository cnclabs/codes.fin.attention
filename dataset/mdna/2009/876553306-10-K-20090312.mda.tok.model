critical accounting estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require that management make numerous estimates and assumptions 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions  impacting the company s reported results of operations and financial position 
certain accounting estimates  however  are considered to be critical in that i they are most important to the depiction of the financial condition and results of operations of the company and ii their application requires management s most subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
customer sales and discounts and allowances the company gives allowances and offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers that are accounted for as a reduction of sales 
the company records estimated reductions to sales for price promotion discounts at the time the product purchased by the independent sales distributor is sold to the customer distributor discounts at the time revenue is recognized coupon expense at the estimated redemption rate customer rebates at the time revenue is recognized cooperative advertising at the time the company s obligation to the customer is incurred product returns received from independent sales distributors price promotion discount expense is recorded when the related product being discounted is sold by the independent sales distributor to the customer 
the amount of the price promotion is captured when the independent sales distributor sells product to the customer 
the price promotion discount is based upon actual discounts per case using an approved price promotion calendar 
any increase or decrease in volume may result in variations to price discounts recorded each month 
independent sales distributors receive a purchase discount equal to a percentage of the wholesale price of product sold to customers  adjusted for price promotions and product returns 
direct customers receive a purchase discount equal to a percentage of the wholesale price of product received 
discounts to distributors and customers are based on agreed upon rates  and amounts vary based upon volume 
coupon expense estimates are calculated using the number of coupons dropped to consumers and the estimated redemption percentage 
the estimated redemption percentages are based on data obtained from the company s third party coupon processor  and its experience with similar coupon drops 
upon monthly receipt of the actual coupon redemption report  the coupon expense is updated based upon actual coupon activity as well as changes in the forecasted redemption percentage as estimated by the third party coupon processor 
estimates for customer rebates assume that customers will meet the required quantities to qualify for payment 
if the customers fall above or below the estimate as the year progresses  this could impact the estimate 
cooperative advertising expense is recorded based on the estimated advertising cost of the underlying program 
product returns are recorded as product is returned to the company 
at quarter and year end  an estimated reserve for product returns is recorded based upon sales in the last month of the quarter or year and historical return experience 
actual returns may vary from this estimate 
some customers take unauthorized deductions when they make payments to the company 
unauthorized deductions are taken by customers for various reasons  including  but not limited to missing or damaged product 
it is the company s policy to establish a reserve for each unauthorized deduction at the time it is taken by the customer 
the reserve is maintained until such time as the company can determine the validity of the deduction 
if it is ultimately determined after investigation that a deduction is not valid  the customer is charged back and the reserve is reversed 
since the company obtains updated information on every discount and allowance account each month  the risk that estimates are not properly recorded is generally limited to a percentage of one month s activity 
the average monthly amount of discounts and allowances was approximately million in historically  actual discounts and allowances have not varied significantly from estimates 
total discounts and allowances were of gross sales in this percentage is consistent with prior years and is a significant percentage of gross sales since all price discounts given to both independent sales distributors and third party distributors are reflected as reductions to gross sales 
provision for doubtful accounts the company aggressively pursues collection of accounts receivable balances 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers financial condition and makes quarterly estimates of its ability to collect its accounts receivable balances 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management specifically analyzes accounts receivable trends and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  levels of customer deductions  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a selling  general and administrative expense 
the allowance for doubtful accounts has three components 
the first component is a reserve against all accounts receivable balances based on the last five years of write off experience for the company 
the second component is for specific trade customer accounts receivable balances from customers whose ability to pay is in question  such as customers who file for bankruptcy while they have an outstanding balance due the company 
the third component is a reserve against any breached independent sales distributor accounts receivable balances that are not adequately covered by the independent sales distributor s equity in the route territory 
although the total allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the estimated risk for all customer balances  if any one of our top twenty customers accounts receivable balances became fully uncollectible  it would have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations and would negatively impact cash flow 
long lived asset impairment in accordance with sfas no  long lived assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in instances where the carrying amount may not be recoverable  the review for potential impairment utilizes estimates and assumptions of future cash flows directly related to the asset 
cash flow estimates are typically derived from the company s historical experience and internal business plans 
for assets where there is no plan for future use  the review for impairment includes estimates and assumptions of the fair market value of the asset  which is based on the best information available 
the company uses market prices  when available  and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
these assets are recorded at the lower of their book value or market value 
adverse changes in future market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of an affected asset 
for assets which are expected to be disposed of through abandonment before the end of their previously estimated useful life  depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the shortened useful life 
pension and postretirement plans accounting for pensions and postretirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding numerous factors  including discount rate  rate of return on plan assets  compensation increases  health care cost increases  and mortality and employee turnover 
a sensitivity analysis for pensions is included in note and a sensitivity analysis for postretirement benefits other than pensions is included in note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the company utilized the services of licensed independent actuaries to perform these required calculations to determine liability and expense in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in addition  the company may experience significant changes in its pension expense from year to year because of its election in to immediately recognize all pension gains and losses in excess of its pension corridor in the year that they occur 
for comparative purposes  this is relevant because most other public companies use an amortization method that allows recognition of pension gains and losses to be amortized over longer periods of time 
also  the final determination of the gains and losses that could potentially exceed the corridor is not known until the last day of the year  which makes it difficult to estimate 
the combination of low interest rates and low or negative rates of return on plan assets can cause higher levels of pension expense  conversely  high interest rates and high rates of return on assets could result in higher levels of pension income 
market conditions where interest rates and asset returns move inversely relative to each other  in most instances  cause the company to have pension expense or income within its allowable pension corridor 
actual results may differ from the company s assumptions and may impact the liability and expense amounts reported for pensions and postretirement benefits 
during  overall pension asset returns were well below the assumption 
in addition  the discount rate increased from at the end of to at the end of further  the other postretirement benefits opeb discount rate increased from at the end of to at the end of in  pension losses exceeded the pension corridor and the company recorded million in additional pension expense during the fourth quarter 
during  there was no gain or loss in excess of the pension corridor 
with the implementation of medicare part d in january  the company stopped providing medical benefits for most of its post retirees and began requiring incumbent retirees to pay age based rates for life insurance benefits in excess of  as a result of these benefit changes  the projected benefit obligation was re measured and in january the company recognized a reduction in its opeb liability of approximately million that is amortized over future periods 
in  the company recognized the amortization of this liability in a reduction of pre tax opeb of million 
in december of  the company made the decision to terminate its retiree medical benefit plan  which offered medical insurance to pre retirees at a subsidized rate 
the decision to terminate the plan was made prior to december  and the company has set the benefits cessation date as december  this plan amendment and curtailment resulted in the company recording million in income in the fourth quarter  which is reflected in the company s income from operations and has been recorded in compliance with fas employers accounting for pensions  fas employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  and fas employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
workers compensation expense accounting for workers compensation expense requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding numerous factors  including the ultimate severity of injuries  the timeliness of reporting injuries  and health care cost increases 
the company insures for workers compensation liabilities under a large deductible program where losses are incurred by the company up to certain specific and aggregate amounts 
accruals for claims under the large deductible insurance program are recorded as claims are incurred 
the company estimates the liability based on total incurred claims and paid claims  adjusted by loss development factors that account for the development of losses over time 
loss development factors are based on prior loss experience and on the age of incurred claims  and are reviewed by a third party claim loss specialist 
the company s estimated liability is the difference between the amounts we expect to pay and the amounts we have already paid for those years  adjusted for the limits on the aggregate amounts and discounted to present value 
the company evaluates the estimated liability on a continuing basis and adjusts it accordingly 
included in the estimate of liability is an estimate for expected changes in inflation and health care costs 
if there were to be an excessive number of workers compensation claims in a given accounting period and these actual results varied from the company s assumptions  these could have a material impact on our cash flow and consolidated statement of operations 
income tax valuation during the year  the company records income tax expense and liabilities based on estimates of book and tax income  and current tax rates 
these estimates could vary in the future due to uncertainties in company profits  new laws  new interpretations of existing laws  and rulings by taxing authorities 
differences between actual results and our assumptions  or changes in our assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
the company has recorded a deferred income tax asset for the benefit of federal and state income tax loss carryforwards nols 
these carryforwards expire in varying amounts between and realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
however  the amount realized could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are not achieved 
results of operations percentages may not calculate due to rounding 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationships to gross sales of certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations weeks ended weeks ended dec 
 dec 
 gross sales discounts and allowances net sales costs  expenses and other cost of sales depreciation selling  general administrative expenses other expense income  net interest expense income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss overview net loss for the fiscal year ended december  was million or per fully diluted share

net sales increased by in as compared to  which lagged gross sales growth due to higher product returns and promotional expense in the route markets 
during fiscal  route net sales increased and non route net sales increased compared to the prior year 
cost of sales cost of sales  excluding depreciation  increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in cost of sales resulted from a increase in variable manufacturing expenses 
the principal driver of the increase in variable manufacturing expenses was an million increase in certain key ingredient and packaging costs  including eggs  grains and oils  which was only partially offset by the impact of reduced sales volumes 
the increase in cost of sales in was also due to a million increase in fixed manufacturing costs 
the increase in fixed manufacturing costs was attributable to million in net cost associated with the company s pension corridor and other post retirement benefit plan termination  combined with million in benefit recorded in related to changes in the company s vacation benefit plans which did not recur in these increases were partially offset by lower compensation and other employee related costs  including a million reduction in incentive compensation 
during  the company recorded approximately million in pension costs resulting from the fact that losses in the company s defined benefit pension plan exceeded its pension corridor  which is equal to the greater of ten percent of the accumulated pension benefit obligation or ten percent of the market related value of plan assets 
approximately million or of the additional pension expense was recorded in fixed manufacturing costs  with the remainder or million recorded as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
during  the company terminated its pre retiree medical insurance plan  which offered medical insurance to retirees at subsidized rates 
as a result of this plan termination  the company recorded million in income in fiscal approximately million or of this benefit was recorded in fixed manufacturing costs  with the remainder or million recorded as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
depreciation depreciation expense increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the full year impact of the change in the useful lives of certain assets at the philadelphia operation which will not be relocated to the new facility  combined with higher depreciation resulting from investments in property and equipment related to the company s planned move to the new facility 
the company expects incremental depreciation resulting from the change in useful lives to remain at approximately million annually through june  when the new facility is expected to be fully operational 
gross margin for fiscal  gross margin declined percentage points to of net sales from of net sales in fiscal the gross margin decline was primarily driven by increased ingredient and packaging costs  the net effect of the pension corridor expense and the benefit associated with the change in the company s retiree medical benefit plan  and higher depreciation expense  which accounted for percentage points  percentage points and percentage points of the decline  respectively 
partially offsetting these declines was the benefit from higher selling prices 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal included in this change was approximately million in net cost associated with the company s pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
in addition  million of the year over year increase can be attributed to the benefit the company received in from changes to its vacation benefit plans and the sale of tax credits which did not recur in fiscal these increases were partially offset by lower compensation and other employee related costs  including a million reduction in incentive compensation expense 
other income expense for fiscal the company had other expense  net of million as compared to other income  net of million in fiscal this change was due to million in severance costs primarily related to the company s planned move to its new bakery beginning at the end of interest interest expense increased million to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher deferred financing fee amortization related to the company s new debt facilities as well as higher debt levels resulting from investments in equipment for the company s new manufacturing and distribution facility
