actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations set forth below  and  in particular  those in the section entitled risk factors in part i  item a of the annual report on form k included elsewhere herein 
we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or changes to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances 
we wish to caution readers that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
in light of the uncertainty of the economy generally  and the technology and storage segments specifically  it is difficult to determine if past experience is a good guide to the future and makes it impossible to determine if markets will grow or shrink in the short term 
recent disruptions in world credit and equity markets and the resulting economic uncertainty for our customers and the storage networking market as a whole has resulted in a downturn in information technology spending that has and could continue to adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
furthermore  the effect of any actual or potential unsolicited offers to acquire us may have an adverse effect on our operations 
as a result of this uncertainty  we are unable to predict with any accuracy what future results might be 
other factors affecting these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the following slower than expected growth of the storage networking market or the failure of our original equipment manufacturer oem customers to successfully incorporate our products into their systems  our dependence on a limited number of customers and the effects of the loss of  or decrease or delays in orders by  any such customers  or the failure of such customers to make payments  the emergence of new or stronger competitors as a result of consolidation movements in the market  the timing and market acceptance of our or our oem customers new or enhanced products  the variability in the level of our backlog and the variable and seasonal procurement patterns of our customers  impairment charges  including but not limited to goodwill and intangible assets  changes in tax rates or legislation  the effects of terrorist activities  natural disasters and any resulting political or economic instability  the highly competitive nature of the markets for our products as well as pricing pressures that may result from such competitive conditions  the effect of rapid migration of customers towards newer  lower cost product platforms  possible transitions from board or box level to application specific computer chip solutions for selected applications  a shift in unit product mix from higher end to lower end or mezzanine card products  a decrease in the average unit selling prices or an increase in the manufactured cost of our products  delays in product development  our reliance on third party suppliers and subcontractors for components and assembly  any inadequacy of our intellectual property protection or the potential for third party claims of infringement  our ability to attract and retain key technical personnel  our ability to benefit from our research and development activities  our dependence on international sales and internationally produced products  the effect of acquisitions  changes in accounting standards  and the potential effects of global warming and any resulting regulatory changes on our business

net revenues for fiscal decreased approximately million  or  to approximately million  compared to approximately million in fiscal we believe the decrease in net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a global economic slowdown that has resulted in decreased spending in general  and in the technology sector specifically 
net revenues by product line from a product line perspective  net revenues generated from our hsps for fiscal years and represented the majority of our net revenues 
our net revenues by product line were as follows net revenues by product line percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease change dollars in thousands host server products embedded storage products other total net revenues

net revenues by major customers in addition to direct sales  some of our larger oem customers purchase or market products indirectly through distributors  resellers or other third parties 
if these indirect sales are purchases of customer specific models  we are able to track these sales 
however  if these indirect sales are purchases of our standard models  we are not able to distinguish them by oem customer

net revenues by sales channel were as follows net revenues by sales channel percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease change dollars in thousands oem distribution other total net revenues we believe that our net revenues are being generated primarily as a result of product certifications and qualifications with our oem customers  which take products directly and indirectly through distribution and contract manufacturers 
we view product certifications and qualifications as an important indicator of future revenue opportunities and growth for the company 
however  product certifications and qualifications do not necessarily ensure continued market acceptance of our products by our oem customers 
it is also very difficult to determine the future impact  if any  of product certifications and qualifications on our revenues 
net revenues by geographic territory for fiscal  united states net revenues decreased by approximately million to million from million in fiscal for fiscal  international net revenues asia pacific  europe  middle east  africa and rest of the world decreased by approximately million to million from million in fiscal our united states and international net revenues based on billed to location were as follows net domestic and international revenues percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease change dollars in thousands united states asia pacific europe  middle east  africa and rest of the world total net revenues we believe the decrease  as a percentage of net revenues  in united states net revenues and international net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in products being sourced by our customers to locations outside of the united states combined with a global economic slowdown that has resulted in decreased spending in general  and in the technology sector specifically

the decrease in amortization of technology intangible assets was primarily due to various core and developed technology intangible assets from prior acquisitions being fully amortized 
approximately million and million of share based compensation expense were included in cost of sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
gross margin decreased during fiscal primarily due to the loss of efficiencies resulting from lower manufacturing volume combined with a decline in average sales prices

critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of net revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties 
changes in judgments and uncertainties could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies and require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  warranty  allowance for doubtful accounts  intangibles and other long lived assets  inventories  goodwill  income taxes  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment when title and risk of loss have passed  evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collectibility has been reasonably assured basic revenue recognition criteria 
we make certain sales through two tier distribution channels and have various distribution agreements with selected distributors and master value added resellers collectively  the distributors 
these distribution agreements may be terminated upon written notice by either party 
additionally  these distributors are generally given privileges to return a portion of inventory and to participate in price protection and cooperative marketing programs 
therefore  we recognize revenue on our standard products sold to our distributors based on data received from the distributors which management uses to approximate the point that these products have been resold by the distributors 
oem specific models sold to our distributors are governed under the related oem agreements rather than under these distribution agreements 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment for oem specific products shipped to the distributors when the basic revenue recognition criteria have been met 
additionally  we maintain accruals and allowances for price protection and various other marketing programs 
we account for these incentive programs in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
accordingly  we classify the costs of these programs based on the benefit received  if applicable  as a reduction of revenue  a cost of sale  or an operating expense 

table of contents warranty 
we provide a warranty of between one and five years on our products 
we record a provision for estimated warranty related costs at the time of sale based on historical product return rates and management s estimates of expected future costs to fulfill our warranty obligations 
we evaluate our ongoing warranty obligation on a quarterly basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write offs as a percentage of net revenues and management s review of outstanding accounts receivable 
amounts due from customers are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when management believes that collectibility of the amount is unlikely 
although we have not historically experienced significant losses on accounts receivable  our accounts receivable are concentrated with a small number of customers 
consequently  any write off associated with one of these customers could have a significant impact on our allowance for doubtful accounts and results of operations 
intangible assets and other long lived assets 
intangible assets resulting from acquisitions are carried at cost less accumulated amortization  impairment charges  and deferred compensation adjustments  if any 
for assets with determinable useful lives  amortization is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the respective intangible assets  ranging from four to seven years 
we assess whether our long lived assets  including intangible assets  should be tested for recoverability at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on fair value  which is determined using projected discounted future operating cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we use a standard cost system for purposes of determining cost 
the standards are adjusted periodically to represent actual cost 
we regularly compare forecasted demand and the composition of the forecast against inventory on hand and open purchase commitments in an effort to ensure the carrying value of inventory does not exceed net realizable value 
accordingly  we may have to record reductions to the carrying value of excess and obsolete inventory if forecasted demand decreases 
goodwill 
we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
management considers our business as a whole to be its reporting unit for purposes of testing for impairment 
this impairment test is performed annually during the fiscal fourth quarter 
a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit including a reasonable control premium  if needed with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the global economic slowdown has resulted in decreased spending in general  and in the technology sector specifically 
during the three months ended march   the company s market capitalization was below the carrying value of stockholders equity  an indicator that our goodwill may be impaired 
however  subsequent to march   our stock price recovered resulting in a market capitalization higher than the carrying value of stockholders equity 
consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 the company performed an interim assessment to determine if a triggering event had occurred since its last interim assessment related to the fiscal quarter ended december  this analysis considered both external and company specific factors and resulted in a conclusion that is was not more likely than not that goodwill was impaired as of march  during the annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company again compared the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value and determined that there was no impairment since the fair value based on the quoted market price of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
however  it is considered at least reasonably possible that the company s determination that goodwill is not impaired could change in the near term should the global economic slowdown continue or accelerate 

table of contents income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
tax positions that meet a more likely than not recognition threshold are recognized in the financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to complex tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment  and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based awards to employees and non employees using the fair value method as required by sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we used the modified prospective transition method when we adopted sfas no 
r in fiscal which provides for only the current and future period stock based awards to be measured and recognized at fair value 
stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the fair value of each unvested stock award or unvested stock unit is determined based on the closing price of our common stock at grant date 
for stock options  the measurement of stock based compensation cost is based on several criteria including  but not limited to  the valuation model used and associated input factors such as expected term of the award  stock price volatility  dividend rate  risk free interest rate  and award forfeiture rate 
the input factors to use in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment 
if there is a difference between the forfeiture assumptions used in determining stock based compensation costs and the actual forfeitures  which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining stock based compensation costs 
these changes may materially impact our results of operations in the period such changes are made 
see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein for additional information and related disclosures 
litigation costs 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
legal and other litigation related costs are recognized as the services are provided 
we record insurance recoveries for litigation costs which for which both conditions are met i the recovery is probable and ii collectability is reasonably assured 
the insurance recoveries recorded are only to the extent the litigation costs have been incurred and recognized in the financial statements  however  it is reasonably possible that the actual recovery may be significantly different from our estimates 
there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot provide assurance that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate sensitivity our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to their short terms to maturity 
as of june   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value

we have the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity 
we did not hold any auction rate securities or direct investments in mortgage backed securities as of june  the fair market value of our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and would decline in value if market interest rates increased 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels existing as of june   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
however  if interest rates decreased and securities within our portfolio were re invested in securities with lower interest rates  interest income would decrease in the future
