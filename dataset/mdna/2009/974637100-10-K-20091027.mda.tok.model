item a 
risk factors the following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face  but represent some of the most significant risk factors that we believe may adversely affect the rv industry and our business  operations or financial position 
interest rates and credit availability our business is affected by the availability and terms of the financing to dealers 
generally  recreation vehicle dealers finance their purchases of inventory with financing provided by lending institutions 
the decrease in the availability of this type of wholesale financing has prevented many dealers from carrying adequate levels of inventory  which limits product offerings and leads to reduced demand 
two financial flooring institutions held percent of our total financed dealer inventory dollars that were outstanding at august  our business is also affected by the availability and terms of financing to retail purchasers 
customers purchasing a motor home may elect to finance their purchase through the dealership or a financial institution of their choice 
substantial increases in interest rates and decreases in the general availability of credit have also had an adverse impact upon our business and results of operations in the past and may continue to do so in the future 
in particular  the current credit availability crisis has had and may continue to have a significant impact on our business 
general economic conditions and certain other external factors companies within the recreation vehicle industry are subject to volatility in operating results due primarily to general economic conditions 
specific factors affecting the recreation vehicle industry include overall consumer confidence and the level of discretionary consumer spending  employment trends  the adverse impact of global tensions on consumer spending and travel related activities  and adverse impact on margins of increases in raw material costs which we are unable to pass on to customers without negatively affecting sales 
maintaining adequate liquidity and capital resources although we have historically generated revenues from our operations to pay operating expenses  make capital expenditures  buy back stock and pay cash dividends  our ability to continue to meet our cash requirements over the long term may be substantially more difficult 
as a result of the financial crisis and the global recession  our revenues generated from motor home sales have been significantly reduced and our ability to liquidate our auction rate securities investments has been limited  further constraining our liquidity and capital resources 
we have taken a number of steps  as discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analysis of financial condition  liquidity and resources below  to increase our cash position and ensure adequate liquidity 
however  the continuation of reduced demand for our products could weaken the company s liquidity position and materially adversely affect net revenues available for the company s anticipated cash needs 
to the extent the initiatives we have undertaken are not successful or we are unable to successfully implement other alternative actions  our ability to cover both short term and long term operation requirements would be significantly adversely affected 

table of contents cyclicality and seasonality the recreation vehicle industry has been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand  reflecting prevailing economic and demographic conditions  which affect disposable income for leisure time activities 
consequently  the results for any prior period may not be indicative of results for any future period 
seasonal factors  over which we have no control  also have an effect on the demand for our products 
demand in the recreation vehicle industry generally declines over the winter season  while sales are generally highest during the spring and summer months 
also  unusually severe weather conditions in some markets may impact demand 
competition the market for recreation vehicles is very competitive 
competition in this industry is based upon price  design  value  quality and service 
there can be no assurance that existing or new competitors will not develop products that are superior to our recreation vehicles or that achieve better consumer acceptance  thereby adversely affecting market share  sales volume and profit margins 
potential repurchase liabilities in accordance with customary practice in the recreation vehicle industry  we enter into formal repurchase agreements with lending institutions pursuant to which we agree  in the event of a default by an independent retailer in its obligation to a lender and repossession of the unit s by the lending institution  we will repurchase units at declining prices over the term of the agreements  which can last up to months 
the difference between the gross repurchase price and the price at which the repurchased product can then be resold  which is typically at a discount to the gross repurchase price  represents a potential expense to us 
our maximum potential exposure under these formal repurchase agreements was approximately million at august in certain instances  we also repurchase inventory from our dealers due to state law or regulatory requirements that govern voluntary or involuntary terminations 
incremental repurchase exposure beyond repurchase agreements was approximately million at august  prior to fiscal  our losses associated with repurchases have not been material 
however  the substantial decrease in retail demand for recreation vehicles in the past months and tightened credit standards by lenders resulted in a significant increase in defaults by our dealers 
if we are obligated to repurchase a larger number of motor homes in the future  this would increase our costs and could be material 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fuel availability and prices gasoline or diesel fuel is required for the operation of motorized recreation vehicles 
there can be no assurance that the supply of these petroleum products will continue uninterrupted or that the price or tax on these petroleum products will not significantly increase in the future 
fuel shortages and substantial increases in fuel prices have had a material adverse effect on the recreation vehicle industry as a whole in the past and could have a material adverse effect on us in the future 
dependence on chassis suppliers most rv components are readily available from numerous sources 
however  decisions by suppliers to decrease production  utilize production internally or shortages  production delays or work stoppages by the employees of such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce motor homes and ultimately  on the results of operations 
a few components are produced by only a small group of quality suppliers that have the capacity to supply large quantities on a national basis 
this is especially true in the case of motor home chassis where ford motor company  freightliner custom chassis corporation  workhorse custom chassis and chrysler motors llc are our major suppliers 
our relationship with our chassis suppliers is similar to our other supplier relationships in that no special contractual commitments are engaged in by either party 
historically  chassis suppliers resort to an industry wide allocation system during periods when supply is restricted 
these allocations have been based on the volume of chassis previously purchased 
sales of motor homes rely on chassis and are affected accordingly 
if economic conditions improve and dealers begin to replenish their inventory  there may be a shortage of chassis for a period of time  which would adversely affect our production capacity and results of operations 

table of contents warranty claims we receive warranty claims from our dealers in the ordinary course of our business 
although we maintain reserves for such claims  which to date have been adequate  there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate 
a significant increase in warranty claims exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition to the costs associated with the contractual warranty coverage provided on our motor homes  we also occasionally incur costs as a result of additional service actions not covered by our warranties  including product recalls and customer satisfaction actions 
although we estimate and reserve for the cost of these service actions  there can be no assurance that expense levels will remain at current levels or such reserves will continue to be adequate 
product liability we are involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business  including a variety of warranty  lemon law and product liability claims typical in the recreation vehicle industry 
we have an insurance policy covering product liability  however  we are self insured for a portion of product liability claims 
self insurance retention liability for at least the past five fiscal years was million per occurrence and million in aggregate per policy year 
in the event that the annual aggregate of the self insured retention is exhausted by payment of claims and defense expenses  a deductible of million  excluding defense expenses  is applicable to each claim covered under this insurance policy 
we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claims against us  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if these claims rise to a level of frequency or size that are significantly higher than similar claims made against our competitors  our reputation and business may be harmed 
government regulation we are subject to numerous federal  state and local regulations governing the manufacture and sale of our products  including the provisions of the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act motor vehicle act  and the safety standards for recreation vehicles and components which have been established under the motor vehicle act by the department of transportation 
the motor vehicle act authorizes the national highway traffic safety administration to require a manufacturer to recall and repair vehicles which contain certain hazards or defects 
any recalls of our vehicles  voluntary or involuntary  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we are also subject to federal and numerous state consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations relating to the sale  transportation and marketing of motor vehicles  including so called lemon laws 
federal and state laws and regulations also impose upon vehicle operators various restrictions on the weight  length and width of motor vehicles  including motor homes that may be operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways 
certain jurisdictions also prohibit the sale of vehicles exceeding length restrictions 
finally  federal and state authorities also have various environmental control standards relating to air  water  noise pollution and hazardous waste generation and disposal which affect us and our operations 
failure to comply with any of the foregoing laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview winnebago industries  inc is the leading us manufacturer of motor homes with a proud history of manufacturing recreation vehicles for more than years 
our strategy is to manufacture quality motor homes in a profitable manner 
we produce all of our motor homes in highly vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in the state of iowa 
we distribute our products through independent dealers throughout the united states and canada  who then retail the products to the end consumer 
we have led the industry with the highest market share in the us of class a and c motor homes combined for the past eight calendar years and in calendar through august  we began producing class b motor homes in february and in calendar year through august   we hold the number three us position in retail unit market share 
see our us retail unit market share for all categories in the following table winnebago industries us retail market share calendar year through august  calendar year class a gas class a diesel total class a class c total class a and c class b as reported by statistical surveys 
company and business outlook the rv industry saw substantial reductions in wholesale motor home shipments down nearly percent and retail registrations down nearly percent during calendar as compared to the trend has worsened thus far in calendar  with motor home shipments down nearly percent and retail registrations down over percent  as detailed in the table below industry wholesale shipments calendar year industry retail registration calendar year in units decrease of decrease decrease of decrease first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in units decrease of decrease decrease of decrease first quarter second quarter july august as reported by rvia class a and c wholesale shipments  rounded to the nearest hundred 
as reported by statistical surveys class a and c retail registrations  rounded to the nearest hundred 
the motorized market has been significantly impacted by highly unstable market conditions 
the tightening of the wholesale and retail credit markets  low consumer confidence  the effect of the global recession and uncertainty related to fuel prices placed pressure on retail sales and as a result  our dealers have significantly reduced their inventory levels 
dealers continue to sell older model year units and during most of fiscal  they were not reordering inventory on a one for one basis  which negatively affected shipments and backlog 
the decline in wholesale and retail demand has directly impacted our gross margins as we have produced and delivered far fewer units in fiscal and we have also had to increase our discounts to meet competitive pricing and provide retail incentives to help dealers move inventory 

table of contents order backlog for our motor homes was as follows as of in units august  product mix august  product mix increase decrease change class a gas class a diesel total class a class b class c total backlog total approximate revenue dollars in thousands dealer inventory units we include in our backlog all accepted purchase orders from dealers to be shipped within the next six months 
orders in backlog can be canceled or postponed at the option of the dealer at any time without penalty and  therefore  backlog may not necessarily be an accurate measure of future sales 
as noted above  our dealer inventories were nearly percent lower than last year 
we attribute the growth in our backlog to the very low level of dealer inventories and the strong acceptance of our product lineup 
this increase may be a sign that the replenishment process is now beginning 
as wholesale and retail credit availability and consumer confidence improve  we expect to see an increase in motor home demand as dealers will again have the ability to order units to maintain their inventory levels after an extended period of inventory reduction 
a longer term positive outlook for the recreation vehicle industry is supported by favorable demographics as baby boomers reach the age group that has historically accounted for the bulk of retail rv sales

net revenues for the year ended august  decreased million  or percent  due to the following volume decline the primary reason for the net revenue decline was due to unit deliveries decreasing by percent 
pricing and mix our motor home average selling price asp  net of discounts  decreased percent 
the decrease in our asp was due to an increase of product discounts we offered at the wholesale level and a shift in mix to lower priced products  partially offset by the increase in pricing 
our sales mix for the year was more heavily weighted to lower priced products as percent of our volume in fiscal was class b and c products as compared to a percent mix of class b and c products in fiscal promotional incentives our retail and other incentives increased percent as a percentage of net revenues due to increased retail promotional activity on significantly lower revenues 
we used retail incentive programs to help stimulate dealer retail traffic and the programs have had a substantial impact in reducing the dealer inventory level  as our dealer inventory in units is down percent at august  compared to august  repurchases our losses on repurchases of motor homes during fiscal were significantly higher than previous years as a result of the dramatic decline in the motor home market 
as a percentage of net revenues  repurchase expense was percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal other revenue revenues for motor home parts and services and other manufactured products decreased by percent 
cost of goods sold was million  or percent  of net revenues for fiscal compared to million  or percent  of net revenues for fiscal the change in our variable costs materials  direct labor  variable overhead  delivery expense and warranty comprise million of the million decrease  which was primarily caused by decreased sales volume 
material  labor and variable overhead  as a percent of net revenues  increased to percent from percent in fiscal from fiscal the percent increase was primarily caused by increased discounting and promotional incentives in fiscal to promote sales in a difficult motor home market 
delivery expenses and warranty costs in relation to net sales remained consistent in fiscal to fiscal our variable costs were favorably impacted by million  or percent  of net revenues in fiscal due to the reduction of the last in  first out lifo inventory liquidation  as compared to lifo expense in fiscal of million  or percent  of net revenues 
fixed overhead  which consists primarily of manufacturing support labor  depreciation and facility costs  increased to percent of net revenues in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal this difference was due primarily to low absorption of fixed costs as a result of significantly lower production volume 
all factors considered  gross deficit profit decreased from a gross profit of percent of net revenues during fiscal to a gross deficit of percent of net revenues during fiscal selling expenses decreased million  or percent  during the fiscal year ended august  however  as a percent of net revenues  selling expenses were percent during fiscal compared to percent for fiscal the decrease in dollars was due primarily to reductions in advertising expenses of million  labor related expenses of million as a result of reduced head count  salesmen incentives of  travel and meeting expenses of  and stock compensation of  as we did not grant stock awards during fiscal the increase in percentage of net revenues was caused by the significant difference in revenue levels between the two fiscal periods 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or percent  during the fiscal year ended august  however  as a percent of net revenues  general and administrative expenses were percent during fiscal compared to percent for fiscal the decrease in dollars was due primarily to reductions in stock compensation of million  as we did not grant stock awards during fiscal  labor related expenses of million as a result of reduced head count  legal expenses of million and lower depreciation expense of  the increase in percentage of net revenues was caused by the significant difference in revenue levels between the two fiscal periods 

table of contents asset impairment expenses of  were recorded in fiscal was a result of the decision to close the hampton  iowa fiberglass manufacturing facility 
financial income decreased million  or percent  for the fiscal year ended august  the decrease in financial income was primarily due to a decrease in the average yield and to a lesser extent  due to a decrease in average investment balances 
the overall effective income tax rate for fiscal was an expense of percent compared to a benefit of percent for fiscal the following table breaks down the two aforementioned tax rates year ended august  august  dollars in thousands amount effective rate amount effective rate tax benefit on current operations valuation allowance settlements of uncertain tax positions other total provision benefit for taxes fiscal year ended august  contained weeks  fiscal year ended august  contained weeks 
tax benefit on current operations 
at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  our ability to claim refunds of taxes previously paid was exhausted due to the size of our fiscal operating losses 
thus  of the million tax benefit on current operations  we have established an associated tax refund receivable of million 
the effective tax benefit rate of percent as compared to a benefit rate of percent is primarily attributable to the fiscal pre tax loss of million versus the fiscal pre tax loss of million 
included within the fiscal pre tax loss of million was million of financial income  which was primarily tax free income from investments in municipal and student loan related securities and appreciation in company owned life insurance coli  and resulted in an increase to the tax benefit of million and increased the tax benefit rate by percent 
in fiscal  tax free investment income resulted in a tax benefit of million a percent increase in the effective benefit rate 
valuation allowance 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash charge of million to establish a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not standard 
in making such assessments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook 
under that standard  our three year historical cumulative loss was a significant negative factor 
this loss  combined with uncertain near term market and economic conditions  reduced our ability to rely on our projections of any future taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate 
accordingly  we concluded that  based on sfas no 
guidelines  a full valuation allowance should now be established 
we will continue to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realizable and our valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of  to establish a valuation allowance on tax credits that were determined not to be recoverable prior to the tax credits expiring 
settlements 
during fiscal  we recognized a tax benefit of  as a result of favorable settlements with various taxing jurisdictions  which increased the tax benefit rate by percent 
in fiscal  we had an effective tax benefit rate of percent  which was based on the favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions with various taxing jurisdictions 
the original unrecognized tax benefit associated with these positions was million  of which million was paid in cash per the settlement 
the balance of this reserve  net of the related deferred taxes  resulted in a million increase in tax benefit

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of  to establish a valuation allowance on certain state tax credits that were determined not likely to be recoverable prior to the tax credits expiring 
net income decreased by percent and income per diluted share decreased by percent when comparing fiscal to fiscal analysis of financial condition  liquidity and resources in most fiscal years  we generated cash from operations  which enabled us to meet our working capital needs and make appropriate investments in manufacturing equipment and facilities  as well as pay cash dividends and repurchase stock 
working capital at august  and august  was million and million  respectively  a decrease of million 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million as of august  and august   respectively 
short term and long term investments net of temporary impairments totaled million as of august  and million as of august  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
due to extremely challenging market conditions which have resulted in a severe decline in our revenues in fiscal  maintaining liquidity and conserving capital have been the primary goals of management in order to enhance our financial flexibility 
during fiscal  we increased our cash position by million despite a pre tax loss of million 
multiple steps were taken during fiscal to conserve capital and maintain liquidity  as follows inventories were significantly reduced during the fiscal year which resulted in an improvement of working capital of approximately million 
we elected to participate in a no net cost loan program and borrowed million through ubs during the second quarter  secured by a portion of the ars owned by us and held by ubs 
we suspended cash dividend payments starting in the second quarter of fiscal this suspension reduces the amount of cash which we would have used by approximately million for fiscal as of august   we had million of cash 
due to the ability to carryback a large portion of our tax loss in fiscal to prior years  we expect to receive a federal tax refund in excess of million in the second quarter of fiscal we also have the ability to put the remaining million of unencumbered ars held by ubs to ubs in the fourth quarter of fiscal in aggregate  this provides liquidity of approximately million 
when considering all of these factors  we expect to have sufficient liquidity for at least the next months  even at the current depressed sales levels 
in addition  we placed multiple assets for sale  including our plane and two manufacturing facilities 
total listing price of these assets is in excess of million 
we also have in place a new million revolving credit facility  as described in further detail in note  that allows us to borrow up to million without financial covenant restrictions if there is adequate asset coverage 
subject to certain provisions  the facility also includes an option that can be exercised to increase the facility size up to million 
this potential additional borrowing capacity may be beneficial to us if inventory levels need to substantially increase rapidly as a result of product demand 
we also have taken significant actions over the past year to reduce our fixed cost structure and mitigate against certain rising costs  which resulted in reductions of approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal specifically  actions taken include compensation related expenses total head count was reduced by approximately percent in addition to the percent reductions in fiscal  compensation reductions ranging from to percent for salaried employees including executive officers was made mid year  no stock grants were made to key management or the board  the k match was reduced by percent and all employees participated in two mandatory unpaid weeks off 
facility closures we closed charles city manufacturing facility at the end of the fourth quarter in fiscal we are now in the process of closing our hampton  iowa fiberglass manufacturing facility which will be completed in the first quarter of fiscal other certain promotional events typically held were cancelled and other spending reductions occurred throughout the company 

table of contents some of the actions described above were one time events  such as the mandatory unpaid weeks off  unless we decide to do these types of events again in fiscal we believe that we have the ability to sustain our current operational costs and maintain physical capacity at present levels for the foreseeable future in excess of months 
additional cost reduction activities will continue if market conditions do not improve 
we currently expect cash on hand  funds generated from operations if any and the availability of borrowings under the new credit facility to be sufficient to cover both short term and long term operation requirements 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to cash used in operating activities of million for the fiscal year ended august  cash provided in fiscal was due to significant inventory reductions of million and a reduction of deferred tax assets of million  partially offset by a million net loss and million reduction in accounts payable
