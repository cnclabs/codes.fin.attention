provision for income taxes the income tax provision for was recorded at a rate of percent of pretax income  similar to the percent of pretax income recorded for the income tax provision for the full year was recorded at a rate of percent

in the company substantially completed the exit of the marine products division  therefore for  there were no additional material charges incurred related to this discontinued operations event and the company does not expect any additional material charges in the future

weighted average shares outstanding the weighted average diluted shares outstanding for  and were million shares  million shares and million shares  respectively 
the decrease in the average diluted shares outstanding for each of the years is due principally to the share repurchase activity of the company 
critical accounting policies the significant accounting policies that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  sales promotions and incentives  share based employee compensation  dealer holdback programs  product warranties and product liability 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized at the time of shipment to the dealer  distributor or other customers 
historically  product returns  whether in the normal course of business or resulting from repurchases made under the floorplan financing program have not been material 
however  polaris has agreed to repurchase products repossessed by the finance companies up to certain limits 
polaris financial exposure is limited to the difference between the amount paid to the finance companies and the amount received on the resale of the repossessed product 
no material losses have been incurred under these agreements 
polaris has not historically recorded any significant sales return allowances because it has not been required to repurchase a significant number of units 
however  an adverse change in retail sales could cause this situation to change 
sales promotions and incentives polaris generally provides for estimated sales promotion and incentive expenses  which are recognized as a reduction to sales  at the time of sale to the dealer or distributor 
examples of sales promotion and incentive programs include dealer and consumer rebates  volume incentives  retail financing programs and sales associate incentives 
sales promotion and incentive expenses are estimated based on current programs and historical rates for each product line 
polaris records these amounts as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid 
at december  and  accrued sales promotions and incentives were million and million  respectively  reflecting a reduction in units in dealer inventory and an increase in the core atv and snowmobile sales promotions and incentives cost environment during actual results may differ from these estimates if market conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if the customer usage rate varies from historical trends 
adjustments to sales promotions and incentives accruals are made from time to time as actual usage becomes known in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to generate consumer demand based on market conditions as of the balance sheet date 
historically  sales promotion and incentive expenses have been within the company s expectations and differences have not been material 
share based employee compensation in the first quarter polaris adopted sfas r  which requires companies to recognize in the financial statements the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
polaris adopted sfas r using the modified retrospective 
table of contents method 
in accordance with the modified retrospective method  the consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been adjusted to give effect to the adoption of sfas r 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the date of grant requires judgment 
the company utilizes the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options consistent with the provisions of sfas r 
option pricing models  including the black scholes model  also require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
the company utilizes historical volatility as it believes this is reflective of market conditions 
the expected life of the awards is based on historical exercise patterns 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the company s history of dividend payouts 
sfas r requires the company to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation  as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if the actual forfeiture rate is higher or lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to increase or decrease the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in a decrease or increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
if forfeiture adjustments are made  they would affect the company s gross margin and operating expenses 
the effect of forfeiture adjustments subsequent to the adoption of sfas r in the first quarter of have been immaterial 
dealer holdback programs polaris provides dealer incentive programs whereby at the time of shipment polaris withholds an amount from the dealer until ultimate retail sale of the product 
polaris records these amounts as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid 
payments are generally made to dealers twice each year  in the first quarter and the third quarter  subject to previously established criteria 
polaris recorded accrued liabilities of million and million for dealer holdback programs in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively 
product warranties polaris provides a limited warranty for orvs for a period of six months and for a period of one year for its snowmobiles and motorcycles 
polaris may provide longer warranties related to certain promotional programs  as well as longer warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions 
polaris standard warranties require the company or its dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer 
the warranty reserve is established at the time of sale to the dealer or distributor based on management s best estimate using historical rates and trends 
polaris records these amounts as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid 
at december  and  the warranty reserve was million and million  respectively 
adjustments to the warranty reserve are made from time to time based on actual claims experience in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while management believes that the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
product liability polaris is subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business 
polaris self insures its product liability claims 
the estimated costs resulting from any losses are charged to operating expenses when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably determinable 
the company utilizes historical trends and actuarial analysis tools to assist in determining the appropriate loss reserve levels 
at december  and the company had accruals of million and million  respectively  for the possible payment of pending claims related to continuing operations 
these accruals are included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  the company had accruals of million and million at december  and  respectively  for the possible payment of pending claims related to discontinued operations 
while management believes the product liability reserves are adequate  adverse determination of material product liability claims made against the company could have a material adverse effect on polaris financial condition
