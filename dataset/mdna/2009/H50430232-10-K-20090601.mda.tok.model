the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth above in item a risk factors  and below in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview of our company logitech is a global leader in peripherals for personal computers and other digital platforms 
we develop and market innovative products in pc navigation  internet communications  digital music  home entertainment control  video security  interactive gaming and wireless devices 
for the pc  our products include mice  trackballs  keyboards  gaming controllers  multimedia speakers  headsets  webcams  and d control devices 
for digital music devices  our products include speakers  headphones  earphones and custom in ear monitors 
for gaming consoles  we offer a range of controllers and other accessories 
in addition  we offer wireless music solutions for the home  advanced remote controls for home entertainment systems and pc based video security systems for a home or small business 
we sell our products to a network of distributors and resellers retail and to original equipment manufacturers oems 
our worldwide retail network includes wholesale distributors  consumer electronics retailers  mass merchandisers  specialty electronics stores  computer and telecommunications stores  value added resellers and online merchants 
our sales to our retail channels were and of our net sales for the fiscal years ended march  and the large majority of our revenues are derived from sales of our products for use by consumers 
our markets are extremely competitive and characterized by short product life cycles  frequent new product introductions  rapidly changing technology  evolving customer demands  and aggressive promotional and pricing practices 
we believe that the current global economic downturn has further increased competition in our markets  as competitors with larger financial resources than us  such as microsoft  seek to gain market share by discounting prices or offering more favorable terms to customers  and competitors with smaller financial resources also discount prices or engage in other promotional practices in order to maintain their market share 
we believe continued investment in product research and development is critical to driving the innovation required to strengthen our competitive advantage 
we are committed to identifying and meeting current and future customer trends with new and improved product technologies  as well as leveraging the value of the logitech brand from a competitive  channel partner and consumer experience perspective 
we believe innovation and product quality are important to gaining market acceptance and maintaining market leadership 
over the last several years  we have broadened our product offerings and the markets in which we sell 
our product expansion has been primarily organic  but we have also grown as a result of a limited number of acquisitions that expanded our business into new product categories 
in light of the current global economic situation  we will continue to evaluate our strategy related to our product offerings 
summary of financial results the severe global economic recession had a substantial negative impact on our financial results for fiscal year our total net sales retail and oem for the year decreased to  million compared with the prior fiscal year  with retail sales declining and oem sales declining in the last six months of the fiscal year compared with the same period in the prior fiscal year 
retail sales in our americas region and europe  middle east and africa emea region declined and in fiscal year compared with fiscal year  reflecting consumers reluctance to spend and their preference for purchasing lower price products  as well as our channel partners decisions to reduce inventory levels 
retail sales in our asia pacific region for fiscal year increased 
an increase in asia pacific sales of in the first six months of the fiscal year was partially offset by a decline of in the last six months 
retail sales of all product lines except video decreased during fiscal year video retail sales increased compared with the depressed sales levels in fiscal year our gross margin for fiscal year decreased to compared with in the prior fiscal year  primarily due to the mix of products sold and increased promotional activity 
promotional activity includes contractual customer marketing and sales incentive programs  volume and consumer rebates and price protection programs  which impact our net sales and gross margin 
net income for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to million compared with million in the prior fiscal year 
net income for fiscal year included the negative impact of million in costs related to the restructuring plan initiated in january to reduce operating expenses and improve financial results in response to deteriorating global economic conditions 
trends in our business most of our revenue comes from sales to our retail channels  which resell to consumers 
as a result  our customers demand for our products depends on their reactions to current economic conditions  as well as trends in consumer confidence and consumer spending 
in the second half of fiscal year  our customers substantially decreased their inventory purchases  in reaction to the global decline in consumer demand and  to a lesser extent  as a result of retailer consolidation 
in addition  our sales to customers in eastern europe and other emerging markets have declined due to customers lack of available credit to finance purchases of inventory 
we believe it is likely that the decline in demand and sales compared with year ago periods will continue in all our regions at least through the first quarter of fiscal year we have a large and varied portfolio of product lines  grouped in several product families 
our total sales and profitability have been impacted recently by deteriorating general economic conditions 
however  within and subject to the general trend of decreasing sales and profitability  we believe that increases or decreases in the retail sales level of a product family are dependent on the innovation we have designed into the product  customer acceptance of the product line  the popularity of the digital platforms the product line relates to  and the prices at which products are available 
historically  sales of individual product lines rise and fall over time  and we expect these types of trends to continue 
we have historically targeted peripherals for the pc platform  a market that is dynamically changing as a result of the declining popularity of desktop pcs and the increasing popularity of notebook pcs and mobile devices  such as netbooks  mobile phones and smaller form factor devices with computing or web surfing capabilities 
in our retail channels  notebook pcs and mobile devices are sold by retailers without peripherals 
we believe this creates opportunities to sell products to consumers to help make their devices more productive and comfortable 
however  consumer acceptance and demand for peripherals for use with smaller form factor computing devices such as notebook pcs and mobile devices is still uncertain 
in particular  the increasing popularity of notebook pcs and mobile devices may result in a decreased demand by consumers for keyboards  desktops and speakers  which could negatively affect our sales of these products 
we believe our future sales growth will be significantly affected by our ability to develop sales and innovations in our current products as well as emerging product categories which are not pc dependent 
in addition  in our oem channel  the shift away from desktop pcs has adversely affected our sales of oem mice  which are sold with name brand desktop pcs 
our oem mice sales have historically made up the bulk of our oem sales  and our oem sales accounted for and of total revenues during fiscal years and we expect the trend of slowing oem mice sales to continue 
our oem sales were growing despite the decline in sales of mice due to our sales of microphones for use with particular game titles for gaming consoles 
however  these sales are tied to the title distributor agreeing to distribute our microphone with their game  and to the popularity of the particular game title 
we believe future oem sales growth depends on the development of new titles or products  consumers gaming purchase activity  and the manufacturers decision to combine our products with theirs  none of which is assured to occur 
although our financial results are reported in us dollars  nearly half of our sales are made in currencies other than the us dollar  such as the euro  british pound  chinese renminbi and japanese yen 
our product costs are primarily in us dollars and chinese renminbi 
our operating expenses are incurred in us dollars  euros  swiss francs  taiwanese dollars and  to a lesser extent  other currencies 
in previous years  our pricing strategy generally included  among other factors  raising or lowering selling prices in other currencies over time to avoid disparity with us dollar prices and to respond to currency driven competitive pricing actions 
in the current global economic downturn  our ability to manage local currency selling prices in response to changes in the us dollar has been reduced because of weak consumer spending 
we have chosen to prioritize sustaining and gaining market share in our product lines  rather than managing short term exchange rate fluctuations 
our gross margins vary with the mix of products sold  competitive activity  product life cycle  new product introductions  unit volumes  commodity and supply chain costs  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  geographic sales mix  and the complexity and functionality of new product introductions 
changes in consumer demand affect the need for us to undertake promotional efforts  such as cooperative marketing arrangements  customer incentive programs or price protection  which alters our product gross margins 
gross margins declined in fiscal year  compared with the prior fiscal year  due to product mix and increases in promotional efforts in response to sagging consumer demand 
we expect these trends to also affect gross margins in fiscal year logitech is incorporated in switzerland but operates in various countries with differing tax laws and rates 
a portion of our income before taxes and the provision for income taxes are generated outside of switzerland 
therefore  our effective tax rate depends on the amount of profits generated in each of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
the higher effective tax rates for the fiscal year ended march  compared with the prior fiscal year are principally the result of decreased income before income taxes and changes in the geographical mix of income 
in the fiscal quarter ended march   we implemented a restructuring plan which reduced logitech s salaried workforce globally by employees  in addition to other actions aimed at reducing operating expenses 
we incurred approximately million in pre tax restructuring charges related to employee termination costs  contract termination costs and other associated costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we expect to incur an additional million to million in related charges in fiscal year the restructuring plan is expected to generate annual personnel cost savings beginning in fiscal year of approximately million  and approximately million additional variable cost savings through efforts to limit production costs and operating expenses 
the size and timing of future restructuring charges and cost savings are estimates subject to significant future economic  competitive and other uncertainties  and there can be no assurance that we will fully realize the anticipated future results 
in the event that the current economic conditions significantly worsen  further restructuring measures may be required in the future 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap requires the company to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate critical if it i requires management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain  and ii is important to an understanding of logitech s financial condition and operating results 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe the following accounting estimates are most critical to our business operations and to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations  and reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accruals for customer programs we record accruals for product returns  cooperative marketing arrangements  customer incentive programs and price protection 
the estimated cost of these programs is accrued in the period the company sells the product or commits to the program as a reduction of revenue or as an operating expense  if we receive a separately identifiable benefit from the customer and can reasonably estimate the fair value of that benefit 
significant management judgment and estimates must be used to determine the cost of these programs in any accounting period 
returns 
the company grants limited rights to return product 
return rights vary by customer  and range from just the right to return defective product to stock rotation rights to return a limited percentage of the previous quarter s purchases 
estimates of expected future product returns are recognized at the time of sale based on analyses of historical return trends by customer and by product  inventories owned by and located at distributors and retailers  current customer demand  current operating conditions  and other relevant customer and product information  such as stage of product life cycle 
return trends are influenced by the timing of the sale  the type of customer  operational policies and procedures  product sell through  product quality issues  sales levels  market acceptance of products  competitive pressures  new product introductions  product life cycle status  and other factors 
return rates can fluctuate over time  but are sufficiently predictable to allow us to estimate expected future product returns 
cooperative marketing arrangements 
the company s cooperative marketing arrangements include contractual customer marketing and sales incentive programs 
we enter into customer marketing programs with many of our distribution and retail customers allowing customers to receive a credit equal to a set percentage of their purchases of the company s products  or a fixed dollar credit for various marketing programs 
the objective of these programs is to encourage advertising and promotional events to increase sales of our products 
accruals for the estimated costs of these marketing programs are recorded based on the contractual percentage of product purchased in the period we recognize revenue 
the company also offers rebates and discounts for certain types of sell through programs 
accruals for these sales incentive programs are recorded at the time of sale  or time of commitment  based on negotiated terms  historical experience and inventory levels in the channel 
customer incentive programs 
customer incentive programs include volume and consumer rebates 
we offer volume rebates to our distribution and retail customers related to purchase volumes or sales of specific products by distributors to specified retailers 
reserves for volume rebates are recognized as a reduction of the sale price at the time of sale 
estimates of required reserves are determined based on negotiated terms  consideration of historical experience  anticipated volume of future purchases  and inventory levels in the channel 
consumer rebates are offered from time to time at the company s discretion directly to end users 
estimated costs of consumer rebates and similar incentives are recorded at the time the incentive is offered  based on the specific terms and conditions 
certain incentive programs  including consumer rebates  require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular programs 
price protection and special pricing 
we have contractual agreements with certain of our customers that contain terms allowing price protection credits to be issued in the event of a subsequent price reduction contractual price protection 
at management s discretion  we also offer special pricing discounts to certain customers 
special pricing discounts are usually offered only for limited time periods or for sales to specific indirect partners 
our decision to make price reductions is influenced by channel inventory levels  product life cycle stage  market acceptance of products  the competitive environment  new product introductions and other factors 
credits are issued for units that customers have on hand or in transit at the date of the price reduction 
reserves for the estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers are established quarterly based on planned price reductions  analyses of qualified inventories on hand with distributors and retailers and historical trends by customer and by product 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our accruals for product returns  cooperative marketing arrangements  customer incentive programs and price protection 
future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to take action to increase such programs 
in addition  when the variables used to estimate these costs change  or if actual costs differ significantly from the estimates  we would be required to record incremental reductions to revenue or increase operating expenses 
if  at any future time  the company becomes unable to reasonably estimate these costs  recognition of revenue might be deferred until products are sold to end users  which would adversely impact revenue in the period of transition 
short term investments we have short term investments that are primarily auction rate securities and are classified as available for sale as of march  auction rate securities generally have maturity dates greater than years  with interest rates that typically reset through an auction every days 
the company s short term investments are reported at estimated fair value 
the fair value of short term investments is estimated based on quoted market prices  if available  or by estimating the values of the underlying collateral using published mortgage indices or interest rate spreads for comparably rated collateral and applying discounted cash flow or option pricing methods to the estimated collateral value 
the markets for the auction rate securities we hold as of march  have failed since august  and due to continuing dislocations in the worldwide credit markets  are not expected to resume in the foreseeable future  if at all 
as a result  the company has valued the remaining million in short term investments in its portfolio as of march  solely by pricing the underlying collateral using published mortgage indices or interest rate spreads for comparably rated collateral pools and applying discounted cash flow or option pricing methods to the estimated collateral value 
allowance for doubtful accounts we sell our products through a worldwide network of distributors  retailers and oem customers 
logitech generally does not require any collateral from its customers 
however  we seek to control our credit risk through ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts 
the allowances are based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  including their credit worthiness and financial condition  as well as the company s historical experience with bad debts and customer deductions  receivables aging  current economic trends and geographic or country specific risks and the financial condition of our distribution channel 
if management determines that a customer s accounts receivable balance is uncollectible  recognition of revenue from that customer is deferred until collectibility is reasonably assured 
as of march   two customers represented and of total accounts receivable 
the customers comprising the ten highest outstanding trade receivable balances accounted for approximately of total accounts receivable as of march  a deterioration of a significant customer s financial condition could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the estimated allowance 
if any of these customers receivable balances should be deemed uncollectible or if actual write offs are higher than historical experience  we would have to make adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts  which could result in an increase in the company s operating expenses 
inventory valuation the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of customer orders 
further  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  short term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand 
we record inventories at the lower of cost or market value and record write downs of inventories which are obsolete or in excess of anticipated demand or market value 
a review of inventory is performed each fiscal quarter that considers factors including the marketability and product life cycle stage  product development plans  component cost trends  demand forecasts and current sales levels 
we identify inventory exposures by comparing inventory on hand  in the channel and on order to historical and forecasted sales over six month periods 
inventory on hand which is not expected to be sold or utilized based on review of forecasted sales and utilization is considered excess  and we recognize the write off in cost of sales at the time of such determination 
at the time of loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances would not result in an increase in the cost basis 
if there were an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for logitech s products or an unanticipated change in technological or customer requirements  we may be required to record additional write downs which could adversely affect gross margins in the period when the write downs are recorded 
share based compensation expense share based compensation expense includes compensation expense  reduced for estimated forfeitures  for awards granted after april  based on the grant date fair value estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing valuation model for stock options and stock purchases and the monte carlo simulation model for restricted stock units rsus 
compensation expense for these awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the service period of the award 
for share based compensation awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of april   share based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing valuation model reduced for estimated forfeitures  and recognized on a straight line basis over the service period for each separately vesting portion of the award 
see note employee benefit plans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of share based compensation 
our estimates of share based compensation expense require a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns  future forfeitures  dividend yield  related tax effects and the selection of an appropriate fair value model 
we estimate expected share price volatility based on historical volatility using daily prices over the term of past options  rsus or purchase offerings  as we consider historical share price volatility as most representative of future stock option volatility 
we estimate expected life based on historical settlement rates  which we believe are most representative of future exercise and post vesting termination behaviors 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures  and we record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the company s history and future expectations of dividend payouts 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based compensation expense and related tax effects represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future from what we have recorded in the current period  which could materially affect our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes logitech operates in multiple jurisdictions and its profits are taxed pursuant to the tax laws of these jurisdictions 
the company s effective tax rate may be affected by the changes in or interpretations of tax laws in any given jurisdiction  utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  changes in geographical mix of income and expense  and changes in management s assessment of matters such as the ability to realize deferred tax assets 
as a result of these considerations  we must estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  considering all available evidence such as historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies 
we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized  however  ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time 
in the event we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin as of april   as required 
the implementation of the provisions of fin requires us to make certain estimates and judgments about the application of tax law  the expected resolution of uncertain tax positions and other matters 
in the event that uncertain tax positions are resolved for amounts different than our estimates  or the related statutes of limitations expire without the assessment of additional income taxes  we will be required to adjust the amounts of the related assets and liabilities in the period in which such events occur 
such adjustments may have a material impact on our income tax provision and our results of operations 
note of the consolidated financial statements describes fin and the effects on our results of operations and financial position arising from its adoption 
valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets  such as investments  property  plant and equipment  and goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of these assets might not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could require us to review an asset for impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and market capitalization relative to net book value 
recoverability of investments  property  plant and equipment  and other intangible assets is measured by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate with its carrying amount 
if an asset is considered impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from our estimated future cash flows 
recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired  and a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
while the company has fully integrated all of its acquired companies  it continues to maintain discrete financial information for dconnexion and accordingly determines impairment for the goodwill acquired with the dconnexion acquisition at the entity level 
all other acquired goodwill is evaluated for impairment at a total enterprise level 
in determining fair value  we consider various factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods over which our assets will be utilized  and other variables 
we calculate the company s fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate to the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
to date  we have not recognized any impairment of goodwill 
logitech bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain

net sales reflect accruals for product returns  cooperative marketing arrangements  customer incentive programs and price protection 
the decline in retail sales in fiscal year compared with fiscal year was attributable to the global economic downturn  as reflected in consumers reluctance to spend and their buying preference for lower price products  and our channel partners decisions to reduce inventory levels 
retail sales declined in the last six months of fiscal year  compared with an increase of in the first six months 
oem sales were higher for fiscal year  due to demand in the first three fiscal quarters of the year for our microphones for singing games 
approximately of our sales in fiscal year were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which compares with approximately in fiscal year if foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal year had been the same as in fiscal year  our total sales decrease would have been instead of 
the negative impact on net sales of the strengthening of the us dollar in the six months ended march  offset the positive effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which benefited net sales in the six months ended september   resulting in an immaterial impact of exchange rates on net sales for the fiscal year considered as a whole 
retail pointing devices 
retail sales of our pointing devices decreased and units decreased in fiscal year compared with the prior fiscal year 
sales of corded mice declined  with units decreasing 
sales of cordless mice increased and units increased  primarily driven by sales of our notebook mice the v nano cordless mouse  the v cordless optical mouse  and the v nano cordless laser mouse 
the slower decline or higher increase in unit sales compared with dollar sales for cordless and corded mice indicates consumers current preference for the value segment of our product lines 
retail keyboards and desktops 
sales of keyboards and desktops decreased and units decreased during fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales of corded keyboards and desktops decreased and units decreased 
sales of cordless keyboards and desktops decreased  with a decline in units  with strong sales of our cordless desktops ex and mx more than offset by declines in sales of the mx laser and ex cordless desktops 
retail audio 
retail audio sales declined in fiscal year  with units down  primarily due to lower pc speaker sales  which decreased in dollars and in units 
the decline in pc speaker sales was primarily attributable to weakness in our product line due to product transitions  in addition to the deteriorating demand environment 
sales of our ipod speakers increased in fiscal year  with an increase in units  primarily due to strong contributions from our purefi anywhere speakers 
pc headset sales grew and units increased  driven by our new clearchat pc wireless and clearchat comfort usb headsets 
streaming media and ultimate ears products also provided positive contributions to retail audio sales 
retail video 
video sales increased and units increased  primarily attributable to sales of our wilife video security products in fiscal year  and depressed comparative sales in fiscal year sales of our communicate mp and quickcam connect webcams were also strong  but were offset by a decline in sales of our quickcam communicate stx

approximately of the company s sales were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in fiscal year net sales growth benefited from the strengthening of the euro during fiscal year  however this benefit does not consider the impact that currency fluctuations had on our pricing strategy  which may result in selling prices in one currency being raised or lowered to avoid disparity with us dollar prices and to respond to currency driven competitive pricing actions 
retail pointing devices 
sales of our pointing devices increased and units increased during fiscal year compared with fiscal year the growth was led by sales of our cordless mice which increased during the year  with units increasing

modest sales growth in the emea region has hindered the company s overall sales growth for each of the four quarters of fiscal year the disparity between sales growth and unit growth in all regions was primarily due to product mix and currency fluctuations 
in particular  the strengthening of the euro in fiscal year positively impacted the sales growth in the emea region  however this benefit does not consider the impact that currency fluctuations have on the company s pricing strategy  which may result in selling prices in one currency being raised or lowered to avoid disparity with us dollar prices and to respond to currency driven competitive pricing actions

logitech transacts business in over currencies worldwide  of which the most significant to operations are the chinese renminbi cny  euro  british pound  japanese yen  taiwanese dollar  mexican peso and swiss franc 
the functional currency of the company s operations is primarily the us dollar 
to a lesser extent  certain operations use the euro  swiss franc  japanese yen or the local currency of the country as their functional currencies 
accordingly  unrealized foreign currency gains or losses resulting from the translation of net assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to the us dollar are accumulated in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity

the company s principal manufacturing operations are located in china  with much of its component and raw material costs transacted in cny 
however  the functional currency of its chinese operating subsidiary is the us dollar as its sales and trade receivables are transacted in us dollars 
to hedge against any potential significant appreciation of the cny  the company transferred a portion of its cash investments to cny accounts 
at march   net assets held in cny totaled million 
the company continues to evaluate the level of net assets held in cny relative to component and raw material purchases and interest rates on cash equivalents 
from time to time  certain subsidiaries enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge inventory purchase exposures denominated in us dollars 
the amount of the forward exchange contracts is based on forecasts of inventory purchases 
these forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions 
logitech does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
gains and losses in the fair value of the effective portion of contracts are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged inventory purchases are sold  at which time the gains or losses are reclassified to cost of goods sold 
as of march   the notional amount of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding for forecasted inventory exposures was million
