item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k report  including the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements regarding future events and the future results of juniper networks  inc the company that are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts  and projections about the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management 
words such as expects  anticipates  targets  goals  projects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this report under the section entitled risk factors in item a of part i and elsewhere  and in other reports we file with the sec  specifically the most recent reports on form q 
while forward looking statements are our best prediction at the time that they are made  you should not rely on them 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason 
the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in the course of operating our business  we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices  the collection of receivables  the manufacturing  and shipment of products  the fulfillment of orders  the purchase of supplies  and the building of inventory and spare parts  among other matters 
each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period 
in making these decisions  we consider various factors including contractual obligations  customer satisfaction  competition  internal and external financial targets and expectations  and financial planning objectives 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns  pricing credits  warranty costs  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long term assets  especially goodwill and intangible assets  contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges  assumptions used in the valuation of stock based compensation  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this report  we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the significant events that affected the most recent fiscal year and a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses 
these sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed 
table of contents discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this item  our risk factors section included in item a of part i  and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in item of part ii of this report 
executive overview our performance was the result of a combination of strong market demand for networking and security products as well as our focused execution and market share gains 
in addition  we began shipment of several new products  which contributed to our revenue growth during the year 
while revenue growth was substantial  towards the end of worldwide economic conditions  in particular the slowdown in the us  led to slowing rates of growth and reduced our visibility into future periods 
during  we continued implementation of a series of operational excellence initiatives 
these initiatives are intended to strengthen the management systems and processes throughout our organization to support our growth and to improve operational efficiency and contain costs in the face of difficult economic and market conditions 
change change in millions  except per share amounts and percentages net revenues operating income percentage of net revenues net income percentage of net revenues net income per share basic diluted net revenues our net revenues increased in compared to  primarily due to the growing acceptance of our router and firewall products and services in the service provider and enterprise markets 
we experienced growth in both product and service revenues  which represented and  respectively  of our total net revenues in product revenues increased million  or  to  million in compared to service revenues increased million  or  to million in compared to net revenues increased in each of our three geographic regions in compared to operating income our operating income as well as operating margin as a percentage of net revenues increased in compared to these increases were  in large part  due to the growth in revenues and a decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net revenues  which was attributable to our efforts to better manage expenses and improve efficiencies in compared to in our effort to manage our expenses  we expanded our r d headcount in regions with lower operating costs 
net income and net income per share the increase in net income and net income per share in compared to  is primarily due to the increase in operating income  which resulted from the growth in revenues  and the reduction in operating expense as a percentage of net revenues  which is attributable to a decrease in the amortization of purchased intangible assets and the implementation of certain cost reduction initiatives compared to the increase in operating income was partially offset by lower net interest and other income primarily due to lower interest rates along with higher income tax expense in other financial highlights total deferred revenue increased million in  primarily due to the growth in our installed equipment base for maintenance and customer support contracts 
in  we generated a net increase of million in cash and cash equivalents  primarily resulting from million in cash provided by our operating activities  which was offset by the repurchase of million of our common stock 

table of contents significant events business and market environment we design  develop  and sell products and services that together provide our customers with high performance network infrastructure that creates responsive and trusted environments for accelerating the deployment of services and applications over a single ip based network 
we serve the high performance networking requirements of global service providers  enterprises  governments  and research and education institutions that view the network as critical to their success 
high performance networking is designed to provide fast  reliable  and secure access to applications and services at scale 
we offer a high performance network infrastructure that includes ip routing  ethernet switching  security  and application acceleration solutions  as well as partnerships designed to extend the value of the network and worldwide services and support designed to optimize customer investments 
in  we continued to deliver new and innovative  high performance network infrastructure solutions 
we entered the enterprise switching market  through the introduction of the ex series  a family of ethernet switches that leverage the operational simplicity and carrier class reliability of our junos software 
we also introduced a new category of extensible networking and security products with our srx series dynamic services gateways 
in addition  we introduced a new family of idp appliances that deliver up to gigabits per second real world throughput and performance to enable deployments in the network core  the integration of services  including firewall and chassis clustering  into junos software for implementation on the j series services router and the security threat response manager strm  a platform capable of providing businesses with a centralized scalable and effective way to log and manage a rapidly evolving threat landscape 
we also announced an advanced mobile ip multi protocol label switching mpls solution portfolio with the new bx multi access gateway router for the cell site  m series circuit emulation physical interface cards for the aggregation site  and a suite of software features designed to simplify deployment  provisioning and management of mobile backhaul networks 
in addition  we introduced the jcs  a dedicated high performance control plane scaling platform 
we also delivered new enhancements to existing solutions to help customers maximize their network infrastructure investments and lower their overall total cost of ownership 
we expanded our network and security manager nsm to deliver a centralized management solution for routing  security  and switching  enabling customers to consolidate and simplify the management of their network infrastructure 
we announced enhancements to our access control solution  to deliver enhanced scalability and performance  with centralized access policy management via nsm  helping customers cost effectively achieve comprehensive network visibility with broad enforcement capabilities 
we introduced the next generation of our wxc application acceleration platforms to deliver a more scalable  modular  and cost effective approach to delivering fast and consistent application response across the wan 
in addition  we announced three new line card families for the mx series ethernet services routers 
in  the growing weakness of the global economy  and in the united states in particular  has affected the purchasing behavior of our customers and led to lower revenue growth in our fourth quarter compared to previous quarters  delays in purchase decisions  and reduced visibility regarding future business 
if economic growth in the united states and other countries economies continues to decline and or fail to recover  our customers may delay or reduce their purchases 
this could result in reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles  slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition 
in  we will continue to invest in key research and development projects that we believe will lead to future growth while at the same time containing other costs and allocating resources effectively 
japan distributor audit in december  during the course of our performance of routine distributor audits  we became aware of facts that caused us to question the accuracy of point of sale reports of a few distributors in japan with respect to a small number of transactions 
as a result  we commenced a review of revenue from sales through distributors in japan  which was completed prior to the filing of this report 
as a result of this review  we deferred million of revenue for sales through distributors in japan 
total revenues through distributors in japan  after the million deferral  were approximately million in and approximately million in the three months ended december  for financial data for the quarter ended december   which incorporates the results of 
table of contents this review  please see note selected quarterly financial data unaudited in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
stock repurchase activity in  we repurchased million  or million share of common stock  under the following two stock repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors the board 
under the billion stock repurchase program approved in and the stock repurchase program  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share for a total purchase price of million in as of december   we had repurchased and retired approximately million shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program at an average price of per share 
the program has no remaining authorized funds available for future stock repurchases 
the board approved a billion stock repurchase program in march the stock repurchase program 
under this program  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share for a total purchase price of million in as of december   the stock repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of million 
see note subsequent events in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k  for discussion of our stock repurchase activity in nature of expenses most of our manufacturing  repair  and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers 
accordingly  most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs 
the independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications  quality assurance programs  and standards that we establish 
controls around manufacturing  engineering  and documentation are conducted at our facilities in sunnyvale  california  and westford  massachusetts 
our independent contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in canada  china  malaysia  mexico  and the united states 
we generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment 
the contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts  and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts  we may be  and have been in the past  liable for carrying or obsolete material charges 
in recent years  an increasing amount of our products have been manufactured in asia  and we anticipate that a larger percentage of our products will be produced outside the united states and canada in the future 
our contracts generally provide for passage of title and risk of loss at the designated point of shipment to the customer 
the manufacturing of products in asia for shipment to customers in emea and the americas resulted in additional shipment logistics  freight and timing issues for us and those customers 
in an ongoing effort to balance our and the customers needs  we have made changes on occasion to the payment of freight and the point of shipment with respect to products shipped from asia 
these changes impact shipping costs and the timing of revenue recognition of the affected shipments 
we have employees in our manufacturing and operations organization who manage relationships with our contract manufacturers  manage our supply chain  and monitor product testing and quality 
employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses  and we expect this trend to continue 
employee related costs include items such as wages  commissions  bonuses  vacation  benefits  stock based compensation  and travel 
we had   and  employees as of december    and  respectively 
the year over year increases were primarily attributable to increases in our research and development and sales and marketing organizations 
our headcount is expected to remain flat in as we continue our cost reduction activities 
we accounted for stock based compensation under the fair value approach of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  in   and details of our stock based compensation expense are described in note employee 
table of contents benefit plans in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on usage and headcount  respectively 
these departmental costs have increased in   and due to increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from infrastructure systems added to support our growth and past acquisitions 
facility and information technology related headcount was   and as of december    and  respectively 
in  we expect to continue to invest in our company wide information technology infrastructure as we implement our operational excellence initiatives 
our operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound  the euro  indian rupee  and japanese yen 
changes in related currency exchange rates may affect our operating results 
periodically  we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses 
the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  and  upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction  is subsequently reclassified into the appropriate line item of the consolidated statement of operations to which the hedged transaction relates 
any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments is reported in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
the increase in operating expenses including research and development  sales and marketing  as well as general and administrative expenses  due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience  and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates 
such accounting policies require significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations may be affected 
revenue recognition 
our products are generally integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of our equipment 
additionally  we provide unspecified upgrades and enhancements related to our integrated software through our maintenance contracts for most of our products 
accordingly  we account for revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we generally rely upon sales contracts  or agreements and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we use shipping terms and related documents or written evidence of customer acceptance  when applicable  to verify delivery or performance 
in instances where we have outstanding obligations related to product delivery or the final acceptance of the product  revenue is deferred until all the delivery and acceptance criteria have been met 
sales price is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
collectability is reasonably assured 
we assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by our credit checks and the customer s payment history 
we record accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts  estimated customer returns  and pricing credits 

table of contents for arrangements with multiple elements  such as sales of products that include services  we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the undelivered items 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements 
vsoe of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition 
if vsoe of fair value of one or more undelivered items does not exist  revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of i delivery of those elements or ii when fair value can be established unless maintenance is the only undelivered element  in which case  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual support period 
our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than fair value 
in addition  our ability to recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers 
for sales to direct end users and value added resellers  we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is generally upon shipment 
it is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a value added reseller 
for our end users and value added resellers  there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits 
a portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits or rights of return 
we recognize product revenue on sales made through these distributors upon sell through as reported to us by the distributors 
deferred revenue on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor pricing credits and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized upon sell through 
deferred revenue is recorded net of the related product costs of revenue 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments  such as rebates and price protection  in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection credits  specific criteria included in rebate agreements  and other factors known at the time 
should actual product returns or pricing adjustments differ from our estimates  additional reductions to revenue may be required 
in addition  we report revenue net of sales taxes 
services include maintenance  training  and professional services 
maintenance is offered under renewable contracts 
revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the contractual support period  which is generally one to three years 
revenue from training and professional services is recognized as the services are completed or ratably over the contractual period  which is generally one year or less 
we sell certain interests in accounts receivable on a non recourse basis as part of a distributor accounts receivable financing arrangement primarily with one major financing company 
we record cash received under this arrangement in advance of revenue recognition as short term debt with a balance of million and million as of december   and  respectively 
contract manufacturer liabilities 
we outsource most of our manufacturing  repair  and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them 
our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our products based on our demand forecasts 
these forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products  which are in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations  adjusted for overall market conditions 
we establish a provision for inventory  carrying costs and obsolete material exposures for excess components purchased based on historical trends 
if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecasted  which may be caused by factors outside of our control  it could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times 
warranty costs 
we generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products 
we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs  labor costs for customer support  and overhead at the time revenue is recognized 
material cost is estimated primarily based upon the historical costs to repair or replace product returns within the warranty period 
technical support labor and overhead cost are estimated primarily based upon historical trends in the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  use 
table of contents of materials  technical labor costs and associated overhead incurred 
should actual product failure rates  use of materials  or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  we may incur additional warranty costs  which could reduce gross margin 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques 
goodwill is measured as the excess purchase price of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i future declines in our operating results  ii a sustained decline in our market capitalization  iii significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the networking industry  or iv failure to meet our forecasted operating results 
we evaluate these assets on an annual basis as of november or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in the process of our annual impairment review  we determine the fair value of our intangible assets based upon a weighting of the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  we estimate fair value of our reporting units by comparing them to transactions involving publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 
under the income approach  we calculate fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the weighted fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the allocated book value of each reporting unit 
if the book value exceeds the fair value  we revalue the assets associated with the impaired reporting unit 
the impairment is the difference between the new fair values and the existing book values of the impaired asset 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
if our actual results or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
stock based compensation 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards including employee stock options  restricted stock units rsus  performance share awards  and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan granted after december   and granted prior to but not yet vested as of december   in accordance with sfas r 
we valued compensation expense for expected to vest stock based awards that were granted on or prior to december   under the multiple option approach 
we amortize these share based payments using the accelerated attribution method 
subsequent to december   compensation expense for expected to vest stock based awards is valued under the single option approach and amortized on a straight line basis  net of estimated forfeitures 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based compensation under the intrinsic value recognition provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
we utilize the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model and incorporate a monte carlo simulation when appropriate in order to determine the fair value of stock based awards under sfas r 
the bsm model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility  expected option life  and risk free interest rate 
the expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock  adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options 
the expected life of an award is based on historical experience  the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees  as well as the potential effect from options that have not been exercised at the time 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates 
these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those expected to vest shares 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our recorded stock based compensation expense could be different 
income taxes 
estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences and carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to 
table of contents taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
to the extent that we believe any amounts are not more likely than not to be realized  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets 
we believe it is more likely than not that future income from the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities and forecasted income will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event we determine that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
similarly  if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable  the respective valuation allowance would be reversed  resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed  a further charge to expense would result 
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
on january   we adopted financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which was a change in accounting for income taxes 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
additionally  fin provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
the application of fin may increase an entity s future effective tax rates and its future intra period effective tax rate volatility 
as of january   our cumulative effect of applying fin was a million increase to the opening balance of accumulated deficit and a million increase to goodwill 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions under fin and determining our provision for income taxes 
although we believe our reserves under fin are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserves under fin and any changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest and penalties  if applicable 
loss contingencies 
we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset  or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can 
table of contents be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes  litigation  and other legal actions 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and these actions or other third party claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges 
in addition  the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments  which could adversely impact gross margins in future periods 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows could be adversely affected 
the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses 
recent accounting pronouncements see note summary of significant accounting policies in notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k  for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on financial condition and results of operations  which is incorporated herein by reference 
results of operations the following table shows total net product and service revenues and net product and service revenues as a percentage of total net revenues in millions  except percentages years ended december  years ended december  change change change change net revenues product percentage of net revenues service percentage of net revenues total net revenues our net product revenues increased in compared to primarily due to increased sales of products from both our infrastructure and slt solutions to the service provider and enterprise markets 
in particular  we had success in selling our infrastructure products to service providers who are adopting ngn ip networks  which are designed for higher capacity and efficiency to help reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network 
in  our new product releases and further expansion into emerging markets contributed to the increase in total net product revenues 
our net service revenues increased in compared to primarily due to the increase in maintenance revenue from our expanding installed base of equipment under service contracts 
our net revenues increased in compared to primarily due to growth in both product and service revenues 
our revenue performance and share gains were driven by infrastructure and slt product revenues 
service revenues also increased in compared to primarily due to the increase in our installed base of equipment under service contracts and  to a lesser extent  growth in professional service revenues 

table of contents changes to segments beginning in january  we realigned our reporting structure which resulted in two segments infrastructure and slt 
the previously reported service segment has been combined into the following two segments infrastructure our infrastructure segment consists primarily of products and services related to the e  m  mx  and t series router product families  ex series switching products  as well as the circuit to circuit products 
slt our slt segment consists primarily of products and services related to our firewall vpn firewall systems and appliances  ssl vpn appliances  idp appliances  the j series router product family  and wan optimization platforms

infrastructure product infrastructure product revenues increased in compared to  primarily attributable to revenue growth from our m mx and t series product families  from sales to both the service provider and enterprise markets due to our customers increased demand for network infrastructure solutions 
to a lesser extent  our ex series products  which were introduced in the first quarter of  and our e series products also contributed to the revenue growth in in  we experienced sales growth in both the service provider and enterprise markets 
from a geographical perspective  in  we experienced revenue growth in all three regions  with particular strength in the americas region 
infrastructure product revenues increased in compared to  primarily attributable to increased revenues from our m  t  and mx series router products  driven by our service provider customers continued build out of ngns as their bandwidth requirement increased 
our service provider customers also moved towards ngns that are designed to enable a fast and cost effective deployment of differentiating multi play services that allow them to generate new sources of revenues 
also contributing to the revenue growth was an increase in infrastructure product sales to the content service provider and the enterprise markets 
from a geographical perspective  we experienced revenue growth in all three regions with particular strength in the americas region 
we track infrastructure chassis revenue units and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth 
most of our infrastructure product platforms are modular  with the chassis serving as the base of the platform 
each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces 
the modules are the components through which the platform receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media 
the physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port 
the number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module 
chassis revenue units represent the number of 
table of contents chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period 
the following table shows infrastructure revenue units and ports shipped years ended december  years ended december  unit change change unit change change infrastructure chassis revenue units infrastructure ports shipped excludes fixed configuration ethernet switching products 
infrastructure chassis revenue units increased in compared to  primarily due to the product mix that favored higher capacity chassis revenue units  which was driven by bandwidth demand as our customers sought to expand capabilities in their networks and to offer differentiating  feature rich  multi play services that allow them to generate new sources of revenues 
the port shipments also increased in compared to primarily due to the increase in the overall number of chassis revenue units from richly configured t and m series router chassis revenue units shipped during the period 
chassis revenue units increased in compared to  primarily due to the introduction of the mx series products  which are our carrier ethernet services routers 
we also experienced growth in our m and t series products  driven by bandwidth demand as service provider customers sought to expand voice and video capability in their existing networks 
the port shipment units increased in compared to  primarily due to the growth in chassis revenue units with larger expansion capacity and our customers need to differentiate themselves by providing feature rich  multi play services 
infrastructure service infrastructure service revenues increased in compared to  primarily due to an increase in our installed base of equipment being serviced 
installed base is calculated based on the number of systems that our customers have under maintenance

our longest lease expires in january in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply  our contract manufacturers place non cancelable  non returnable ncnr orders for components based on our build forecasts 
the contract manufacturers use the components to build products based on our forecasts and on purchase orders we have received from our customers 
generally  we do not own the components and title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location 
if the components go unused or the products go unsold for specified periods of time  we may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 
as of december   we had accrued million based on our estimate of such charges 
total purchase commitments as of december   consisted of million ncnr orders 
tax liabilities include the current and long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions 
it is reasonably possible that we may reach agreement with certain issues and  as a result  the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately million within the next months 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to the additional million in liabilities due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 
other contractual obligations consist of an acquisition related escrow amount of million  a joint development agreement requiring quarterly payments of million through january  a software subscription for million requiring payments through january  and a data center hosting agreement for million  requiring payment through april guarantees we have entered into agreements with some of our customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of a third party 
other guarantees or indemnification arrangements include guarantees of product and service performance and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities 
we have not recorded a liability related to these indemnification and guarantee provisions  and our guarantees and indemnification arrangements have not had any significant impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents stock repurchase activities in  we repurchased million or million shares of common stock  under the following two stock repurchase programs authorized by our board under the billion stock repurchase program approved in and the stock repurchase program  we repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock at an average price of per share for a total purchase price of million during as of december   we have repurchased and retired approximately million shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program at an average price of per share  and the program had no remaining authorized funds available for future stock repurchases 
the board approved another billion stock repurchase program in march the stock repurchase program 
under this program  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share for a total purchase price of million in as of december   the stock repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of million 
all shares of common stock purchased under the and stock repurchase programs have been retired 
future share repurchases under our stock repurchase program will be subject to a review of the circumstances in place at the time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements 
this program may be discontinued at any time 
see note subsequent events in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k  for discussion of our stock repurchase activity in liquidity and capital resource requirements liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships we may make in the future 
additionally  if we were to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program  our liquidity may be impacted 
we also have a substantial portion of our cash and investment balances held overseas and may be subject to us taxes if repatriated 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments  together with cash generated from operations and cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations  debt  and growth for at least the next months 
we believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures  commitments  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period 
however  our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors  including the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins  our business  product  capital expenditures  and research and development plans  the market acceptance of our products  repurchases of our common stock  issuance and repayment of debt  litigation expenses  settlements  and judgments  volume price discounts and customer rebates  the levels of accounts receivable that we maintain  acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products  or technologies  changes in our compensation policies  capital improvements for new and existing facilities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
in addition  a portion of our cash and marketable securities are held in non us domiciled countries 
our marketable securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at any time  a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
the following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at december   and  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in millions valuation of securities given an interest valuation of securities given an rate decrease of x basis points fair value as of interest bps december  rate increase of x bps bps bps bps bps bps bps government treasury and agencies corporate bonds and notes other total valuation of securities given an interest valuation of securities given an rate decrease of x basis points fair value as of interest bps december  rate increase of x bps bps bps bps bps bps bps government treasury and agencies corporate bonds and notes asset backed securities and other total 
table of contents these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps  which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 
foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts periodically  we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the re measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income expense in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities 
these foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one and two months 
our sales and costs of revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars 
our operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound  the euro  indian rupee  and japanese yen 
periodically  we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year 
the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and  upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction  is subsequently reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of operations to which the hedged transaction relates 
we record any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments  which was immaterial during the years ended december    and  respectively  in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
the increase in operating expenses including research and development  sales and marketing  as well as general and administrative expenses  due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately in equity price risk our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities is inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates 
we monitor our equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis 
in the event that the carrying value of the equity investments exceeds its fair value  and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary  we reduce the carrying value to its current fair value 
in  we realized an impairment charge of million on a publicly traded equity security due to a sustained decline in the fair value  in excess of six months  of the investment below its cost basis that we judged to be other than temporary 
we do not purchase our equity securities with the intent to use them for trading or speculative purposes 
the aggregate fair value of our marketable equity securities was million and million as of december   and  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse change in the stock prices of our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities would result in an immaterial loss 
in addition to publicly traded securities  we have also invested in privately held companies 
these investments are carried at cost 
in  we realized an impairment charge of million on minority equity investments in privately held companies that we judged to be other than temporary 
the aggregate cost of our investments in privately held companies was million and million as of december   and  respectively
