intersegment services aesc is a service company for ae that employs substantially all of the allegheny personnel who provide services to ae and its subsidiaries  including ae supply  agc  the distribution companies  trail company  path  llc and their respective subsidiaries 
these companies reimburse aesc at cost for services provided to them by aesc s employees 
aesc had  employees as of december  key indicators and performance factors the delivery and services segment allegheny monitors the financial and operating performance of its delivery and services segment using a number of indicators and performance statistics  including the following revenue per megawatt hour mwh sold 
this measure is calculated by dividing total revenues from retail sales of electricity by total mwhs sold to retail customers 
revenue per mwh sold was as follows revenue per mwh sold operations and maintenance costs o m 
management closely monitors and manages o m in absolute terms  as well as in relation to total mwhs sold 
o m per mwh sold was as follows o m per mwh sold capital expenditures 
management prioritizes and manages capital expenditures to meet operational needs and regulatory requirements within available cash flow constraints 
retail electricity sales 
the following table provides retail electricity sales information 
normal change change retail electricity sales million kwhs n a    hdd a cdd a a heating degree days hdd and cooling degree days cdd 
the operations of the distribution companies are weather sensitive 
weather conditions directly influence the volume of electricity delivered by the distribution companies  representing one of several factors that impact the volume of electricity delivered 
accordingly  deviations in weather from normal levels can affect allegheny s financial performance 
degree day data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable 
table of contents indoor temperature levels based on each day s average temperature 
hdd is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below fahrenheit  and cdd is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above fahrenheit 
each degree of temperature above fahrenheit is counted as one cooling degree day  and each degree of temperature below fahrenheit is counted as one heating degree day 
hdd and cdd are most likely to impact the usage of allegheny s residential and commercial customers 
industrial customers are less weather sensitive 
the generation and marketing segment allegheny monitors the financial and operating performance of its generation and marketing segment using a number of indicators and performance statistics  including the following kwhs generated 
this is a measure of the total physical quantity of electricity generated and is monitored at the individual generating unit level  as well as by various unit groupings 
equivalent availability factor eaf 
the eaf measures the percentage of time that a given amount of mws from a generation unit is available to generate electricity if called upon in the marketplace 
a unit s availability is commonly less than  primarily as a result of scheduled outages for planned maintenance or unplanned outages and derates 
the eaf is calculated based upon availability data reported to ferc and pjm 
allegheny monitors the eaf by individual unit  as well as by various unit groupings 
one such grouping is all supercritical units 
a supercritical unit utilizes steam pressure in excess of  pounds per square inch  which enables these units to be larger and more efficient than other generation units 
fort martin  harrison  hatfield s ferry and pleasants are supercritical generation facilities that have supercritical units 
these units generally operate at high capacity for extended periods of time 
station operations and maintenance costs station o m 
station o m includes base  operations and special maintenance costs 
base and operations costs consist of normal recurring expenses related to the on going operation of the generation facility 
special maintenance costs include costs associated with outage related maintenance and projects that relate to all of the generation facilities 
kwhs generated  eaf and station o m 
the following table shows kwhs generated  excluding kwhs consumed by pumping at the bath county  virginia hydroelectric station  eafs and station o m related to the generation and marketing segment change change supercritical units kwhs generated in millions eaf station o m in millions base and operations special maintenance total station o m all generation units kwhs generated in millions eaf station o m in millions base and operations special maintenance total station o m 
table of contents primary factors affecting allegheny s performance the principal business  economic and other factors that affect allegheny s operations and financial performance include rate regulation and other regulatory policies  plant availability  capacity  dispatch and maintenance  weather conditions  demand and market prices for power  cost of fuel  including but not limited to the cost of both natural gas and coal and emission allowances and the lime  urea and other materials necessary for the functioning of certain pollution controls  wholesale commodity and capacity prices  pjm market  rules and policies  availability and access to liquidity and changes in interest rates  environmental compliance costs and related capital expenditures and labor costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the areas described in this section require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
further discussion of the application of these accounting policies can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition allegheny follows the accrual method of accounting for revenues and recognizes revenue for electricity that has been delivered to customers but not yet billed through the end of its accounting period 
unbilled revenues are primarily associated with the distribution companies 
energy sales to individual customers are based on their meter readings  which are performed periodically on a systematic basis 
at the end of each month  the amount of energy delivered to each customer after the last meter reading is estimated  and the distribution companies recognize unbilled revenues related to these estimated amounts 
a provision for uncollectible amounts is recorded as a component of operations and maintenance expense 
the unbilled revenue estimates are based on daily generation  purchases of electricity  estimated customer usage by customer type  weather effects  electric line losses and the most recent consumer rates 
regulatory accounting the distribution companies  trail company and path  llc are subject to regulations that set the rates that they are permitted to charge customers 
these rates are based on costs that the applicable regulatory agencies determine that the distribution companies  trail company and path  llc are permitted to recover 
at times  regulators permit the future recovery through rates of incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense by an unregulated company 
at times  regulators may also allow the collection of amounts in rates for costs expected to be incurred in the future or may require that amounts collected be set aside for a specific purpose or be credited or refunded to customers in the future 
this ratemaking process often results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities based on estimated future cash inflows and outflows under regulatory guidelines and orders 
allegheny regularly reviews its regulatory assets and liabilities  including the estimates and assumptions on which they have been recorded and related regulatory interpretations 
excess of cost over net assets acquired goodwill recorded goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  and more frequently upon indication of possible impairment 
the first phase of a goodwill impairment 
table of contents test involves comparison of reporting unit fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit that has been assigned goodwill 
this testing requires the use of estimates  assumptions and other inputs to determine the fair value of reporting units using both a discounted cash flow approach and a market based valuation approach 
these estimates  assumptions and other inputs involve the use of judgment  and changes in these inputs can significantly impact the estimated reporting unit fair value 
allegheny s estimated reporting unit fair values at each testing date during through exceeded the reporting unit carrying values by a significant margin 
depreciation depreciation expense is determined generally on a straight line group method over the estimated service lives of depreciable assets for unregulated operations 
for regulated utility operations  depreciation expense is determined using a straight line group method in accordance with currently enacted regulatory rates 
under the straight line group method  plant components are categorized as retirement units or minor items of property 
as retirement units are replaced  the cost of the replacement is capitalized and the original component is retired 
replacements of minor items of property are expensed as maintenance 
long lived asset impairment review allegheny s consolidated balance sheets include significant long lived assets that are not subject to recovery under sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  sfas 
allegheny s long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through operations 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the expected undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset  an impairment loss is recognized  and the asset is written down to its fair value 
allegheny did not record any impairment charges during and derivative contracts derivative contracts are recorded in allegheny s consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in the fair value of the derivative contract included in revenues or expenses on the consolidated statements of income unless the derivative falls within the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas or is designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes 
the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception requires  among other things  physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business 
contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are accounted for under accrual accounting and  therefore  are not recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
for certain transactions that are designed to hedge the cash flows of a forecasted transaction  the effective portion of the hedge is recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction is completed or settled 
changes in any ineffective portion of the hedge are immediately recognized in earnings 
fair values for exchange traded instruments  principally futures and certain options  are based on actively quoted market prices 
fair values are subject to change in the near term and reflect management s best estimate based on various factors 
in establishing the fair value of commodity contracts that do not have quoted prices  such as physical contracts and ftrs  over the counter options and swaps  management uses available market data and pricing models to estimate fair values 
estimating the fair values of instruments that do not have quoted market prices requires management s judgment in determining amounts that could reasonably be expected to be received from  or paid to  a third party in settlement of the instruments 
these amounts could be materially different from amounts that might be realized in an actual sale transaction 
allegheny has netting agreements with various counterparties 
these agreements provide the right to set off amounts due from or to the counterparty 
in cases in which these netting agreements are in place  allegheny records the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities and of accounts receivable and accounts payable with each counterparty on a net basis 
in addition  ftr assets and obligations are recorded on a net basis 
cash flows associated with derivative contracts are recorded in cash flows from operating activities 
see note  fair value measurements  derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding energy transaction activities 

table of contents income taxes allegheny is subject to income taxes in the united states and in various state jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining the provisions for income taxes 
allegheny establishes reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
allegheny adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of tax audits 
effective january   allegheny adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which prescribes an approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
see note  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
stock based compensation allegheny accounts for stock based compensation under the provisions of sfas no 
r accounting for stock based compensation  sfas r 
share based payments are generally measured at fair value on the date of grant and are expensed over the requisite service period 
the determination of grant date fair value requires the use of judgment based on historical information as well as future expectations 
in addition  the estimates of stock based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and actual results or updated estimates may differ from current estimates 
see note  stock based compensation to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions there are a number of significant estimates and assumptions involved in determining allegheny s pension and other postretirement benefit opeb obligations and costs each period  such as employee demographics  discount rates  expected rates of return on plan assets  estimated rates of future compensation increases  medical inflation and the fair value of plan assets 
changes made to provisions for pension or other postretirement benefit plans may also affect current and future pension and opeb costs 
allegheny believes that its assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections  and its projections are reviewed annually with an outside actuarial firm 
see note  pension benefits and postretirement benefits other than pensions to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning these assumptions 
allegheny determines its discount rate assumptions through the use of a cash flow matching process in which the timing and amount of estimated benefit cash flows for each benefit plan are matched with an interest rate curve applicable to the returns of high quality corporate bonds over the expected benefit payment period to determine an overall effective discount rate 
the interest rate curve used in this process is based primarily on the citigroup pension discount curve and the citigroup above median pension discount curve 
allegheny s general approach for determining the overall expected long term rate of return on assets considers historical and expected future asset returns  the current and future targeted asset mix of the plan assets  historical and future expected real rates of return for equities and fixed income securities and historical and expected inflation statistics 
the following table shows the effect that a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate on plan assets for would have on allegheny s pension and opeb obligations and costs in millions percentage point increase percentage point decrease change in the discount rate pension and opeb obligation net periodic pension and opeb cost change in expected rate of return on plan assets net periodic pension and opeb cost contingencies allegheny regularly reviews and assesses the likelihood of losses relating to environmental  legal and other contingencies and accrues a liability for matters for which it believes that a loss is probable if the probable loss can be estimated

construction and capital requirements allegheny estimates that its cash based capital expenditures will approximate  million in and  million in  including amounts relating to significant multiple year environmental control and transmission expansion projects 
significant ongoing capital projects at allegheny are described below 
see business capital expenditures for additional capital expenditure detail 
trail in june  the board of directors of pjm approved a new transmission line and designated allegheny to build the allegheny power zone portion of the line 
pjm  which is a regional transmission organization  is responsible for the operation of  and reliability planning for  the transmission network in the pjm region and included the new line in its regional transmission expansion plan 
in october  allegheny formed trail company as the entity responsible for financing  constructing  owning  operating and maintaining the new line  which is named the trans allegheny interstate line  or trail 
trail is a kv high voltage line that currently is to extend from southwestern pennsylvania through west virginia to a point of interconnection with virginia electric and power company dominion in northern virginia 
in addition  trail company and dominion will jointly own a mile kv portion of the line  which dominion will construct in virginia 
the overall project has a targeted completion date of cost estimates for allegheny s portion of the trail project are approximately million  of which approximately million had been incurred through december  in august  trail company entered into a million senior secured credit facility in connection with this project 
path in june  the board of pjm directed the construction of path  a high voltage transmission line project that originally was proposed to include approximately miles of kv transmission line from aep s substation near st 
albans  west virginia to allegheny s bedington substation near martinsburg  west virginia  and approximately miles of twin circuit kv lines from bedington to a new substation to be built and 
table of contents owned by allegheny near kemptown  maryland 
in september  allegheny and aep formed path  llc to construct and operate path 
path  llc is a series limited liability company 
the west virginia series is owned equally by allegheny and a subsidiary of aep 
the allegheny series is owned by allegheny 
on october   pjm announced a reconfiguration of path 
the reconfiguration is a result of constraints identified from comprehensive siting studies  interaction with government agencies  public input and a desire to identify a solution that reduces line mileage and minimizes the impact on communities and the environment 
the new configuration will consist of a single kv line from the aep substation near st 
albans  west virginia to a new substation near kemptown  maryland  eliminate the connection with the bedington substation and the twin circuit kv lines from bedington to kemptown  and include a new midpoint substation in west virginia in the vicinity of eastern grant county  northern hardy county  or southern hampshire county 
pjm has confirmed that the reconfigured project addresses its reliability concerns 
on october   pjm released the results of studies that change the required in service date for path to june total project costs of the west virginia series are expected to be approximately billion 
total project costs of the allegheny series are expected to be approximately billion 
allegheny anticipates funding its capital expenditures related to path with external debt financings and cash from operations 
scrubbers during  allegheny began construction of scrubbers at both its fort martin and hatfield s ferry generation facilities 
the scrubbers are expected to be placed into service during the total project costs for the scrubbers at fort martin and hatfield s ferry are estimated to be approximately million and million  respectively 
allegheny is funding million of construction costs associated with the construction of the scrubbers at fort martin with proceeds from the environmental control bonds issued in april  which securitized the environmental control surcharge that monongahela and potomac edison charge their west virginia customers

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during  allegheny continued its focus on managing risk  optimizing the value of its generation facilities and prudently managing and protecting the value associated with its wholesale energy markets transactions portfolio 
allegheny remains exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
the commodity price risk exposure results from market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity  coal  natural gas and other energy related commodities 
the interest rate risk exposure results from changes in interest rates related to variable rate debt and debt that is maturing and is refinanced 
allegheny has a program designed to systematically identify  measure  evaluate and actively manage and report market risks 
allegheny s corporate risk policy was adopted by its board of directors and is monitored by a risk management committee  which is chaired by its chief executive officer or his designee and is composed of senior management 
an independent risk management group within allegheny measures and monitors the risk exposures to ensure compliance with the policy and to ensure that the policy is periodically reviewed 
to manage the financial exposure to commodity price fluctuations in its wholesale transactions portfolio  fuel procurement  power marketing  natural gas supply and risk management activities  allegheny enters into contracts  such as electricity  coal and natural gas purchase and sale commitments  to hedge the risk exposure 
however  allegheny does not hedge the entire exposure of its operations from commodity price volatility for a variety of reasons 
to the extent allegheny does not hedge against commodity price volatility  its consolidated results of operations  cash flows and consolidated financial position may be affected either favorably or unfavorably by a shift in the forward price curves and spot commodity prices 
allegheny enters into certain contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity 
certain of these contracts are recorded at their fair value and are an economic hedge for the generation facilities 
for accounting purposes  the generation facilities are recorded at historical cost less depreciation 
as a result  allegheny s results of operations and financial position can be favorably or unfavorably affected by a change in forward market prices 
of its commodity driven risks  allegheny is primarily exposed to risks associated with the wholesale electricity markets  including generation  coal and other fuel procurement  power marketing and the purchase and sale of electricity 
allegheny s wholesale activities principally consist of bilateral forward contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity 
the majority of these contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell electricity at fixed prices in the future 
these forward contracts can require either physical or financial settlement 
at december   ae s outstanding debt subject to variable interest rates was million  compared to million of outstanding debt subject to variable interest rates at december  accordingly  a one percent increase in the variable interest rate under ae s and ae supply s current credit facilities would increase allegheny s projected interest expense in by approximately million for outstanding debt  on an annual basis  based on the amount of outstanding debt as of december  see note  capitalization and short term debt  to the consolidated financial statements 
credit risk credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty to a transaction will be unable to fulfill its contractual obligations 
allegheny evaluates the credit standing of a prospective counterparty based on the prospective counterparty s financial condition 
where deemed necessary  allegheny may impose specified collateral requirements and use standardized agreements that facilitate netting of cash flows 
allegheny monitors the financial conditions of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis 
allegheny s independent risk management group oversees credit risk 

table of contents allegheny engages in various energy transacting activities 
the counterparties to these transactions generally include electric and natural gas utilities  independent power producers  energy marketers and commercial and industrial customers 
in the event the counterparties do not fulfill their obligations  allegheny may incur a loss to close out a position 
allegheny has a concentration of counterparties in the electric and natural gas utility industries 
this concentration of counterparties may affect allegheny s overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  because these counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
allegheny is dependent on coal for much of its electric generation capacity 
allegheny has coal supply contracts in place that partially mitigate its exposure to negative fluctuations in coal prices 
however  allegheny can provide no assurance that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply coal 
the suppliers under these agreements may  as a general matter  experience financial  legal or technical problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations 
among other circumstances  the prevailing constrained credit markets and overall negative economic conditions may affect the ability of allegheny s suppliers to access the capital markets and maintain adequate liquidity to sustain their respective businesses 
various industry and operational factors  including increased costs  transportation constraints  safety issues and operational difficulties may have negative effects on coal supplier performance 
during periods of rising coal prices  the factors impacting supplier performance could have a more pronounced financial impact 
furthermore  the suppliers under these agreements may not be required to supply coal to allegheny under certain circumstances  such as in the event of a natural disaster 
if allegheny is unable to obtain its coal requirements under these contracts  it may be required to purchase coal at higher prices 
in addition  although these agreements generally contain specified prices  they also provide for price adjustments related to changes in specified cost indices  as well as specific events  such as changes in regulations affecting the coal industry 
changes in the supply and price of coal could have a material adverse effect on allegheny s business  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
as of december   allegheny s derivatives are comprised primarily of commodity hedges that will expire through may allegheny currently is involved in a number of capital intensive projects  including the trail project  the path project and the installation of scrubbers at the fort martin and hatfield s ferry generation facilities 
allegheny has contracted  or expects to contract  with specialized vendors to acquire some of the necessary materials and construction related services in order to complete these projects 
as such  allegheny is exposed to the risk that these contractors may not perform as required under their contracts 
should this occur  allegheny may be forced to find alternate arrangements  which may cause delay and or increased costs 
furthermore  allegheny can provide no assurance that it would be able to make such alternate arrangements on terms acceptable to it or at all 
allegheny also may be subject to credit risk through its participation in pjm  to the extent that pjm socializes counterparty defaults across pjm members 
wholesale credit risk we measure wholesale credit risk as the replacement cost for derivatives in power and natural gas excluding ftrs both mark to market and accrual adjusted for amounts owed to or due from counterparties for settled transactions 
the replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains  net of any unrealized losses  where we have a legally enforceable right of setoff 
we monitor and manage the credit risk of our wholesale marketing  risk management  and energy transacting operation through credit policies and procedures which include an established credit approval process  daily monitoring of counterparty credit limits  the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin  collateral  and the use of master netting agreements 

table of contents as of december  and  the credit portfolio of our wholesale marketing  risk management  and energy transacting operation had the following public credit ratings rating investment grade a non investment grade non rated a includes counterparties with an investment grade rating by at least one of the major credit rating agencies 
if split rating exists  the lower rating is used 
a portion of our total wholesale credit risk is related to transactions that are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
these transactions primarily consist of open positions from our wholesale marketing  risk management  and energy transacting operations that are accounted for using derivative accounting  as well as amounts owed by wholesale counterparties for transactions that settled but have not yet been paid 
the following table highlights the credit quality and exposures related to these activities  excluding ftrs  at december  dollar amounts in millions total exposure before collateral collateral net exposure number of counterparties with greater than of net exposure net exposure of counterparties with greater than of net exposure rating investment grade non investment grade not rated total due to the possibility of extreme volatility in the prices of energy commodities and derivatives  the market value of contractual positions with individual counterparties could exceed established credit limits or collateral provided by those counterparties 
if such a counterparty were then to fail to perform its obligations under its contract for example  by failing to deliver the electricity our wholesale marketing  risk management  and energy transacting operation had contracted for  we could incur a loss that could have a material impact on our financial results 
market risk market risk arises from the potential for changes in the value of energy related to price and volatility in the market 
allegheny reduces these risks by using its generation assets to back positions on physical transactions 
allegheny monitors market risk exposure and credit risk limits within the guidelines of its corporate risk business practices 
allegheny evaluates commodity price risk  operational risk and credit risk in establishing the fair value of commodity contracts 
allegheny and ae supply use various methods to measure their exposure to market risk on a daily basis  including a value at risk model var 
var is a statistical model that measures the variability of value and predicts the risk of loss based on historical market price and volatility data over a given period of time 
the quantification of market risk using var provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors to set the overall corporate risk tolerance  determine risk targets and monitor positions 
allegheny and ae supply calculate var using the monte carlo technique by simulating thousands of scenarios sampling from the probability distribution of uncertain market variables 
in addition to var  allegheny and ae supply routinely perform stress and scenario analyses to measure extreme losses due to exceptional events 
also  var models are back tested to provide reasonable assurance of accuracy and reliability 

table of contents ae supply calculated the var of a day holding period at a confidence level using the full term of all remaining wholesale energy market positions that are accounted for on a marked to market basis 
these wholesale energy market positions consist of derivatives in power and natural gas excluding ftrs 
the ftrs are excluded from the var measurement as they are generally considered as the economic hedges that serve allegheny s load obligation 
as of december  and december   this calculation yielded a var of million and  respectively 
this var increase is primarily due to the increase in the transactions being accounted for on a mark to market basis as described in note fair value measurements  derivative instruments and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements 
the value of ftrs generally represents an economic hedge of future congestion charges incurred to serve allegheny s load obligations 
the related load obligations  however  are not reflected in allegheny s consolidated balance sheets 
as a result  the timing of recognition of gains or losses on ftrs will differ from the timing of power purchases  including incurred congestion charges 
the fair value of ftrs has been determined using an internal model based on data from pjm annual and monthly ftr auctions 
these monthly auction results can change significantly over time and may differ from the final settlement amounts 
as described in note fair value measurements  derivative instruments and hedging activities  allegheny recorded million in unrealized losses attributable to ftrs during the twelve months ended december
