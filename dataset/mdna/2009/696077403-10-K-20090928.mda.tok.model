item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements filed as part of this annual report 
critical accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we believe that our accounting policies and estimates relating to revenue recognition  accrued expenses and stock based compensation charges are the most critical 
revenue recognition revenue from corporate collaborations and licensing agreements consists of up front fees  research and development funding and milestone payments 
non refundable up front fees are deferred and amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over the related performance period 
we estimate the performance period as the period in which we perform certain development activities under the applicable agreement 
reimbursements for research and development activities are recorded in the period that we perform the related activities under the terms of the applicable agreements 
revenue resulting from the achievement of milestone events stipulated in the applicable agreements is recognized when the milestone is achieved  provided that such milestone is substantive in nature 
the million upfront payment received in january under the astrazeneca agreement has been deferred and is being recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the maximum period during which we may perform research services under the agreement 
if our estimated period of performance is reduced to less than the maximum  the amortization period for any remaining deferred revenue will also be reduced 
in  we entered into a collaborative development and marketing agreement with king pharmaceuticals  inc king to jointly develop and commercialize bremelanotide  which agreement was terminated effective 
table of contents december deferred revenue related to the king agreement had been recognized as revenue over the estimated period of our performance during the initial development term of this agreement 
in connection with the termination of the agreement  we recognized as revenue in our fiscal year ended june  all remaining deferred up front license fees received from king  together with associated deferred costs  in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
accrued expenses a significant portion of our development activities are performed by third parties 
we review the activities performed under significant contracts each quarter and accrue expenses and the amount of any reimbursement to be received from our collaborators based upon the estimated amount of work completed 
estimating the value or stage of completion of certain services requires judgment based on available information 
if we do not identify services performed for us but not billed by the service provider  or if we underestimate or overestimate the value of services performed as of a given date  reported expenses will be understated or overstated 
stock based compensation the fair value of stock options granted has been calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires us to make estimates of expected volatility and expected option lives 
we estimate these factors at the time of grant based on our own prior experience  public sources of information and information for comparable companies 
the amount of recorded compensation related to an option grant is not adjusted for subsequent changes in these estimates or for actual experience 
the amount of our recorded compensation is also dependent on our estimates of future option forfeitures and the probability of achievement of performance conditions 
if we initially over estimate future forfeitures  our reported expenses will be understated until such time as we adjust our estimate 
changes in estimated forfeitures will affect our reported expenses in the period of change and future periods 
the amount and timing of compensation expense to be recorded in future periods related to grants of restricted stock units may be affected by employment terminations 
as a result  stock based compensation charges may vary significantly from period to period 
results of operations year ended june  compared to the year ended june  revenue for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal  we recognized million in revenue compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal 
revenue consisted of the following fiscal fiscal revenue related to million million our license agreement with astrazeneca million bremelanotide for ed and fsd pursuant to our collaboration agreement with king  which was terminated effective december million neutrospec  pursuant to our collaboration agreement with mallinckrodt 
revenue from astrazeneca for fiscal and fiscal consists of million and million  respectively  of revenue related to our research services performed during those periods  and million and million  respectively  of revenue related to astrazeneca s up front license fee 
currently  the research services obligation under our agreement with astrazeneca expires in january  subject to renewal 
the fluctuation in revenue related to king reflects the recognition in fiscal of the remaining deferred license revenue pursuant to king s up front payment  based on the termination of our collaboration agreement with king 
contract revenue from mallinckrodt  with whom we have a strategic collaboration agreement to develop neutrospec  primarily reflects mallinckrodt s share of the costs incurred in neutrospec development activities 
there were no substantive development activities on neutrospec in fiscal  and we do not anticipate any substantive development activities on neutrospec in the fiscal year ending june   though the agreement with mallinckrodt has not been terminated 
future contract revenue from astrazeneca and mallinckrodt  in the form of reimbursement of shared development costs or the recognition of deferred license fees  will fluctuate based on development activities in our obesity and neutrospec programs 
we may also earn contract revenue based on the attainment of development milestones 
research and development research and development expenses decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease is the result of the restructuring of our clinical stage product portfolio and development programs and the reduction in workforce initiated in may 
table of contents research and development expenses related solely to bremelanotide for ed and fsd decreased approximately million  from million in fiscal to million for fiscal similar to the recognition of license revenue explained above  we recognized million in fiscal of recorded deferred costs based on the termination of our collaboration agreement with king 
research and development expenses related to our bremelanotide  pl  pl  obesity  neutrospec and other preclinical programs were million for both fiscal and fiscal spending to date has been primarily related to the identification and optimization of lead compounds  and secondarily to a study of the effects of melanocortin receptor specific compounds on food intake  obesity and other metabolic parameters and preclinical studies  a phase and a phase a trial with pl and additional preclinical studies and a phase trial with subcutaneously administered bremelanotide 
the amount of such spending and the nature of future development activities are dependent on a number of factors  including primarily the availability of funds to support future development activities  success of our clinical trial  preclinical and discovery programs  and our ability to progress compounds in addition to bremelanotide and pl into human clinical trials 
the historical amounts of project spending above exclude general research and development spending  which decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease is primarily related to the reduction in workforce initiated in may cumulative spending from inception to june  on our bremelanotide  neutrospec and other programs which includes pl  pl  obesity and other discovery programs amounts to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
due to various risk factors described in this annual report  including the difficulty in currently estimating the costs and timing of future phase clinical trials and larger scale phase and phase clinical trials for any product under development  we cannot predict with reasonable certainty when  if ever  a program will advance to the next stage of development or be successfully completed  or when  if ever  related net cash inflows will be generated 
see item a risk factors 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease is primarily related to the reduction in workforce initiated in may income tax benefit income tax benefits of million in fiscal and million in fiscal relate to the sale of new jersey state net operating loss carryforwards 
the amount of such losses and tax credits that we are able to sell depends on annual pools and allocations established by the state of new jersey 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have incurred net operating losses  primarily related to spending on our research and development programs 
we have financed our net operating losses primarily through equity financings and amounts received under collaborative agreements 
our product candidates are at various stages of development and will require significant further research  development and testing and some may never be successfully developed or commercialized 
we may experience uncertainties  delays  difficulties and expenses commonly experienced by early stage biopharmaceutical companies  which may include unanticipated problems and additional costs relating to the development and testing of products in animals and humans  product approval or clearance  regulatory compliance  good manufacturing practices  intellectual property rights  product introduction  marketing  sales and competition  and obtaining sufficient capital 
failure to obtain timely regulatory approval for our product candidates and indications would impact our ability to increase revenues and could make it more difficult to attract investment capital for funding our operations 
any of these possibilities could materially and adversely affect our operations and require us to curtail or cease certain programs 

table of contents during fiscal  we used million of cash for our operating activities  compared to million used in fiscal and million used in fiscal net cash outflows from operations in fiscal were favorably impacted by the decrease in research and development expenses and the receipt of million in additional payments from astrazeneca 
net cash outflows from operations in fiscal were favorably impacted by the receipt of an up front license payment of million from astrazeneca in january our periodic accounts receivable balances will continue to be highly dependent on the timing of receipts from collaboration partners and the division of development responsibilities between us and our collaboration partners 
in fiscal  net cash provided by investing activities was million  consisting mainly of the sale of property and equipment 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was million  consisting of million used for the acquisition of capital equipment and million used to purchase available for sale investments  compared to million used for the acquisition of capital equipment during fiscal for fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was million  consisting entirely of payments on capital lease obligations 
during fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was million  consisting of million in payments on capital lease obligations partially offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of common stock warrants 
during fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was million  primarily reflecting proceeds from the sale of common stock in a registered offering in february we have incurred cumulative negative cash flows from operations since our inception  and have expended  and expect to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to complete our planned product development efforts 
as of june   our cash and cash equivalents were million and our available for sale investments were million 
in august  we sold  units in a registered direct offering for gross proceeds of million 
each unit consisted of one share of common stock and a five year warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
net proceeds to us  after offering costs  amounted to approximately million 
in september  we signed an amendment to our collaboration agreement with astrazeneca which provides for million in payments to us  with an initial payment of million payable on signing and the balance payable in the first quarter of calendar we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments as of june   together with proceeds from the august registered direct offering  expected receipts from the september amendment to our astrazeneca agreement and other income  are adequate to fund operations through at least september  we will need additional funds to continue development of bremelanotide  pl and pl  as well as our early stage research and discovery programs  and to fund operations after that date 
we intend to seek additional capital through public or private equity financings  collaborative arrangements on our product candidates  milestone payments or other sources 
however  additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we will further curtail operations significantly  including the delay  modification or cancelation of product candidate development plans and further decreases in staffing levels 
we may also be required to seek collaborators for our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available  and relinquish  license or otherwise dispose of rights on unfavorable terms to technologies and product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
the nature and timing of our development activities are highly dependent on our financing activities 
no assurance can be given that we will earn future milestone payments that are contingent on specified events or that we will not consume a significant amount of our available resources before that time 
we plan to continue to monitor the progress of our development programs and the timing and amount of related expenditures and potential milestone receipts  refine our operations  control expenses  evaluate alternative methods to conduct our business and seek additional financing and sharing of development costs through strategic collaboration agreements or other resources 
we anticipate incurring additional losses over at least the next few years 
to achieve profitability  we  alone or with others  must successfully develop and commercialize our technologies and proposed products  conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials  obtain required regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and market such technologies and proposed products 
the time required to reach profitability is highly uncertain  and we do not know whether we will be able to achieve profitability on a sustained basis  if at all 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations we have entered into various contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the following table summarizes our most significant contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years facility operating leases    capital lease obligations    license agreements     total contractual obligations   our license agreements also include royalty and other contingent payment obligations and may be terminated by us under certain conditions 
our license agreements related to neutrospec require royalty payments on commercial net sales and payments of up to million contingent on the achievement of specified cumulative net margins on sales by mallinckrodt 
no contingent amounts will be payable related to neutrospec unless we recommence sales and marketing of neutrospec 
we do not expect to make any such contingent payments during the next twelve months
