item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report 
overview on august   cinemark holdings  inc was formed as the delaware holding company of cinemark  inc on august   the cinemark  inc stockholders entered into a share exchange agreement pursuant to which they agreed to exchange their shares of class a common stock for an equal number of shares of common stock of cinemark holdings  inc cinemark share exchange 
the cinemark share exchange was completed on october  and facilitated the acquisition of century theatres  inc century acquisition 
on october   cinemark  inc became a wholly owned subsidiary of cinemark holdings  inc prior to october   cinemark holdings  inc 
had no assets  liabilities or operations 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements are reflective of the change in reporting entity that occurred as a result of the cinemark share exchange 
cinemark holdings  inc s consolidated financial statements reflect the accounting basis of its stockholders for all periods presented 
on april   cinemark holdings  inc completed an initial public offering of its common stock 
as of december   we managed our business under two operating segments us markets and international markets  in accordance with sfas no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues and expenses we generate revenues primarily from box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising sales and other revenue streams  such as vendor marketing programs  pay phones  atm machines and electronic video games located in some of our theatres 
our investment in ncm has assisted us in expanding our offerings to advertisers  exploring ancillary revenue sources such as digital video monitor advertising  third party branding  and the use of theatres for non film events 
in addition  we are able to use theatres during non peak hours for concerts  sporting events  and other cultural events 
successful films released during the year ended december  included the dark knight  which grossed over million in domestic box office and broke several box office records  including the single day box office record on its opening day and the single film three day weekend record during its opening weekend  iron man and indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull  each of which grossed over million in domestic box office  hancock  wall e  and kung fu panda  which all grossed over million  and madagascar escape africa  horton hears a who  sex and the city  quantum of solace  twilight and mamma mia 
our revenues are affected by changes in attendance and average admissions and concession revenues per patron 
attendance is primarily affected by the quality and quantity of films released by motion picture studios 
films scheduled for release during include harry potter and the half blood prince  transformers revenge of the fallen  angels demons  x men origins wolverine  night at the museum ii escape from the smithsonian  and watchmen and d films such as monsters vs 
aliens  ice age dawn of the dinosaurs  avatar  a christmas carol  and disney s next pixar installment  up 
film rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues 
film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released 
film rental costs can also vary based on the length of a film s run 
film rental rates are negotiated on a film by film and theatre by theatre basis 
advertising costs  which are expensed as incurred  are primarily fixed at the theatre level as daily movie directories placed in newspapers represent the largest component of advertising costs 
the monthly cost of these advertisements is based on  among other things  the size of the directory and the frequency and size of the newspaper s circulation 
concession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues 
we purchase concession supplies to replace units sold 
we negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain bulk rates 
although salaries and wages include a fixed cost component ie the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non peak periods  salaries and wages move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to handle changes in attendance 
facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment 
certain of our leases are subject to percentage rent only while others are subject to 
table of contents percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved 
facility lease expense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases versus the number of theatres under capital leases and the number of fee owned theatres 
utilities and other costs include certain costs that are fixed such as property taxes  certain costs that are variable such as liability insurance  and certain costs that possess both fixed and variable components such as utilities  repairs and maintenance and security services 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies  which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results  include the following revenue and expense recognition revenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office 
other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising 
screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on screen or in theatre 
we record proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale type certificates in current liabilities and recognize admissions and concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate 
we recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates  based on historical experience  the likelihood of redemption is remote  and based on applicable laws and regulations 
in evaluating the likelihood of redemption  we consider the period outstanding  the level and frequency of activity  and the period of inactivity 
film rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either the mutually agreed upon firm terms or a sliding scale formula  which are established prior to the opening of the film  or estimates of the final mutually agreed upon settlement  which occurs at the conclusion of the film run  subject to the film licensing arrangement 
under a firm terms formula  we pay the distributor a mutually agreed upon specified percentage of box office receipts  which reflects either a mutually agreed upon aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run 
under the sliding scale formula  film rental is paid as a percentage of box office revenues using a pre determined matrix based upon box office performance of the film 
the settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs 
estimates are based on the expected success of a film over the length of its run in theatres 
the success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known 
accordingly  final settlements typically approximate estimates since box office receipts are known at the time the estimate is made and the expected success of a film over the length of its run in theatres can typically be estimated early in the film s run 
the final film settlement amount is negotiated at the conclusion of the film s run based upon how a film actually performs 
if actual settlements are different than those estimated  film rental costs are adjusted at that time 
we recognize advertising costs and any cost sharing arrangements with film distributors in the same accounting period 
our advertising costs are expensed as incurred 
facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment 
certain of our leases are subject to monthly percentage rent only  which is accrued each month based on actual revenues 
certain of our other theatres require payment of percentage rent in addition to fixed monthly rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved 
percentage rent expense is recorded for these theatres on a monthly basis if the theatre s historical performance or forecasted performance indicates that the annual target will be reached 
the estimate of percentage rent expense recorded during the year is based on a trailing twelve months of revenues 
once annual revenues are known  which is generally at the end of the year  the percentage rent expense is adjusted based on actual revenues 
theatre properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
in estimating the useful lives of our theatre properties and equipment  we have relied upon our experience with such assets and our historical replacement period 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary 
adjustments to the expected lives of assets are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
we assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets actual theatre level cash flows  future years budgeted theatre level cash flows  theatre property and equipment carrying values  amortizing intangible asset carrying values  the age of a recently built theatre  competitive theatres in the marketplace  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the impact of recent ticket price changes  available lease renewal options  and other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis  which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
the impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre s useful life 
the remainder of the useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period  which includes the probability of renewal periods for leased properties and a period of twenty years for fee owned properties 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long lived asset s carrying value  we then compare the carrying value of the asset group theatre with its estimated fair value 
fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows  which was eight times for the evaluations performed during  and the first  second and third quarters of and six and a half times for the evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of when estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group theatre  the asset group theatre is written down to its estimated fair value 
significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value 
management s estimates are based on historical and projected operating performance as well as recent market transactions 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill might exceed its estimated fair value 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value 
the evaluation is a two step approach requiring us to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment 
fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows  which was eight times for the goodwill impairment evaluations performed during and and six and a half times for the evaluation performed during significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value 
management s estimates are based on historical and projected operating performance as well as recent market transactions 
prior to january   we considered our theatres reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment 
recent changes in the organization  including changes in the structure of the executive management team  the initial public offering of common stock  the resulting changes in the level at which the management team evaluates the business on a regular basis  and the century acquisition that increased the size of the theatre base by approximately  led management to conclude that our us regions and international countries are now more reflective of how we manage and operate our business 
accordingly  the us regions and international countries represent the appropriate reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment 
consequently  effective january   management changed the reporting unit to sixteen regions in the us and each of eight countries internationally honduras  el salvador  nicaragua  costa rica and panama are considered one reporting unit from approximately four hundred theatres 
the goodwill impairment test performed during december that resulted in the recording of impairment charges during the year ended december  reflected the final calculation utilizing theatres as reporting units 

table of contents tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we estimate the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues  with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  the tradename intangible asset is written down to the estimated fair value 
acquisitions we account for acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the purchase method requires that we estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and allocate consideration paid accordingly 
for significant acquisitions  we obtain independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist us in determining fair value 
the estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded 
we provide the assumptions  including both quantitative and qualitative information  about the specified asset or liability to the third party valuation firms 
we primarily utilize the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained 
we then use that information to determine fair value 
the third party valuation firms are supervised by company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value 
we evaluate the appropriateness of the valuation methodology utilized by the third party valuation firm 
income taxes we use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested 
income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments 
the related tax accruals are recorded in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
fin  which we adopted on january  fin clarifies the accounting and reporting for income taxes recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and the recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin is a two step process 
the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we should presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in a change in a liability for income taxes payable or a change in an income tax refund receivable  a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both and 
we accrue for interest and penalties on our fin tax provisions 
recent developments on february   our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of per common share payable to stockholders of record on march  the dividend will be paid on march
