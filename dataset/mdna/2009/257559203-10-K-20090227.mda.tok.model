our raw materials the manufacturing of pulp and paper requires wood fiber  chemicals and energy 
we discuss below these three major raw materials used in our manufacturing operations 

table of contents wood fiber united states pulp and paper mills the fiber used by our pulp and paper mills in the united states is primarily hardwood and secondarily softwood  both being readily available in the market from multiple third party sources 
the mills obtain fiber from a variety of sources  depending on their location 
these sources include a combination of long term supply contracts  wood lot management arrangements  advance stumpage purchases and spot market purchases 
canadian pulp and paper mills the fiber used at our windsor pulp and paper mill is hardwood originating from a variety of sources  including purchases on the open market in canada and the united states  contracts with quebec wood producers marketing boards  public land where we have wood fiber harvesting rights and domtar s private lands 
our espanola pulp and paper mill and dryden pulp mill  which consume both hardwood and softwood  obtain fiber from third parties  directly or indirectly from public lands  either through designated wood harvesting rights for the pulp mills or from our ontario sawmills 
our dryden pulp mill was converted to a softwood pulp mill in january the fiber used at our kamloops pulp mill is all softwood  originating from third party sawmilling operations in the southern part of the british columbia interior 
cutting rights on public lands related to our pulp and paper mills in canada represent about million cubic meters of softwood and million cubic meters of hardwood  for a total of million cubic meters of wood per year 
access to harvesting of fiber on public lands in ontario and quebec is subject to review by the respective governmental authorities 
during  the cost of wood fiber relating to our papers business comprised approximately of the aggregate amount of cost of sales 
chemicals we use various chemical compounds in our pulp and paper manufacturing facilities that we purchase primarily on a central basis through contracts varying in general between one to twelve years in length to ensure product availability 
most of the contracts have pricing that fluctuates based on prevailing market conditions 
for pulp manufacturing  we use numerous chemicals including caustic soda  sodium chlorate  sulfuric acid  lime and peroxide 
for paper manufacturing  we also use several chemical products including starch  precipitated calcium carbonate  optical brighteners  dyes and aluminum sulfate 
during  the cost of chemicals relating to our papers business comprised approximately of the aggregate amount of cost of sales 
energy our operations consume substantial amounts of fuel including natural gas  fuel oil  coal and hog fuel as well as electricity 
we purchase substantial portions of the fuel we consume under supply contracts 
under most of these contracts  suppliers are committed to provide quantities within pre determined ranges that provide us with our needs for a particular type of fuel at a specific facility 
most of these contracts have pricing that fluctuates based on prevailing market conditions 
natural gas  fuel oil  coal and hog fuel are consumed primarily to produce steam that is used in the manufacturing process and  to a lesser extent  to provide direct heat to be used in the chemical recovery process 
about of the energy required to produce steam  which is all produced internally through power and recovery boilers  comes from renewable fuels such as bark and spent cooking liquor 
the remainder of the energy comes from purchased fossil fuels such as natural gas  oil and coal 
we own power generating assets  including steam turbines  at thirteen locations ashdown  dryden  espanola  hawesville  johnsonburg  kamloops  kingsport  nekoosa  plymouth  port huron  rothschild  windsor and woodland  as well as hydro assets at five locations espanola  gatineau  nekoosa  woodland and

table of contents distribution operations and we intend to subscribe to internationally recognized environmental management systems  namely iso our competition the markets in which our businesses operate are highly competitive with well established domestic and foreign manufacturers 
in the papers business  our paper production does not rely on proprietary processes or formulas  except in highly specialized papers or customized products 
in order to gain market share in uncoated freesheet  we compete primarily on the basis of product quality  breadth of offering  service solutions and competitively priced paper products 
we seek product differentiation through an extensive offering of high quality fsc certified paper products 
while we have a leading position in the north american uncoated freesheet market  we also compete with other paper grades  including coated freesheet and uncoated groundwood  and with electronic transmission and document storage alternatives 
as the use of these alternative products continues to grow  we continue to see a decrease in the overall demand for paper products or shifts from one type of paper to another 
all of our paper manufacturing facilities are located in the united states or in canada where we sell of our papers 
the five largest manufacturers of uncoated freesheet papers in north america represent approximately of the total production capacity 
on a global basis  there are hundreds of manufacturers that produce and sell uncoated freesheet papers  ten of which have an annual production capacity of over million tons 
the level of competitive pressures from foreign producers in the north american market is highly dependent upon exchange rates including the rate between the us dollar and the euro 
the market pulp we sell is either hardwood or softwood and  to a lesser extent  fluff pulp 
the pulp market is highly fragmented with many manufacturers competing worldwide  some of whom have lower operating costs than we do 
competition is primarily on the basis of access to low cost wood fiber  product quality and prices 
the pulp we sell is primarily slow growth northern bleached hardwood and softwood kraft  and we produce specialty engineered pulp grades with a pre determined mix of wood species that go into the making of all kinds of papers  from business to specialty papers 
we also seek product differentiation through the certification of our pulp mills to the fsc chain of custody standard and the procurement of fsc certified virgin fiber 
all of our market pulp production capacity is located in the united states or in canada and we sell of our pulp overseas 
in wood  we sell primarily kiln dried softwood lumber and other value added products 
we are the th largest producer of lumber in north america  based on production capacity  with a production capacity of mfbm and our competitors include other major lumber producers  most of which are located in eastern canada 
competition is primarily on the basis of access to low cost fiber  service and prices 
all of our lumber production capacity is located in canada and we sell of our lumber to the united states 
as a result  we have exposure to currency fluctuations and are potentially subject to softwood lumber export taxes 
our employees we have approximately  employees  of which approximately are employed in the united states and in canada 
approximately of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  generally on a facility by facility basis  which will expire between and during  we signed a four year umbrella agreement with the united steelworkers union  affecting approximately  employees at our us locations 
this agreement only covers certain economic elements  and all other contract issues will be negotiated at each operating location  as the related collective bargaining agreements become subject to renewal

compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in the operation of our business 
we may encounter situations in which our operations fail to maintain full compliance with applicable environmental requirements  possibly leading to civil or criminal fines  penalties or enforcement actions  including those that could result in governmental or judicial orders that stop or interrupt our operations or require us to take corrective measures at substantial costs  such as the installation of additional pollution control equipment or other remedial actions 
compliance with us federal  state and local and canadian federal and provincial environmental laws and regulations involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs

table of contents item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information presented in this annual report on form k 
some of the following risks relate principally to the company s business and the industry in which it operates  while others relate principally to the transaction 
risks to the industries and businesses of the company the pulp  paper and wood product industries are highly cyclical 
fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for the company s products could result in smaller profit margins and lower sales volumes 
the pulp  paper and wood product industries are highly cyclical 
historically  economic and market shifts  fluctuations in capacity and changes in foreign currency exchange rates have created cyclical changes in prices  sales volume and margins for the company s products 
the length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product  but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity 
most of the company s paper products are commodities that are widely available from other producers 
even the company s non commodity products  such as value added papers  are susceptible to commodity dynamics 
because commodity products have few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer  competition for these products is based primarily on price  which is determined by supply relative to demand 
the overall levels of demand for the products the company manufactures and distributes  and consequently its sales and profitability  reflect fluctuations in levels of end user demand  which depend in part on general macroeconomic conditions in north america and worldwide  as well as competition from electronic substitution 
see conditions in the global capital and credit markets  and the economy generally  can adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial position and some of the company s products are vulnerable to long term declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 
for example  demand for cut size office paper may fluctuate with levels of white collar employment 
demand for many such products is currently being negatively impacted by the global economic downturn 
industry supply of pulp  paper and wood products is also subject to fluctuation  as changing industry conditions can influence producers to idle or permanently close individual machines or entire mills 
such closures can result in significant cash and or non cash charges 
in addition  to avoid substantial cash costs in connection with idling or closing a mill  some producers will choose to continue to operate at a loss  sometimes even a cash loss  which could prolong weak pricing environments due to oversupply 
oversupply can also result from producers introducing new capacity in response to favorable short term pricing trends 
industry supply of pulp  paper and wood products is also influenced by overseas production capacity  which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow 
as a result  prices for all of the company s products are driven by many factors outside of its control  and it has little influence over the timing and extent of price changes  which are often volatile 
because market conditions beyond the company s control determine the prices for its commodity products  the price for any one or more of these products may fall below its cash production costs  requiring the company to either incur cash losses on product sales or cease production at one or more of its manufacturing facilities 
the company continues to evaluate potential adjustments to its production capacity  which may include additional closures of machines or entire mills  and the company could recognize significant cash and or non cash charges relating to any such closures in future periods 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  under restructuring activities 
therefore  the company s profitability with respect to these products depends on managing its cost structure  particularly wood fiber  chemical and energy costs  which represent the largest components of its operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond its control  as described below 
if the prices of or demand for its products decline  or if its wood fiber  chemical or energy costs increase  or both  its sales and profitability could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents conditions in the global capital and credit markets and the economy generally can adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial position 
the company s sales and profitability have been adversely affected by recent adverse changes in general economic conditions 
the global capital and credit markets are currently undergoing a period of unprecedented contraction 
the company has exposure to counterparties with which we routinely execute transactions 
such counterparties include commercial banks  insurance companies and other financial institutions  some of which may be exposed to bankruptcy or liquidity risks 
while the company has not realized any significant losses to date  a bankruptcy or illiquidity event by one of our significant counterparties may materially and adversely affect our access to capital  future business and results of operations 
in addition  the global economy is undergoing a severe economic slowdown 
this is resulting in reduced demand for our products and may adversely affect the ability of some of our customers and suppliers to continue to operate their businesses 
continuation of these financial and economic conditions is likely to continue to adversely affect our operations  results of operations and financial position 
some of the company s products are vulnerable to long term declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 
the company s business competes with electronic transmission and document storage alternatives  as well as with paper grades it does not produce  such as uncoated groundwood 
as a result of such competition  the company has experienced decreased demand for some of its existing pulp and paper products 
as the use of these alternatives grows  demand for pulp and paper products is likely to further decline 
moreover  demand for some of the company s wood products may decline if customers purchase alternative products 
the company faces intense competition in its markets  and the failure to compete effectively would have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the company competes with both us and canadian paper producers and  for many of its product lines  global producers  some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than the company 
the principal basis for competition is selling price 
the company s ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on its ability to control its costs 
the company cannot assure you that it can compete effectively and maintain current levels of sales and profitability 
if the company cannot compete effectively  such failure will have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the company s manufacturing businesses may have difficulty obtaining wood fiber at favorable prices  or at all 
wood fiber is the principal raw material used by the company  comprising approximately of the aggregate amount of cost of sales during wood fiber is a commodity  and prices historically have been cyclical 
the primary source for wood fiber is timber 
environmental litigation and regulatory developments  alternative use for energy production and reduction in harvesting related to the housing market  have caused  and may cause in the future  significant reductions in the amount of timber available for commercial harvest in the united states and canada 
in addition  future domestic or foreign legislation and litigation concerning the use of timberlands  the protection of endangered species  the promotion of forest health and the response to and prevention of catastrophic wildfires could also affect timber supplies 
availability of harvested timber may be further limited by fire  insect infestation  disease  ice storms  wind storms  flooding and other natural and man made causes  thereby reducing supply and increasing prices 
wood fiber pricing is subject to regional market influences  and the company s cost of wood fiber may increase in particular regions due to market shifts in those regions 
any sustained increase in wood fiber prices would increase the company s operating costs  and the company may be unable to increase prices for its products in response to increased wood fiber costs due to additional factors affecting the demand or supply of these products 
the company currently obtains its wood fiber requirements in part by harvesting timber pursuant to its forest licenses and forest management agreements  in part by purchasing wood fiber from weyerhaeuser 
table of contents pursuant to the fiber and pulp supply agreements entered into in connection with the transaction  which expire between and  and in part by purchasing wood fiber from third parties 
if the company s cutting rights  pursuant to its forest licenses or forest management agreements  are reduced or if weyerhaeuser or any third party supplier of wood fiber stops selling or is unable to sell wood fiber to the company  its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
an increase in the cost of the company s purchased energy or chemicals would lead to higher manufacturing costs  thereby reducing its margins 
the company s operations consume substantial amounts of energy such as electricity  natural gas  fuel oil  coal and hog fuel 
energy comprised approximately of the aggregate amount of cost of sales in energy prices  particularly for electricity  natural gas and fuel oil  have been volatile in recent years 
as a result  fluctuations in energy prices will impact the company s manufacturing costs and contribute to earnings volatility 
while the company purchases substantial portions of its energy under supply contracts  most of these contracts are based on market pricing 
other raw materials the company uses include various chemical compounds  such as precipitated calcium carbonate  sodium chlorate and sodium hydroxide  sulfuric acid  dyes  peroxide  methanol and aluminum sulfate 
purchases of chemicals comprised approximately of the aggregate amount of cost of sales in the costs of these chemicals have been volatile historically  and are influenced by capacity utilization  energy prices and other factors beyond the company s control 
due to the commodity nature of the company s products  the relationship between industry supply and demand for these products  rather than solely changes in the cost of raw materials  will determine the company s ability to increase prices 
consequently  the company may be unable to pass on increases in its operating costs to its customers 
any sustained increase in chemical or energy prices without any corresponding increase in product pricing would reduce the company s operating margins and may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the company could experience disruptions in operations and or increased labor costs due to labor disputes or restructuring activities 
employees at of the company s facilities  a majority of the company s  employees  are represented by unions through collective bargaining agreements  generally on a facility by facility basis  which will expire between and currently  eight collective bargaining agreements are up for renegotiation of which only six are currently under negotiation 
the company may not be able to negotiate acceptable new collective bargaining agreements  which could result in strikes or work stoppages or other labor disputes by affected workers 
renewal of collective bargaining agreements could also result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members 
in addition  labor organizing activities could occur at any of the company s facilities 
therefore  the company could experience a disruption of its operations or higher ongoing labor costs  which could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition 
in connection with the company s restructuring efforts  the company has suspended operations at  or closed or announced its intention to close  various facilities and may incur liability with respect to affected employees  which could have a material adverse effect on its business or financial condition 
in addition  the company continues to evaluate potential adjustments to its production capacity  which may include additional closures of machines or entire mills  and the company could recognize significant cash and or non cash charges relating to any such closures in the future 
in the early part of  weyerhaeuser closed its pulp and paper mill in prince albert  saskatchewan  which the company acquired in the transaction  which remains closed 
certain unionized parties filed a grievance against weyerhaeuser following the shut down  alleging that certain post closure actions taken by 
table of contents weyerhaeuser violated their collective bargaining agreement 
in particular  the union disputed weyerhaeuser s post closure contracting with a third party vendor to oversee on site security at prince albert 
in connection with the transaction  the company has assumed any liability with respect to this grievance 
the grievance proceeded to an arbitration hearing and was dismissed by the arbitrator 
on application for judicial review  the arbitrator s decision was upheld by the saskatchewan court of queen s bench and  on february   by the saskatchewan court of appeal 
the company has not determined whether this facility will be reopened  sold or closed 
in a separate grievance related to the closure of the prince albert facility  which could result in liability in excess of million  the union is claiming that it is entitled to the accumulated pension benefits during the actual layoff period because  according to the union  a majority of employees retained still had recall rights during the layoff 
the company is currently evaluating its position with respect to these grievances and cannot be certain that it will not incur liability  which could be material  with respect to these grievances 
the company relies heavily on a small number of significant customers  including one customer that represented approximately of the company s sales in a loss of any of these significant customers could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company heavily relies on a small number of significant customers 
the company s largest customer represented approximately of the company s sales in a significant reduction in sales to any of the company s key customers  which could be due to factors outside its control  such as purchasing diversification or financial difficulties experienced by these customers  could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
a material disruption at one or more of the company s manufacturing facilities could prevent it from meeting customer demand  reduce its sales and or negatively impact its net income 
any of the company s pulp or paper manufacturing facilities  or any of its machines within an otherwise operational facility  could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events  including unscheduled maintenance outages  prolonged power failures  equipment failure  chemical spill or release  explosion of a boiler  the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply  labor difficulties  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure  including roads  bridges  railroad tracks and tunnels  fires  floods  earthquakes  hurricanes or other catastrophes  terrorism or threats of terrorism  or other operational problems  including those resulting from the risks described in this section 
events such as those listed above have resulted in operating losses in the past 
future events may cause shutdowns  which may result in additional downtime and or cause additional damage to the company s facilities 
any such downtime or facility damage could prevent the company from meeting customer demand for its products and or require it to make unplanned capital expenditures 
if one or more of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime  it may have a material adverse effect on the company financial results and financial position 

table of contents the company s substantial indebtedness  which is approximately billion as of december   could adversely affect its financial condition and impair its ability to operate its business 
as of december   the company had approximately billion of outstanding indebtedness  including million of indebtedness under its senior secured credit facilities  million of capital leases and billion of unsecured long term notes 
the company s substantial degree of indebtedness could have important consequences to the company s financial condition  operating results and business  including the following it may limit the company s ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital  capital expenditures  product development  debt service requirements  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  a substantial portion of the company s cash flows from operations will be dedicated to payments on its indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes  including operations  capital expenditures and future business opportunities  the debt service requirements of the company s indebtedness could make it more difficult for the company to satisfy its other obligations  the company s borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest  exposing the company to increased debt service obligations in the event of increased interest rates  it may limit the company s ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt  and it may increase the company s vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in its business  and may make the company unable to carry out capital spending that is important to its growth 
in addition  we are subject to agreements that require us to meet and maintain certain financial ratios and tests 
a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives 
a breach of any of our credit agreement or indenture covenants or failure to maintain a required ratio or meet a required test may result in an event of default under those agreements 
this may allow the counterparties to those agreements to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
if this occurs  we may not be able to refinance the indebtedness on favorable terms  or at all  or repay the accelerated indebtedness 
the company s operations require substantial capital  and it may not have adequate capital resources to provide for all of its capital requirements 
the company s businesses are capital intensive and require that it regularly incur capital expenditures in order to maintain its equipment  increase its operating efficiency and comply with environmental laws 
in  the company s total capital expenditures were million  including million for maintenance capital and million for environmental expenditures 
the company s total capital expenditures in were million  including million for maintenance capital and million for environmental expenditures 
if the company s available cash resources and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to fund its operating needs and capital expenditures  the company would have to obtain additional funds from borrowings or other available sources or reduce or delay its capital expenditures 
the company may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms  or at all  particularly as a result of the current contraction and disruption in 
table of contents the credit and equity markets 
in addition  the company s debt service obligations will reduce its available cash flows 
if the company cannot maintain or upgrade its equipment as it requires or allocate funds to ensure environmental compliance  it could be required to curtail or cease some of its manufacturing operations  or it may become unable to manufacture products that compete effectively in one or more of its product lines 
despite current indebtedness levels  the company and its subsidiaries may incur substantially more debt 
this could further exacerbate the risks associated with its substantial leverage 
the company and its subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
although the senior secured credit facilities contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  including secured indebtedness  these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions  and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
for example  as of december   the company had million drawn under its senior secured revolving credit facility as well as million in bank overdraft and million of letters of credit outstanding  resulting in million of availability for future drawings under this facility 
other new borrowings could also be incurred by domtar corporation or its subsidiaries 
if the company incurs additional debt  the risks associated with its substantial leverage would increase 
the company s ability to generate the significant amount of cash needed to pay interest and principal on the domtar corporation notes and service its other debt and financial obligations and its ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing depends on many factors beyond the company s control 
the company has considerable debt service obligations 
the company s ability to make payments on and refinance its debt  including the domtar corporation debt securities and amounts borrowed under its senior secured credit facilities and other financial obligations and to fund its operations will depend on its ability to generate substantial operating cash flow 
the company s cash flow generation will depend on its future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
the company business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to the company under its senior secured credit facilities or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable the company to service its indebtedness  including the domtar corporation notes  and borrowings under its senior secured credit facilities or to fund its other liquidity needs 
if the company cannot service its debt  the company will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing its debt or seeking additional equity capital 
any of these remedies may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  and may impede the implementation of its business strategy 
further  the senior secured credit facilities may restrict the company from adopting any of these alternatives 
because of these and other factors that may be beyond its control  the company may be unable to service its indebtedness 
see risks related to the transaction the company may be affected by significant restrictions following the transaction in order to avoid significant tax related liabilities 
the company is affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
the company manufactures all of its wood products and a significant portion of pulp and paper in canada 
sales of these products by the company s canadian operations will be invoiced in us dollars or in canadian dollars linked to us pricing but most of the costs relating to these products will be incurred in canadian dollars 
as a result  any decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar will reduce the company s profitability 
exchange rate fluctuations are beyond the company s control 
from to  the canadian dollar had appreciated almost relative to the us dollar 
in  the canadian dollar decreased in value by approximately relative to the us dollar 
the level of the canadian dollar can have a material adverse effect on the sales and profitability of the canadian operations 

table of contents the company has liabilities with respect to its pension plans and the actual cost of its pension plan obligations could exceed current provisions 
as of december   the company s defined benefit plans had a surplus of million on certain plans and a deficit of million on others on an ongoing basis 
the company s future funding obligations for the defined benefit pension plans depend upon changes to the level of benefits provided by the plans  the future performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans  the level of interest rates used to determine minimum funding levels  actuarial data and experience  and any changes in government laws and regulations 
as of december   the company s canadian defined benefit pension plans held assets with a fair value of million cdn  million  including million cdn million nominal book value of asset backed commercial paper abcp that have been restructured under the court order governing the montreal accord and million cdn million nominal value of abcp in other conduits outside the montreal accord  for a total nominal value of million cdn million 
at december   the company determined that the fair value of these abcp investments should be reduced to million cdn million 
the million cdn million or valuation adjustment reflected difficult market conditions and the lack of liquidity for these notes 
at december   a million cdn million or valuation adjustment to the nominal book value was taken and reflected in the fair value of the plan assets 
the company does not expect liquidity issues to affect the pension funds since pension fund obligations are primarily long term in nature 
losses in the pension fund investments  if any  would result in future increased contributions by the company or its canadian subsidiaries 
additional contributions to these pension funds would be required to be paid over year or year periods  depending upon the applicable provincial jurisdiction and its requirements for amortization 
losses  if any  would also impact operating results over a longer period of time and immediately increase liabilities and reduce equity 
the company may be required to pay significant lumber export taxes and or countervailing and antidumping duties 
the company may experience reduced revenues and margins on its softwood lumber business as a result of lumber export taxes and or countervailing and antidumping duty applications 
in april  the coalition for fair lumber imports coalition filed two petitions with the us department of commerce department and the international trade commission itc claiming that production of softwood lumber in canada was being subsidized by canada and that imports from canada were being dumped into the us market sold at less than fair value 
the coalition asked that countervailing duty cvd and antidumping ad tariffs be imposed on softwood lumber imported from canada 
in  the canadian and us governments reached a final settlement to this long standing dispute 
the provisions of the settlement included repayment of approximately of the deposits  imposition of export measures in canada  and measures to address long term policy reform 
it is possible that the cvd and ad tariffs or tariffs similar to the cvd and ad tariffs may again be imposed on the company  in the future 
under the settlement agreement  canadian softwood lumber exporters pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price 
under present market conditions  the company s softwood lumber exports are subject to a export charge plus a market restriction on access managed by a quota system 
the company experienced and may continue to experience reduced revenues and margins in the softwood lumber business as a result of the application of the settlement agreement 
the settlement agreement could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial results and financial condition  including  but not limited to  facility closures or impairment of assets 

table of contents the company could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with  violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations 
it could also incur costs as a result of asbestos related personal injury litigation 
the company is subject  in both the united states and canada  to a wide range of general and industry specific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and natural resources  including those governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  harvesting  silvicultural activities  the storage  management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  the cleanup of contaminated sites  landfill operation and closure obligations  forestry operations and endangered species habitat  and health and safety matters 
in particular  the pulp and paper industry in the united states is subject to the united states environmental protection agency s epa cluster rule and was until recently subject to the epa s boiler mact rule the boiler mact rule has been vacated  however  alternative us federal and state regulations are being discussed that further regulate effluent and air emissions 
these laws and regulations require the company to obtain authorizations from and comply with the requirements of the appropriate governmental authorities  which have considerable discretion over the terms and timing of permits 
the company has incurred  and expects that it will continue to incur  significant capital  operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations as a result of remedial obligations 
the company incurred approximately million of operating expenses and million of capital expenditures in connection with environmental compliance and remediation for as of december   the company had a provision of million for environmental expenditures  including certain asset retirement obligations such as for land fill capping and asbestos removal million as of december  
in addition  in  the company closed its pulp and paper mill in prince albert  saskatchewan and the big river sawmill in saskatchewan 
the company has not determined whether either of these facilities will be reopened  sold or permanently closed 
in the event the facilities are permanently closed  the province of saskatchewan may require active decommissioning and reclamation at one or both facilities  which would likely include investigation and remedial action for areas of significant environmental impacts 
the province of saskatchewan has required certain facilities located in the province to submit preliminary decommissioning and reclamation plans and to include in such plans estimates of costs associated with decommissioning and reclamation activities 
weyerhaeuser submitted such a plan for its pulp and paper facility in prince albert  saskatchewan 
in its preliminary decommissioning and reclamation plan  weyerhaeuser included a preliminary  generalized estimate of costs ranging from cdn to cdn million to million 
weyerhaeuser advised the province of saskatchewan that it was not providing a detailed delineation of costs at this time because such costs will depend on site specific factors  the professional judgments of environmental specialists and experts  further detailed environmental site assessments  and most fundamentally  a decision about the future use or closure of the site 
the estimate referred to above does not take into account the equipment resale value or scrap material value  nor does it include the cost of completing a phase ii environmental site assessment which could involve sampling and analysis of building materials and environmental media  or the cost of any remediation required based on such assessment 
the company has not undertaken an in depth review of weyerhaeuser s estimate and the net decommissioning and reclamation costs could exceed weyerhaeuser s estimate 
the company also could incur substantial costs  such as civil or criminal fines  sanctions and enforcement actions including orders limiting its operations or requiring corrective measures  installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions  cleanup and closure costs  and third party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws and regulations 
the company s ongoing efforts to identify potential environmental concerns that may be associated with its past and present properties will lead to future environmental investigations 
those efforts will likely result in the determination of additional environmental costs and liabilities which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
as the owner and operator of real estate  the company may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup  closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances  including asbestos  
table of contents on or from its properties or operations 
the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict  and  in some cases  the company s liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether it knew of  or caused  the release of hazardous substances and may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself 
the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at the company s or third party sites may result in significant additional costs 
any material liability the company incurs could adversely impact its financial condition or preclude it from making capital expenditures that would otherwise benefit its business 
in addition  the company may be subject to asbestos related personal injury litigation arising out of exposure to asbestos on or from its properties or operations  and may incur substantial costs as a result of any defense  settlement  or adverse judgment in such litigation 
the company may not have access to insurance proceeds to cover costs associated with asbestos related personal injury litigation 
enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations  or interpretation thereof  might require significant expenditures 
the company may be unable to generate funds or other sources of liquidity and capital to fund environmental liabilities or expenditures 
the company depends on third parties for transportation services 
the company relies primarily on third parties for transportation of the products it manufactures and or distributes  as well as delivery of its raw materials 
in particular  a significant portion of the goods it manufactures and raw materials it uses are transported by railroad or trucks  which are highly regulated 
if any of its third party transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods the company manufactures or distributes in a timely manner  the company may be unable to sell those products at full value  or at all 
similarly  if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to the company in a timely manner  it may be unable to manufacture its products in response to customer demand 
in addition  if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with the company  it may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost 
any failure of a third party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm the company s reputation  negatively impact its customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results 
the company s intellectual property rights are valuable  and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of its products and its brands 
the company relies on patent  trademark  and other intellectual property laws of the united states and other countries to protect its intellectual property rights 
however  the company may be unable to prevent third parties from using its respective intellectual property without its authorization  which may reduce any competitive advantage it has developed 
if the company had to litigate to protect these rights  any proceedings could be costly  and it may not prevail 
the company cannot guarantee that any united states or foreign patents  issued or pending  will provide it with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties 
additionally  the company has obtained and applied for united states and foreign trademark registrations  and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks  as appropriate 
the company cannot guarantee that any of its pending patent or trademark applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities and  even if the applications are approved  third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations 
the failure to secure any pending patent or trademark applications may limit the company s ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these applications were intended to cover 

table of contents risks related to the transaction the historical financial information of the predecessor may not be representative of its results if the weyerhaeuser fine paper business had been operated independently of weyerhaeuser and  as a result  may not be a reliable indicator of its future results 
prior to the closing date  the predecessor was a fully integrated business unit of weyerhaeuser 
consequently  the financial information of the predecessor included in this document has been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of weyerhaeuser and reflects assumptions and allocations made by weyerhaeuser 
the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the predecessor presented may be different from those that would have resulted had the predecessor been operated independently 
for example  in preparing the predecessor financial statements  weyerhaeuser has made an allocation of costs and expenses that are attributable to the predecessor 
however  these costs and expenses reflect the costs and expenses attributable to the predecessor operated as part of a larger organization and do not reflect costs and expenses that would be incurred by this business had it been operated independently 
as a result  the historical financial information of the predecessor may not be a reliable indicator of future results 
aboriginal interests may delay or result in challenges to the transfer of certain forest licenses and forest management agreements 
under applicable forestry legislation in saskatchewan  weyerhaeuser must obtain consent from the government of saskatchewan in order to complete the transfer of certain timber rights in saskatchewan to the company 
pursuant to the agreements governing the transaction  the transfer of these timber rights were delayed until the appropriate approvals are received 
recent supreme court of canada decisions have confirmed that the federal and provincial governments in canada have a duty to consult with  and in certain circumstances  seek to accommodate aboriginal groups whenever there is a reasonable prospect that a government s decision may adversely affect an aboriginal group s interests in relevant land and resources that are the subject of the decision 
the company believes that the government of saskatchewan has consulted with relevant aboriginal groups in connection with these consent approvals 
this consultation process could result in delays  constrain access to the timber or give rise to additional costs 
in addition  if the government of saskatchewan does not adequately discharge its obligation this could result in litigation 
it is not possible at present to predict the risks associated with such litigation 
if the distribution by weyerhaeuser of its shares of company common stock to the holders of weyerhaeuser common shares and weyerhaeuser exchangeable shares pursuant to an exchange offer distribution did not constitute a tax free transaction  either as a result of actions taken in connection with the distribution or as a result of subsequent acquisitions of shares of company common stock  then the company may be responsible for payment of substantial us federal income taxes under its tax sharing agreement with weyerhaeuser 
weyerhaeuser received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service on february  to the effect that  based on the facts  assumptions  representations and undertakings set forth in the ruling  the contribution and distribution qualified as tax free to weyerhaeuser and the holders of weyerhaeuser common shares for us federal income tax purposes under sections and and related provisions of the code 
the distribution would become taxable to weyerhaeuser pursuant to section e of the code if or more by vote or value of equity securities of the company were acquired  directly or indirectly  by persons other than weyerhaeuser shareholders as part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the distribution 
because weyerhaeuser shareholders owned more than of company common stock following the arrangement  the arrangement  by itself  would not have caused the distribution to be taxable to weyerhaeuser under section e of the code 
however  if the irs were to determine that other acquisitions of company equity securities  either before or after the distribution and the arrangement  were part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the distribution such determination could result in the recognition of a 
table of contents gain by weyerhaeuser under section e of the code 
in such case  the gain recognized by weyerhaeuser likely would include the entire fair market value of the company common stock distributed to weyerhaeuser s shareholders  and thus would be substantial 
under the tax sharing agreement among weyerhaeuser  the company  and domtar inc  the company generally would be required to indemnify weyerhaeuser against tax related losses to weyerhaeuser and or its shareholders that arise as a result of certain actions taken or omissions to act by the company  its subsidiaries or certain affiliates of the company disqualifying actions after the transaction

the company may be affected by significant restrictions following the transaction in order to avoid significant tax related liabilities 
even if the distribution qualifies as a tax free reorganization  it may not qualify as a transaction that is tax free to weyerhaeuser if or more by vote or value of the equity securities of the company are acquired by persons other than weyerhaeuser shareholders as part of a plan that includes the distribution pursuant to section e of the code 
the tax sharing agreement requires that the company  its subsidiaries and certain affiliates of the company  for a two year period following the closing date  avoid taking certain actions that might cause the distribution to be treated as part of a plan pursuant to which or more of the company s equity securities are acquired 
certain of these disqualifying actions subject to restrictions include the redemption  recapitalization  repurchase or acquisition by the company of its capital stock  the issuance by the company of capital stock or convertible debt  the liquidation of the company  the discontinuance of the operations of the predecessor  the sale or disposition other than in the ordinary course of business of all or a substantial part of the predecessor  or the other actions  omissions to act or transactions that could jeopardize the tax free status of the distribution 
to the extent that the tax free status of the distribution is lost because of a disqualifying action after the date of consummation of the transaction  the company generally will be required to indemnify  defend and hold harmless weyerhaeuser from and against any and all resulting tax related losses incurred by weyerhaeuser and or weyerhaeuser shareholders  without regard to whether weyerhaeuser gave the company prior written consent to the specific action taken by the company 
because of these restrictions  the company may be limited in its ability to pursue strategic transactions or equity or convertible debt financing or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of its business
