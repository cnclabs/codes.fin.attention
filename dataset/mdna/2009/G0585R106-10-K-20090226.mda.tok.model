an insurance financial strength rating is an opinion with respect to an insurer s ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms 
the opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract 
insurance financial strength ratings do not refer to an insurer s ability to meet non insurance obligations and are not a recommendation to purchase or discontinue any policy or contract issued by an insurer or to buy  hold  or sell any security issued by an insurer  including our common shares 
on july   moody s placed under review for possible downgrade the aaa insurance financial strength ratings of assured guaranty corp 
agc and its wholly owned subsidiary  assured guaranty uk ltd  as well as the aa insurance financial strength ratings of assured guaranty re ltd 
ag re and its affiliated insurance operating companies 
moody s has placed under review for possible downgrade the aa senior unsecured rating of parent company  assured guaranty us holdings inc and the aa issuer rating of the ultimate holding company  assured guaranty ltd 
moody s revised assessment of stress case loss estimates on our residential mortgage backed securities portfolio did not change meaningfully from their prior estimates 
on november   moody s downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings of agc and its wholly owned subsidiary  assured guaranty uk ltd  to aa from aaa and also downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings of ag re and its affiliated insurance operating companies to aa from aa in the same rating action  moody s downgraded the senior unsecured rating of assured 
table of contents guaranty us holdings inc and the issuer rating of the ultimate holding company  assured guaranty ltd 
to a from aa if the ratings of any of our insurance subsidiaries were reduced below current levels  we expect it would have an adverse effect on our subsidiary s competitive position and its prospects for future business opportunities 
a downgrade may also reduce the value of the reinsurance we offer  which may no longer be of sufficient economic value for our customers to continue to cede to our subsidiaries at economically viable rates 
with respect to a significant portion of our in force financial guaranty reinsurance business  in the event that ag re were downgraded from aa to a  subject to the terms of each reinsurance agreement  the ceding company may have the right to recapture business ceded to ag re and assets representing substantially all of the statutory unearned premium and loss reserves if any associated with that business 
as of december   the statutory unearned premium  which represents deferred revenue to the company  subject to recapture is approximately million 
if this entire amount was recaptured  it would result in a corresponding one time reduction to net income of approximately million 
with respect to one of ag re s ceding companies  the right to recapture business can only be exercised if ag re were downgraded to the a category by more than one rating agency  or below a a by any one rating agency 
as of december   the statutory unearned premium subject to recapture by this ceding company is approximately million 
if this entire amount were recaptured  it would result in a corresponding one time reduction to net income of approximately million 
alternatively  the ceding company can increase the commissions it charges ag re for cessions 
any such increase may be retroactive to the date of the cession 
as of december   the potential increase in ceding commissions would result in a one rime reduction to net income of approximately million 
the effect on net income under these scenarios is exclusive of any capital gains or losses that may be realized 
if a credit derivative is terminated  the company could be required to make a mark to market payment as determined under the isda documentation 
for example  if agc s rating were downgraded to a  under market conditions at december   if the counterparties exercised their right to terminate their credit derivatives  agc would have been required to make payments that the company estimates to be approximately million 
further  if agc s rating was downgraded to a level below bbb it would have been required to make additional payments that the company estimates to be approximately million at december  the company s mark to market methodology is  however  not the basis on which any such payment amount would be determined 
the process for determining the amount of such payment is set forth in the credit derivative documentation and generally follows market practice for derivative contracts 
the actual amounts could be materially larger than the company s estimate 
under a limited number of credit derivative contracts  the company is required to post eligible securities as collateral  generally cash or us government or agency securities 
the need to post collateral under these transactions is generally based on mark to market valuation in excess of contractual thresholds 
the particular thresholds decline if the company s ratings decline 
as of december  the company had pre ipo transactions with approximately billion of par subject to collateral posting due to changes in market value 
of this amount  as of december   the company posted collateral totaling approximately million including million for agc based on the unrealized mark to market loss position for transactions with two of its counterparties 
any amounts required to be posted as collateral in the future will depend on changes in the market values of these transactions 
additionally  in the event agc were downgraded below a  contractual thresholds would be eliminated and the amount of par that could be subject to collateral posting requirements would be billion 
based on market values as of december   such a downgrade would have resulted in agc posting an additional million of collateral 
currently no additional collateral posting is required or anticipated for any other transactions 

table of contents the company s financial strength ratings assigned by s p and fitch were affirmed on june  and december   respectively 
management is uncertain what  if any  impact moody s ratings actions will have on the company s financial strength ratings from s p and fitch 
on april   investment funds managed by wl ross co 
llc wl ross purchased  shares of the company s common equity at a price of per share  resulting in proceeds to the company of million 
the company contributed million of these proceeds to its subsidiary  assured guaranty re ltd 
in addition  the company contributed million of these proceeds to its subsidiary  assured guaranty us holdings inc  which in turn contributed the same amount to its subsidiary  agc 
the commitment to purchase these shares was previously announced on february  in addition  wilbur l 
ross  jr  president and chief executive officer of wl ross  has been appointed to the board of directors of the company to serve a term expiring at the company s annual general meeting of shareholders 
mr 
ross s appointment became effective immediately following the company s annual general meeting of shareholders  which was held on may  wl ross has a remaining commitment through april  to purchase up to million of the company s common equity  at the company s option  subject to the terms and conditions of the investment agreement with the company dated february  in accordance with the investment agreement  the company may exercise this option in one or more drawdowns  subject to a minimum drawdown of million  provided that the purchase price per common share for the subsequent shares is not greater than  or less than  the price per common share for the initial shares 
the purchase price per common share for such shares will be equal to of the volume weighted average price of a common share on the nyse for the nyse trading days prior to the applicable drawdown notice 
as of december   and as of the date of this filing  the purchase price per common share is outside of this range and therefore the company may not  at this time  exercise its option for wl ross to purchase additional shares 
on september   the company agreed to waive the standstill provisions of the investment agreement to permit investment funds managed by wl ross the wlr funds to purchase up to  additional common shares of the company in open market transactions from time to time 
the timing and amount of any such purchases are in the sole discretion of wl ross and they are not obligated to purchase any such shares 
the additional shares purchased by the wlr funds  if any  will be purchased from current shareholders and therefore will not result in an increase in shareholders equity at the company or its subsidiaries 
if all  additional shares were purchased  the wlr funds would beneficially own  shares or approximately of the company s outstanding common shares based on shares outstanding as of december  as of the date of this filing the company has not been notified that wlr funds purchased any additional shares of the company 
on december   the company completed the sale of  of its common shares at a price of per share 
the net proceeds of the sale totaled approximately million 
the company has contributed the net proceeds of the offering to its reinsurance subsidiary  ag re

ambac for approximately billion of net par outstanding  as well as to support the growth of agc  the company s principal direct financial guaranty subsidiary  by providing reinsurance 
ag re is agc s principal financial guaranty reinsurer 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of other companies  lines of business and portfolios of risks and hold discussions with potential third parties regarding such transactions 
as a general rule  we publicly announce such transactions only after a definitive agreement has been reached 
on november   assured guaranty ltd 
announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement the purchase agreement with dexia holdings  inc dexia to purchase financial security assurance holdings ltd 
fsah and  indirectly  all of its subsidiaries  including the financial guaranty insurance company  financial security assurance  inc the definitive agreement provides that the company will be indemnified against exposure to fsah s financial products segment

the remaining shares of fsah are currently held by current or former directors of fsah 
assured expects that it will acquire the remaining shares of fsah common stock concurrent with the closing of the acquisition of shares of fsah common stock from dexia or shortly thereafter at the same price paid to dexia 
we expect to close this transaction is expected to occur in either the first or second quarter of the purchase price is million based upon the closing price of the company s common shares on the nyse on november  of  consisting of million in cash and up to  of the company s common shares 
if  prior to the closing date under the stock purchase agreement  the company issues new common shares other than pursuant to an employee benefit plan or other securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for or otherwise linked to the company s common shares at a purchase price per share of less than  the company has agreed to issue to dexia on the closing date an additional number of the company s common shares with an aggregate value as of the closing date measured based on the average of the volume weighted average price per share for each day in the nyse trading day period ending three business days prior to the closing date representing the amount of dilution as a result of such issuance 
the amount of dilution is defined to mean x the number of the company s common shares issued or that upon conversion or exchange would be issuable as a result of the dilutive issuance  multiplied by y the positive difference if any between and the purchase or reference  implied  conversion  exchange or comparable price per share received by the company in the dilutive issuance  multiplied by z the percentage of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company represented by the company common shares to be received by dexia under the stock purchase agreement without taking into account any additional assured guaranty ltd 
s common shares issued or issuable as a result of the anti dilution provision 
under the purchase agreement  the company may elect to pay per share in cash in lieu of up to  of the company s common shares that it would otherwise deliver as part of the purchase price 
the company expects to finance the cash portion of the acquisition with the proceeds of a public equity offering 
the company has received a backstop commitment the wlr backstop commitment from the wlr funds  a related party  to fund the cash portion of the purchase price with the purchase of newly issued common shares 
the company entered into the wlr backstop commitment on november  with the wlr funds 
the wlr backstop commitment amended the investment agreement between the company and the wlr funds and provided to the company the option to cause the wlr funds to purchase from assured guaranty ltd 
or assured guaranty us holdings inc a number of the company s common shares equal to the quotient of i the aggregate dollar amount not to exceed million specified by the company divided by ii the volume weighted average price of the company s common share on the nyse for the nyse trading days ending with the last nyse trading day immediately preceding the date of the closing under the stock purchase agreement  with a floor of and a cap of the wlr funds have no obligation to purchase these common shares pursuant to the wlr backstop commitment until the closing under the stock purchase agreement occurs 
the company may use the proceeds from the sale of the company s common shares pursuant to the wlr backstop commitment solely to pay a portion of the purchase price under the stock purchase agreement 
the wlr funds obligations under the wlr backstop commitment have been secured by letters of credit issued for the benefit of the company by bank of america  na and rbs citizens bank  na  each in the amount of million 
the company has paid the wlr funds a nonrefundable commitment fee of  in connection with the option granted by the wlr backstop commitment and has agreed to pay the 
table of contents wlr funds expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby 
the company has agreed to reimburse the wlr funds for the million cost of obtaining the letters of credit referred to above 
in january  agc finalized an agreement with cifg assurance north america  inc cifg to assume a diversified portfolio of financial guaranty contracts totaling approximately billion of net par outstanding 
agc received million  which included million of upfront premiums net of ceding commissions and approximately million of future installments related to this transaction 
the financial guaranty industry  along with many other financial institutions  continues to be threatened by deterioration of the credit performance of securities collateralized by us residential mortgages 
there is significant uncertainty surrounding general economic factors  including interest rates and housing prices  which may adversely affect our loss experience on these securities 
the company continues to monitor these exposures and update our loss estimates as new information is received 
additionally  scrutiny from state and federal regulatory agencies could result in changes that limit our business 
our financial results include four principal business segments financial guaranty direct  financial guaranty reinsurance  mortgage guaranty and other 
the other segment represents lines of business that we exited or sold as part of our initial public offering ipo 
we derive our revenues principally from premiums from our insurance and reinsurance businesses  unrealized gains and losses and realized gains and other settlements on credit derivatives  net investment income  and net realized gains and losses from our investment portfolio 
our premiums and realized gains and other settlement on credit derivatives are a function of the amount and type of contracts we write as well as prevailing market prices 
we receive payments on an upfront basis when the policy is issued or the contract is executed and or on an installment basis over the life of the applicable transaction 
investment income is a function of invested assets and the yield that we earn on those assets 
the investment yield is a function of market interest rates at the time of investment as well as the type  credit quality and maturity of our invested assets 
in addition  we could realize capital losses on securities in our investment portfolio from other than temporary declines in market value as a result of changing market conditions  including changes in market interest rates  and changes in the credit quality of our invested assets 
realized gains and other settlements on credit derivatives include credit derivative premiums received and receivable for credit protection the company has sold under its credit default swaps cds  any contractual claim losses paid and payable related to insured credit events under these contracts  realized gains or losses related to their early termination and ceding commissions expense income 
the company generally holds credit derivative contracts to maturity 
however  in certain circumstances such as for risk management purposes or as a result of a decision to exit a line of business  the company may decide to terminate a derivative contract prior to maturity 
unrealized gains losses on credit derivatives represent the adjustments for changes in fair value that are recorded in each reporting period under fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
changes in unrealized gains and losses on credit derivatives are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income in unrealized gains losses on credit derivatives 
cumulative unrealized gains losses  determined on a contract by contract basis  are reflected as either net assets or net liabilities in the company s balance sheets 
unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of credit derivatives occur because of changes in interest rates  credit spreads  the credit ratings of the referenced entities  the company s credit rating and other market factors 
the unrealized gains losses on credit derivatives will reduce to zero as the exposure approaches its maturity date  unless there is a payment default on the exposure 

table of contents changes in the fair value of the company s credit derivatives do not reflect actual claims or credit losses  and have no impact on the company s claims paying resources  rating agency capital or regulatory capital positions 
in and the company also recorded a fair value gain of million and million  pre tax  respectively  related to assured guaranty corp 
s committed capital securities 
our expenses consist primarily of losses and loss adjustment expenses lae  profit commission expense  acquisition costs  operating expenses  interest expense  put option premium expense associated with our committed capital securities the ccs securities and income taxes 
losses and lae are a function of the amount and types of business we write 
losses and lae are based upon estimates of the ultimate aggregate losses inherent in the portfolio 
the risks we take have a low expected frequency of loss and are investment grade at the time we accept the risk 
profit commission expense represents payments made to ceding companies generally based on the profitability of the business reinsured by us 
acquisition costs are related to the production of new business 
certain acquisition costs that vary with and are directly attributable to the production of new business are deferred and recognized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and other employee related costs  including share based compensation  various outside service providers  rent and related costs and other expenses related to maintaining a holding company structure 
these costs do not vary with the amount of premiums written 
interest expense is a function of outstanding debt and the contractual interest rate related to that debt 
put option premium expense  which is included in other expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  is a function of the outstanding amount of the ccs securities and the applicable distribution rate 
income taxes are a function of our profitability and the applicable tax rate in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements include amounts that  either by their nature or due to requirements of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  are determined using estimates and assumptions 
the actual amounts realized could ultimately be materially different from the amounts currently provided for in our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the items requiring the most inherently subjective and complex estimates to be reserves for losses and lae  fair value of credit derivatives  fair value of committed capital securities  valuation of investments  other than temporary impairments of investments  premium revenue recognition  deferred acquisition costs  deferred income taxes and accounting for share based compensation 
an understanding of our accounting policies for these items is of critical importance to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion provides more information regarding the estimates and assumptions used for these items and should be read in conjunction with the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for non derivative transactions in our financial guaranty direct  financial guaranty assumed reinsurance and mortgage guaranty business include case reserves and portfolio reserves 
see the fair value of credit derivatives of the critical accounting estimates section for more information on our derivative transactions 
case reserves are established when there is significant credit deterioration on specific insured obligations and the obligations are in default or default is probable  not necessarily upon non payment of principal or interest by an insured 
case reserves represent the present value of expected future loss payments and lae  net of estimated recoveries  but before considering ceded reinsurance 
this reserving method is different from case reserves established by traditional property and casualty insurance companies  which establish case reserves upon notification of a claim and establish incurred but not reported ibnr reserves for the 
table of contents difference between actuarially estimated ultimate losses and recorded case reserves 
financial guaranty insurance and assumed reinsurance case reserves and related salvage and subrogation  if any  are discounted at the taxable equivalent yield on our investment portfolio  which is approximately  in all periods presented 
when the company becomes entitled to the underlying collateral of an insured credit under salvage and subrogation rights as a result of a claim payment  it records salvage and subrogation as an asset  based on the expected level of recovery 
such amounts have been recorded as a salvage recoverable asset in the company s balance sheets 
we record portfolio reserves in our financial guaranty direct  financial guaranty assumed reinsurance and mortgage guaranty business 
portfolio reserves are established with respect to the portion of our business for which case reserves have not been established 
portfolio reserves are not established based on a specific event  rather they are calculated by aggregating the portfolio reserve calculated for each individual transaction 
individual transaction reserves are calculated on a quarterly basis by multiplying the par in force by the product of the ultimate loss and earning factors without regard to discounting 
the ultimate loss factor is defined as the frequency of loss multiplied by the severity of loss  where the frequency is defined as the probability of default for each individual issue 
the earning factor is inception to date earned premium divided by the estimated ultimate written premium for each transaction 
the probability of default is estimated from rating agency data and is based on the transaction s credit rating  industry sector and time until maturity 
the severity is defined as the complement of recovery salvage rates gathered by the rating agencies of defaulting issues and is based on the industry sector 
portfolio reserves are recorded gross of reinsurance 
we have not ceded any amounts under these reinsurance contracts  as our recorded portfolio reserves have not exceeded our contractual retentions  required by said contracts 
the company records an incurred loss that is reflected in the statement of operations upon the establishment of portfolio reserves 
when we initially record a case reserve  we reclassify the corresponding portfolio reserve already recorded for that credit within the balance sheet 
the difference between the initially recorded case reserve and the reclassified portfolio reserve is recorded as a charge in our statement of operations 
any subsequent change in portfolio reserves or the initial case reserves are recorded quarterly as a charge or credit in our statement of operations in the period such estimates change 
due to the inherent uncertainties of estimating loss and lae reserves  actual experience may differ from the estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements  and the differences may be material 
the weighted average default frequencies and severities as of december  and december  are as follows average default frequency average default severity december  december  the company incorporates default frequency and severity by asset class into its portfolio loss reserve models 
average default frequency and severity are based on information published by rating agencies 
the increase in average default frequency shown in is reflective of downgrades within the company s direct insured portfolio  including heloc exposures 
rating agencies update default frequency and severity information on a periodic basis  as warranted by changes in observable data 
the chart below demonstrates the portfolio reserve s sensitivity to frequency and severity assumptions 
the change in these estimates represent management s estimate of reasonably possible material changes and are based upon our analysis of historical experience 
portfolio reserves were recalculated with changes made to the default and severity assumptions 
in all scenarios  the starting point used to test the portfolio reserve s sensitivity to the changes in the frequency and severity 
table of contents assumptions was the weighted average frequency and severity by rating and asset class of our insured portfolio 
overall the weighted average default frequency was and the weighted average severity was at december  for example  in the first scenario where the frequency was increased by  each transaction s contribution to the portfolio reserve was recalculated by adding ie multiplied by to the individual transaction s default frequency 
in thousands of us dollars portfolio reserve reserve increase percentage change portfolio reserve as of december  frequency increase frequency increase severity increase severity increase frequency and severity increase includes portfolio reserve on credit derivatives of million  which balance is included in credit derivative liability in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to analyzing the sensitivity of our portfolio reserves to possible changes in frequency and severity  we have also considered the effect of changes in assumptions on our financial guaranty and mortgage guaranty case reserves 
at december  case reserves were million 
case reserves may change from our original estimate due to changes in assumptions including  but not limited to  severity factors  credit deterioration of underlying obligations and salvage estimates 
we discuss below the asset classes and credit for which we have recorded expected case losses and which are the most significant credits in our insured portfolio 
home equity line of credit heloc transactions specifically with respect to reserves related to our us home equity line of credit heloc and other us residential mortgage exposures  there exists significant uncertainty as to the ultimate performance of these transactions 
as of december   the company had net par outstanding of billion related to heloc securitizations  of which billion are transactions with countrywide and billion were written in the company s financial guaranty direct segment direct countrywide transactions or countrywide j and countrywide d 
the performance of our heloc exposures deteriorated during and and transactions  particularly those originated in the period from through  continue to perform below our original underwriting expectations 
in accordance with our standard practice  during the year ended december   we evaluated the most currently available information  including trends in delinquencies and charge offs on the underlying loans  draw rates on the lines of credit  and the servicer s ability to fulfill its contractual obligations including its obligation to fund additional draws 
in recent periods  constant default rate cdr  constant payment rate cpr  draw rates and delinquency percentages have fluctuated within ranges that we believe make it appropriate to use rolling averages to project future performance 
accordingly  the company is using modeling assumptions that are based upon or which approximate recent actual historical performance to project future performance and potential losses 
during  the company extended the time frame during which it expects the cdr to remain elevated 
the company also revised its assumptions with respect to the overall shape of the default and loss curves 
among other things  these changes assume that a higher proportion of projected defaults will occur over the near term 
this revision was based upon management s judgment that a variety of factors including the deterioration of us economic conditions could lead to a longer period in which default rates remain high 
the company continues to model sensitivities around the results booked using a variety of cdr rates and stress periods as well as other modeling approaches including roll rates and hybrid roll rate cdr methods 
as a result of this modeling and analysis  the company incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses of million for 
table of contents its direct countrywide transactions during the company s cumulative incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses on the direct countrywide transactions as of december  were million million after tax 
during  the company paid losses and loss adjustment expenses for its direct countrywide transactions of million  of which we expect to recover million from the receipt of excess spread from future cash flows as well as funding of future draws 
this amount of million is included in salvage recoverable on the balance sheet 
there were no incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses or salvage recoverable amounts on these transactions in credit support for heloc transactions comes primarily from two sources 
in the first instance  excess spread is used to build a certain amount of credit enhancement and absorb losses 
over the past months  excess spread the difference between the interest collections on the collateral and the interest paid on the insured notes has averaged approximately basis points per annum 
additionally  for the transactions serviced by countrywide  the servicer is required to fund additional draws on the heloc loans following the occurrence of a rapid amortization event 
among other things  such an event is triggered when claim payments by us exceed a certain threshold 
prior to the occurrence of a rapid amortization event  during the transactions revolving period  new draws on the heloc loans are funded first from principal collections 
as such  during the revolving period no additional credit enhancement is created by the additional draws  and the speed at which our exposure amortizes is reduced to the extent of such additional draws  since principal collections are used to fund those draws rather than pay down the insured notes 
subsequent to the occurrence of a rapid amortization event  new draws are funded by countrywide and all principal collections are used to pay down the insured notes 
any draws funded by countrywide are subordinate to us in the cash flow waterfall and hence represent additional credit enhancement available to absorb losses before we have to make a claim payment 
additionally  since all principal collections are used to pay down the insured notes  rather than fund additional draws  our exposure begins to amortize more quickly 
a rapid amortization event occurred for countrywide d in april and for countrywide j in may we have modeled our heloc exposures under a number of different scenarios  taking into account the multiple variables and structural features that materially affect transaction performance and potential losses to us 
the key variables include the speed or rate at which borrowers make payments on their loans  as measured by the cpr  the default rate  as measured by the cdr  excess spread  and the amount of loans that are already delinquent more than days 
we also take into account the pool factor the percentage of the original principal balance that remains outstanding  and the timing of the remaining cash flows 
additionally  it should be noted that our contractual rights allow us to retroactively claim that loans included in the insured pool were inappropriately included in the pool by the seller  and to put these loans back to the seller such that we would not be responsible for losses related to these loans 
such actions would benefit us by reducing potential losses 
we have included in our loss model an estimated benefit for loans we expect countrywide will repurchase 
the cpr is the annualized rate at which the portfolio amortizes  so that a cpr implies that of the collateral will be retired over a one year period 
the cdr is the annualized default rate  so that a cdr implies that of the remaining collateral will default each year 

table of contents the ultimate performance of the company s heloc transactions will depend on many factors  such as the level and timing of loan defaults  interest proceeds generated by the securitized loans  repayment speeds and changes in home prices  as well as the levels of credit support built into each transaction 
other factors also may have a material impact upon the ultimate performance of each transaction  including the ability of the seller and servicer to fulfill all of their contractual obligations including its obligation to fund future draws on lines of credit  as well as the amount of benefit received from repurchases of ineligible loans by countrywide 
the variables affecting transaction performance are interrelated  difficult to predict and subject to considerable volatility 
if actual results differ materially from any of our assumptions  the losses incurred could be materially different from our estimate 
we continue to update our evaluation of these exposures as new information becomes available 
the key assumptions used in our case loss reserves on the direct countrywide transactions is presented in the following table key variables constant payment rate cpr month average  currently constant default rate cdr month average cdr of approximately during months  declining to at the end of month from months onward  a cdr is assumed 
draw rate month average  currently excess spread bps per annum repurchases of ineligible loans by countrywide million  or approximately of original pool balance of billion loss severity subprime  alt a and closed end second rmbs transactions another type of rmbs transaction is generally referred to as subprime rmbs 
the collateral supporting such transactions is comprised of first lien residential mortgage loans made to subprime borrowers 
a subprime borrower is one considered to be a higher risk credit based on credit scores or other risk characteristics 
as of december   we had net par outstanding of billion related to subprime rmbs securitizations  of which million is classified by us as below investment grade risk 
of the total us subprime rmbs exposure of billion  billion is from transactions issued in the period from through and written in our direct financial guaranty segment 
as of december   we had portfolio reserves of million and case reserves of million related to our billion us subprime rmbs exposure  of which million were portfolio reserves related to our billion exposure in the direct financial guaranty segment for transactions issued from through the problems affecting the subprime mortgage market have been widely reported  with rising delinquencies  defaults and foreclosures negatively impacting the performance of subprime rmbs transactions 
those concerns relate primarily to subprime rmbs issued in the period from through the billion exposure that we have to such transactions in our direct financial guaranty segment benefits from various structural protections  including credit enhancement that on average currently equals approximately of the remaining principal balance of the transactions 

table of contents we also have exposure of million to closed end second ces rmbs transactions  of which million is in the direct segment 
as with other types of rmbs  we have seen significant deterioration in the performance of our ces transactions 
on two transactions  which had exposure of million  during we have seen a significant increase in delinquencies and collateral losses  which resulted in erosion of the company s credit enhancement and the payment of claims totaling million 
based on the company s analysis of these transaction and their projected collateral losses  the company had case reserves of million as of december  in its direct segment 
additionally  as of december   the company had portfolio reserves of million in its financial guaranty direct segment and no case or portfolio reserves in its financial guaranty reinsurance segment related to its us closed end second rmbs exposure 
another type of rmbs transaction is generally referred to as alt a rmbs 
the collateral supporting such transactions is comprised of first lien residential mortgage loans made to prime quality borrowers that lack certain ancillary characteristics that would make them prime 
included in this category is alt a option arms  which include transactions where or more of the collateral is comprised of mortgage loans that have the potential to negatively amortize 
as of december   the company had net par outstanding of billion related to alt a rmbs securitizations 
of that amount  billion is from transactions issued in the period from through and written in the company s financial guaranty direct segment 
as of december   the company had portfolio reserves of million and case reserves of million related to its billion alt a rmbs exposure  in the financial guaranty direct and reinsurance segments  respectively 
the ultimate performance of the company s rmbs transactions remains highly uncertain and may be subject to considerable volatility due to the influence of many factors  including the level and timing of loan defaults  changes in housing prices and other variables 
the company will continue to monitor the performance of its rmbs exposures and will adjust the risk ratings of those transactions based on actual performance and management s estimates of future performance 
life insurance securitizations the company has exposure on two life insurance reserve securitization transactions based on two discrete blocks of individual life insurance business reinsured by scottish re us inc scottish re 
the two transactions relate to ballantyne re plc ballantyne gross exposure of million and orkney re ii  plc orkney ii gross exposure of million 
under both transactions  monies raised through the issuance of the insured notes support present and future us statutory life insurance reserve requirements 
the monies were invested at inception of each transaction in accounts managed by a large  well known investment manager 
however  those investment accounts have incurred substantial mark to market losses since mid year  principally as a result of their exposure to subprime and alt a rmbs transactions 
largely as a result of these mark to market losses both we and the rating agencies have downgraded our exposure to both ballantyne and orkney ii to below investment grade 
as regards the ballantyne transaction  the company is working with the directing guarantor  who has insured exposure of million  to remediate the risk 
on the orkney re ii transaction  the company  as directing financial guarantor  is taking remedial action 
some credit losses have been realized on the securities in the ballantyne and orkney re ii portfolios and significant additional credit losses are expected to occur 
performance of the underlying blocks of life insurance business thus far generally has been in accordance with expectations 
the combination of cash flows from the investment accounts and the treaty settlements currently is sufficient to cover interest payments due on the notes that we insure 
adverse treaty performance and or a rise in credit losses on the invested assets are expected to lead to interest shortfalls 
additionally  the transactions also contain features linked to the market values of the invested assets  reserve funding requirements on the underlying blocks of life insurance business  and minimum capital 
table of contents requirements for the transactions themselves that may trigger a shut off of interest payments to the insured notes and thereby result in claim payments by the company 
another key risk is that the occurrence of certain events may result in a situation where either ballantyne and or orkney re ii are required to sell assets and potentially realize substantial investment losses and for assured guaranty ltd 
to incur corresponding insured losses ahead of the scheduled final maturity date 
for example  cedants to scottish re may have the right to recapture blocks of life insurance business which scottish re has ceded to orkney re ii 
such recaptures could require orkney re ii to sell assets and realize investment losses 
in the ballantyne transaction  further declines in the market value of the invested assets and or an increase in the reserve funding requirements could lead to a similar mandatory realization of investment losses and for assured guaranty ltd 
to incur corresponding insured losses ahead of the scheduled final maturity date 
in order for the company to incur an ultimate net loss on these transactions  adverse experience on the underlying block of life insurance policies and or credit losses in the investment portfolio would need to exceed the level of credit enhancement built into the transaction structures 
based on its analysis of the information currently available  including estimates of future investment performance  projected credit impairments on the invested assets and performance of the blocks of life insurance business  at december   the company established a case reserve of million for the ballantyne transaction 
this case reserve reflects expected losses resulting primarily from the deterioration in the investment portfolio as discussed above 
at this time we do not expect the shut off triggers or recaptures by cedants discussed above to occur 
should these events occur our losses could be significantly greater than our case reserve 
the company has not established a case loss reserve for the orkney re ii transaction 
on december   the company sued jp morgan investment management inc jpmim  the investment manager in the orkney ii transaction  in new york supreme court alleging that jpmim engaged in breaches of fiduciary duty  gross negligence and breaches of contract based upon its handling of the investments of orkney re ii 
jpmim requested and was given an extension of time to answer until the end of february 
the company has exposure to a public finance transaction for sewer service in jefferson county  alabama through several reinsurance treaties 
the company s total exposure to this transaction is approximately million as of december  the company has made debt service payments during the year and expects to make additional payments in the near term 
through our cedants  the company is currently in discussions with the bond issuer to structure a solution  which may result in some or all of these payments being recoverable 
a case reserve of million has been established as of december  a sensitivity analysis is not appropriate for our other segment reserves since the amounts are reinsured 
we also record ibnr reserves for our other segment 
ibnr is an estimate of losses for which the insured event has occurred but the claim has not yet been reported to us 
in establishing ibnr  we use traditional actuarial methods to estimate the reporting lag of such claims based on historical experience  claim reviews and information reported by ceding companies 
we record ibnr for trade credit reinsurance within our other segment  which is reinsured 
the other segment represents lines of business that we exited or sold as part of our ipo 
for mortgage guaranty transactions we record portfolio reserves in a manner consistent with our financial guaranty business 
while other mortgage guaranty insurance companies do not record portfolio reserves  rather just case and ibnr reserves  we record portfolio reserves because we write business on an excess of loss basis  while other industry participants write quota share or first layer loss business 
we manage and underwrite this business in the same manner as our financial guaranty 
table of contents insurance and reinsurance business because they have similar characteristics as insured obligations of mortgage backed securities 
statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises fas is the authoritative guidance for an insurance enterprise 
fas prescribes differing reserving methodologies depending on whether a contract fits within its definition of a short duration contract or a long duration contract 
financial guaranty contracts have elements of long duration insurance contracts in that they are irrevocable and extend over a period that may exceed years or more  but for regulatory purposes are reported as property and liability insurance  which are normally considered short duration contracts 
the short duration and long duration classifications have different methods of accounting for premium revenue and contract liability recognition 
additionally  the accounting for deferred acquisition costs dac could be different under the two methods 
we believe the guidance of fas does not expressly address the distinctive characteristics of financial guaranty insurance  so we also apply the analogous guidance of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 recognition of fees for guaranteeing a loan eitf  which provides guidance relating to the recognition of fees for guaranteeing a loan  which has similarities to financial guaranty insurance contracts 
under the guidance in eitf  the guarantor should assess the probability of loss on an ongoing basis to determine if a liability should be recognized under fas no 
 accounting for contingencies fas 
fas requires that a loss be recognized where it is probable that one or more future events will occur confirming that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated

the company s scale is comparable to that of the nationally recognized rating agencies 
the super senior category  which is not generally used by rating agencies  is used by the company in instances where the company s aaa rated exposure has additional credit enhancement due to either the existence of another security rated aaa that is subordinated to the company s exposure or the company s exposure benefits from a different form of credit enhancement that would pay any claims first in the event that any of the

the closely monitored credits also include investment grade ig risks where credit quality is deteriorating and where  in the view of the company  there is significant potential that the risk quality will fall below investment grade

industry methodology the company is aware that there are certain differences regarding the measurement of portfolio loss liabilities among companies in the financial guaranty industry 
in january and february  the securities and exchange commission sec staff had discussions concerning these differences with a number of industry participants 
based on those discussions  in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb staff decided additional guidance is necessary regarding financial guaranty contracts 
in may  the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for financial guarantee insurance contracts an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas requires that an insurance enterprise recognize a claim liability prior to an event of default insured event when there is evidence that credit deterioration has occurred in an insured financial obligation 
fas also clarifies the methodology to be used for financial guaranty premium revenue recognition and claim liability measurement as well as requiring expanded disclosures about the insurance enterprise s risk management activities 
the provisions of fas related to premium revenue recognition and claim liability measurement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and all interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application of these provisions is not permitted 
the expanded risk management activity disclosure provisions of fas are effective for the third quarter of and are included in note significant risk management activities to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
fas will be applied to all existing and future financial guaranty insurance contracts written by us 
the cumulative effect of initially applying fas will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of january  the adoption of fas is expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
we are in the process of estimating the impact of the adoption of fas we will continue to follow our existing accounting policies in regards to premium revenue recognition and claim liability measurement until we complete our first quarter financial statements 
reclassification effective with the quarter ended march   we reclassified the revenues  expenses and balance sheet items associated with financial guaranty contracts that our financial guaranty subsidiaries write in the form of cds contracts 
the reclassification does not change our net income loss or shareholder s equity 
this reclassification is being adopted by us after agreement with member companies of the association of financial guaranty insurers in consultation with the staffs of the office of the chief accountant and the division of corporate finance of the securities and exchange commission 
the reclassification is being implemented in order to increase comparability of our financial statements with other financial guaranty companies that have cds contracts 
our cds contracts provide for credit protection against payment default and have substantially the same terms and conditions as its financial guaranty insurance contracts 
under united states generally accepted accounting principles  however  cds contracts are subject to derivative accounting rules and financial guaranty policies are subject to insurance accounting rules 
in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  we have reclassified cds revenues from net earned premiums to realized gains and other settlements on credit derivatives 
loss and loss adjustment expenses and recoveries that were previously included in loss and loss adjustment expenses recoveries will be reclassified to realized gains and other settlements on credit derivatives  as well 
portfolio and case loss and loss adjustment expenses will be reclassified from loss and loss adjustment expenses recoveries and will be included in unrealized 
table of contents gains losses on credit derivatives  which previously included only unrealized mark to market gains or losses on our contracts written in cds form 
in the consolidated balance sheet  we reclassified all cds related balances previously included in unearned premium reserves  reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  prepaid reinsurance premiums  premiums receivable and reinsurance balances payable to either credit derivative liabilities or credit derivative assets  depending on the net position of the cds contract at each balance sheet date 
fair value of credit derivatives the company follows fas  fas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities fas and fas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments fas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and fas no 
fair value measurements fas  which establishes a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value 
fas and fas require recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
fas defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
fas also requires an entity maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
the price shall represent that available in the principal market for the asset or liability 
if there is no principal market  then the price is based on the market that maximizes the value received for an asset or minimizes the amount paid for a liability ie the most advantageous market 
fas specifies a fair value hierarchy based on whether the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable 
observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect company based market assumptions 
in accordance with fas  the fair value hierarchy prioritizes model inputs into three broad levels as follows level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and observable inputs other than quoted prices  such as interest rates or yield curves and other inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market inputs 
level model derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable 
this hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available 
an asset or liability s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation 
we issue credit derivatives that we view as an extension of our financial guaranty business but that do not qualify for the financial guaranty insurance scope exception under fas and fas and therefore are reported at fair value  with changes in fair value included in our earnings 
our realized gains and other settlements on credit derivatives include credit derivative premiums received and receivable  credit derivative losses paid and payable and realized gains or losses due to early terminations and ceding commissions expense income 
credit derivative premiums and ceding commissions expense income are earned over the life of the transaction 
claim payments or recoveries are related to credit events requiring payment by or to us under the credit derivative 
table of contents contract 
realized gains or losses are recorded related to the early termination of credit derivative contracts 
our unrealized gains and losses on credit derivatives represent changes in fair value of these instruments that are required to be recorded under fas the unrealized gains and losses on credit derivatives will reduce to zero as the exposure approaches its maturity date  unless there is a payment default on the exposure 
however  in the event that we terminate a credit derivative contract prior to maturity the unrealized gain or loss will be realized through realized gains or losses and other settlements on credit derivatives 
changes in the fair value of our credit derivative contracts do not reflect actual claims or credit losses  and have no impact on the company s claims paying resources  rating agency capital or regulatory capital positions or debt covenants 
we do not typically exit our credit derivative contracts and there are not quoted prices for our instruments or similar instruments 
observable inputs other than quoted market prices exist  however  these inputs reflect contracts that do not contain terms and conditions similar to the credit derivatives issued by us 
therefore  the valuation of our credit derivative contracts requires the use of models that contain significant  unobservable inputs 
thus  we believe that our credit derivative contract valuations are in level in the fair value hierarchy of fas the fair value of these instruments represents the difference between the present value of remaining contractual premiums charged for the credit protection and the estimated present value of premiums that a comparable financial guarantor would hypothetically charge for the same protection at the balance sheet date 
the fair value of these contracts depends on a number of factors including notional amount of the contract  expected term  credit spreads  changes in interest rates  the credit ratings of the referenced entities  our own credit risk and remaining contractual flows 
remaining contractual cash flows  which are included in the realized gains and other settlements on credit derivatives component of credit derivatives  are the most readily observable variables since they are based on the cds contractual terms 
these variables include i net premiums received and receivable on written credit derivative contracts  ii net premiums paid and payable on purchased contracts  iii losses paid and payable to credit derivative contract counterparties and iv losses recovered and recoverable on purchased contracts 
the remaining key variables described above impact unrealized gains losses on credit derivatives 
market conditions at december  were such that market prices for our cds contracts were generally not available 
where market prices were not available  we used a combination of observable market data and valuation models  including various market indexes  credit spreads  our own credit risk and estimated contractual payments to estimate the fair value of the company s credit derivatives 
these models are primarily developed internally based on market conventions for similar transactions 
management considers the non standard terms of its credit derivative contracts in determining the fair value of these contracts 
these terms differ from credit derivatives sold by companies outside of the financial guaranty industry 
the non standard terms include the absence of collateral support agreements or immediate settlement provisions  relatively high attachment points and the fact that the company does not exit derivatives it sells for credit protection purposes  except under specific circumstances such as exiting a line of business 
because of these terms and conditions  the fair value of the company s credit derivatives may not reflect the same prices observed in an actively traded market of credit default swaps that do not contain terms and conditions similar to those observed in the financial guaranty market 
these models and the related assumptions are continuously reevaluated by management and enhanced  as appropriate  based upon improvements in modeling techniques and availability of more timely market information 
table of contents valuation models include the use of management estimates and current market information 
management is also required to make assumptions on how the fair value of credit derivative instruments is affected by current market conditions 
management considers factors such as current prices charged for similar agreements  performance of underlying assets  life of the instrument  and the extent of credit default swaps exposure the company ceded under reinsurance agreements  and the nature and extent of activity in the financial guaranty credit derivative marketplace 
the assumptions that management uses to determine its fair value may change in the future due to market conditions 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the assumptions used in the valuation models to determine the fair value of these credit derivative products  actual experience may differ from the estimates reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  and the differences may be material 
the fair value adjustment excluding incurred losses on credit derivatives recognized in our statement of operations for the year ended december  was a million gain compared with a million loss for the year ended december  and a million loss for the year ended december  the gain includes a gain of  million associated with the change in agc s credit spread  which widened substantially from basis points at december  to  basis points at december  management believes that the widening of agc s credit spread is due to the correlation between agc s risk profile and that experienced currently by the broader financial markets and increased demand for credit protection against agc as the result of its increased business volume 
offsetting the gain attributable to the significant increase in agc s credit spread were declines in fixed income security market prices primarily attributable to widening spreads in certain markets as a result of the continued deterioration in credit markets and some credit rating downgrades  rather than from delinquencies or defaults on securities guaranteed by the company 
the higher credit spreads in the fixed income security market are due to the recent lack of liquidity in the high yield collateralized debt obligation and collateralized loan obligation markets as well as continuing market concerns over the most recent vintages of subprime residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities 
the loss is primarily related to spreads widening and includes no credit losses 
for the year ended  approximately of the company s unrealized loss on credit derivatives was due to a decline in the market value of high yield and investment grade corporate collateralized loan obligation transactions  with the balance generated by lower market values principally in the residential and commercial mortgage backed securities markets 
the loss of million is primarily related to the run off of transactions and changes in credit spreads 
with considerable volatility continuing in the market  the fair value adjustment amount will fluctuate significantly in future periods 
fair value of committed capital securities ccs the fair value of ccs securities represents the present value of remaining expected put option premium payments under the ccs securities agreements and the value of such estimated payments based upon the quoted price for such premium payments as of december  and the million and million fair value asset for ccs securities as of december  and  respectively  is included in the consolidated balance sheets

valuation of investments as of december  and  we had total investments of billion and billion  respectively 
the fair values of all of our investments are calculated from independent market valuations 
the fair values of the company s us treasury securities are primarily determined based 
table of contents upon broker dealer quotes obtained from several independent active market makers 
the fair values of the company s portfolio other than us treasury securities are determined primarily using matrix pricing models 
the matrix pricing models incorporate factors such as tranche type  collateral coupons  average life  payment speeds  and spreads  in order to calculate the fair values of specific securities owned by the company 
as of december   under fas  all of our fixed maturity securities were classified as level and our short term investments were classified as either level or level as of december   approximately of our investments were long term fixed maturity securities  and our portfolio had an average duration of years  compared with and years as of december  changes in interest rates affect the value of our fixed maturity portfolio 
as interest rates fall  the fair value of fixed maturity securities increases and as interest rates rise  the fair value of fixed maturity securities decreases 
the company s portfolio is comprised primarily of high quality  liquid instruments 
we continue to receive sufficient information to value our investments and have not had to modify our approach due to the current market conditions 
the following table summarizes the estimated change in fair value on our investment portfolio as of december  based upon an assumed parallel shift in interest rates across the entire yield curve change in interest rates estimated increase decrease in fair value in millions basis point rise basis point rise basis point rise basis point decline basis point decline basis point decline see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for more information 
other than temporary impairments we have a formal review process for all securities in our investment portfolio  including a review for impairment losses 
factors considered when assessing impairment include a decline in the market value of a security by or more below amortized cost for a continuous period of at least six months  a decline in the market value of a security for a continuous period of months  recent credit downgrades of the applicable security or the issuer by rating agencies  the financial condition of the applicable issuer  whether scheduled interest payments are past due  and whether we have the ability and intent to hold the security for a sufficient period of time to allow for anticipated recoveries in fair value 
if we believe a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary  we record the decline as an unrealized loss on our balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income in 
table of contents shareholders equity 
if we believe the decline is other than temporary  we write down the carrying value of the investment and record a realized loss in our statement of operations 
in periods subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment  the impaired security is accounted for as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the impairment 
accordingly  the discount or reduced premium based on the new cost basis is accreted into net investment income in future periods based upon the amount and timing of expected future cash flows of the security  if the recoverable value of the investment based upon those cash flows is greater than the carrying value of the investment after the impairment 
our assessment of a decline in value includes management s current assessment of the factors noted above 
if that assessment changes in the future  we may ultimately record a loss after having originally concluded that the decline in value was temporary 
as part of our other than temporary impairment review process  we consider the nature of the investment  the cause for the impairment interest or credit related  the severity both as a percentage of book value and absolute dollars and duration of the impairment and any other available evidence  such as discussions with investment advisors  volatility of the securities fair value  recent news reports  etc  when performing our assessment 
the company recognized million of other than temporary impairment losses substantially related to mortgage backed and corporate securities for the year ended december  primarily due to the fact that it does not have the intent to hold these securities until there is a recovery in their value 
the company continues to monitor the value of these investments 
future events may result in further impairment of the company s investments 
the company had no write downs of investments for other than temporary impairment losses for the years ended december  and as of december   excluding the securities described above  the company s gross unrealized loss position stood at million compared to million at december  the million increase in gross unrealized losses was primarily attributable to mortgage and asset backed securities  million  municipal securities  million  and corporate securities  million 
the increase in these unrealized losses during the year ended december  was related to the overall illiquidity in the financial markets and resulted in a sudden and severe depressed demand for non cash investments 
as of december   the company had securities in an unrealized loss position for greater than months  representing a gross unrealized loss of million 
of these securities  securities had unrealized losses greater than of book value 
the total unrealized loss for these securities as of december  was million 
this unrealized loss is primarily attributable to the market illiquidity and volatility in the us economy mentioned above and not specific to individual issuer credit 
except as noted below  the company has recognized no other than temporary impairment losses and has the ability and intent to hold these securities until a recovery in value

upfront premiums are earned in proportion to the expiration of the amount at risk 
each installment premium is earned ratably over its installment period  generally one year or less 
premium earnings under both the upfront and installment revenue recognition methods are based upon and are in proportion to the principal amount guaranteed and therefore result in higher premium earnings during periods where guaranteed principal is higher 
for insured bonds for which the par value outstanding is declining during the insurance 
table of contents period  upfront premium earnings are greater in the earlier periods thus matching revenue recognition with the underlying risk 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our gross written premiums were received upfront  and  and  respectively  were received in installments 
the premiums are allocated in accordance with the principal amortization schedule of the related bond issue and are earned ratably over the amortization period 
when an insured issue is retired early  is called by the issuer  or is in substance paid in advance through a refunding accomplished by placing us government securities in escrow  the remaining unearned premium reserves are earned at that time 
unearned premium reserves represent the portion of premiums written that is applicable to the unexpired amount at risk of insured bonds 
in our reinsurance businesses  we estimate the ultimate written and earned premiums to be received from a ceding company at the end of each quarter and the end of each year because some of our ceding companies report premium data anywhere from to days after the end of the relevant period 
written premiums reported in our statement of operations are based upon reports received from ceding companies supplemented by our own estimates of premium for which ceding company reports have not yet been received 
as of december   and the assumed premium estimate and related ceding commissions included in our consolidated financial statements are million and million  million and million and million and million  respectively 
key assumptions used to arrive at management s best estimate of assumed premiums are premium amounts reported historically and informal communications with ceding companies 
differences between such estimates and actual amounts are recorded in the period in which the actual amounts are determined 
historically  the differences have not been material 
we do not record a provision for doubtful accounts related to our assumed premium estimate 
historically there have not been any material issues related to the collectibility of assumed premium 
no provision for doubtful accounts related to our premium receivable was recorded for  or deferred acquisition costs acquisition costs incurred  other than those associated with credit derivative products  that vary with and are directly related to the production of new business are deferred and amortized in relation to earned premiums 
these costs include direct and indirect expenses such as ceding commissions  brokerage expenses and the cost of underwriting and marketing personnel 
as of december  and  we had deferred acquisition costs of million and million  respectively 
ceding commissions paid to primary insurers are the largest component of deferred acquisition costs  constituting and of total deferred acquisition costs as of december  and  respectively 
management uses its judgment in determining what types of costs should be deferred  as well as what percentage of these costs should be deferred 
we annually conduct a study to determine which operating costs vary with  and are directly related to  the acquisition of new business and qualify for deferral 
ceding commissions received on premiums we cede to other reinsurers reduce acquisition costs 
anticipated losses  lae and the remaining costs of servicing the insured or reinsured business are considered in determining the recoverability of acquisition costs 
acquisition costs associated with credit derivative products are expensed as incurred 
when an insured issue is retired early  as discussed in the premium revenue recognition section of these critical accounting estimates  the remaining related deferred acquisition cost is expensed at that time 
deferred income taxes as of december  and  we had a net deferred income tax asset of million and a net deferred income tax asset of million  respectively

fin  on january  as a result of the adoption of fin  the company reduced its liability for unrecognized tax benefits and increased retained earnings by million 
the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of january  was million 
this entire amount  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
subsequent to the adoption of fin  the irs published final regulations on the treatment of consolidated losses

table of contents company decreased its liability for unrecognized tax benefits and its provision for income taxes million during the period ended march  in september  upon completion of the irs audit of assured guaranty overseas us holdings inc and subsidiaries  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was reduced by approximately million 
the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of december  and was million and million  respectively  and is included in other liabilities on the balance sheets 
during the year ended december  the net liability increased by approximately million due to a position management intends to take on the company s tax return

liability for tax basis step up adjustment in connection with the ipo  the company and ace financial services inc afs  a subsidiary of ace  entered into a tax allocation agreement  whereby the company and afs made a section h election that has the effect of increasing the tax basis of certain affected subsidiaries tangible and intangible assets to fair value 
future tax benefits that the company derives from the election will be payable to afs when realized by the company 
as a result of the election  the company has adjusted its net deferred tax liability to reflect the new tax basis of the company s affected assets 
the additional basis is expected to result in increased future income tax deductions and  accordingly  may reduce income taxes otherwise payable by the company 
any tax benefit realized by the company will be paid to afs 
such tax benefits will generally be calculated by comparing the company s affected subsidiaries actual taxes to the taxes that would have been owed by those subsidiaries had the increase in basis not occurred 
after a year period  to the extent there remains an unrealized tax benefit  the company and afs will negotiate a settlement of the unrealized benefit based on the expected realization at that time 
the company initially recorded a million reduction of its existing deferred tax liability  based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of the section h election 
under the tax allocation agreement  the company estimated that  as of the ipo date  it was obligated to pay million to afs and accordingly established this amount as a liability 
the initial difference  which is attributable to the change in the tax basis of certain liabilities for which there is no associated step up in the tax basis of its assets and no amounts due to afs  resulted in an increase to additional paid in capital of million 
as of december  and  the liability for tax basis step up adjustment  which is included in the company s balance sheets in other liabilities  was million and million  respectively 
the company has paid ace and correspondingly reduced its liability by million and million in and  respectively

performance retention plan 
this plan permits the award of cash based awards to selected employees which vest after four years of continued employment or earlier  if the employee s termination occurs as a result of death  disability  or retirement

table of contents goodwill in connection with fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company does not amortize goodwill  but instead is required to perform an impairment test annually or more frequently should circumstances warrant 
the impairment test evaluates goodwill for recoverability by comparing the fair value of the company s direct and reinsurance lines of business to their carrying value 
if fair value is greater than carrying value then goodwill is deemed to be recoverable and there is no impairment 
if fair value is less than carrying value then goodwill is deemed to be impaired and written down by an amount such that the fair value of the reporting unit is equal to the carrying value  but not less than no such impairment to goodwill was recognized in the years ended december   or as part of the impairment test of goodwill  there are inherent assumptions and estimates used by management in developing discounted future cash flows related to our direct and reinsurance lines of business that are subject to change based on future events 
management s estimates include projecting earned premium  incurred losses  expenses  interest rates  cost of capital and tax rates 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods 
these changes can result in future impairments 
the company has concluded that it is reasonably likely that the goodwill associated with our reinsurance line of business could become impaired in future periods if the volume of new business in the financial guaranty reinsurance market does not return to historical levels experienced prior to or if the company is not able to continue to execute portfolio based reinsurance contracts on blocks of business for other financial guarantors in financial distress 
also  the pending fsah transaction may cause a triggering event that will cause management to reassess its goodwill amounts related to its reinsurance line of business

the change in fair value for was attributable to spreads widening and includes no credit losses 
for the year ended  approximately of the company s unrealized loss on credit derivatives was due to a decline in the market value of high yield and investment grade corporate collateralized loan obligation transactions  with the balance generated by lower market values principally in the residential and commercial mortgage backed securities markets 
changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts do not reflect actual claims or credit losses  and have no impact on the company s claims paying resources  rating agency capital or regulatory capital positions 
with considerable volatility continuing in the market  the fair value adjustment amount will fluctuate significantly in future periods 
the change in fair value of million for was related to many factors but primarily due to run off of transactions and tightening in credit spreads 
unrealized gains losses on credit derivatives  excluding incurred losses on credit derivatives  net of related income taxes  were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the gain or loss created by the estimated fair value adjustment will rise or fall based on estimated market pricing and may not be an indication of ultimate claims 
fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
we enter into credit derivative contracts which require us to make payments upon the occurrence of certain defined credit events relating to an underlying obligation generally a fixed income obligation 
the company s credit derivative exposures are substantially similar to its financial guaranty insurance contracts and provide for credit protection against payment default 
they are contracts that are generally held to maturity 
the unrealized gains and losses on credit derivatives will reduce to zero as the exposure approaches its maturity date  unless there is a payment default on the exposure 

table of contents management also calculates portfolio and case reserve expenses on our credit derivative contracts in the same manner as we do for our financial guaranty insurance contracts 
prior to the first quarter  incurred losses on credit derivatives were apportioned in our financial statements from unrealized gains losses on credit derivatives and included in loss and loss adjustment expenses 
as a result of reclassifying our accounting activity related to credit derivative contracts commencing with the first quarter  we no longer make this apportionment in our financial statements  but believe it is an important metric in evaluating the credit quality of our credit derivative contracts 
the incurred losses gains on credit derivatives were million million loss after tax  million million loss after tax and million million after tax for the years ended december   and  respectively

financial guaranty direct segment the financial guaranty direct segment consists of our primary financial guaranty insurance business and our credit derivative business 
financial guaranty insurance provides an unconditional and irrevocable guaranty that protects the holder of a financial obligation against non payment of principal and interest when due 
financial guaranty insurance may be issued to the holders of the insured obligations at the time of issuance of those obligations  or may be issued in the secondary market to holders of public bonds and structured securities 
as an alternative to traditional financial guaranty insurance  credit protection on a particular security or issuer can also be provided through a credit derivative  such as a credit default swap 
under a credit default swap  the seller of protection makes a specified payment to the buyer of protection upon the occurrence of one or more specified credit events with respect to a reference obligation or a particular reference entity 
credit derivatives typically provide protection to a buyer rather than credit enhancement of an issue as in traditional financial guaranty insurance

market risk market risk represents the potential for losses that may result from changes in the value of a financial instrument as a result of changes in market conditions 
the primary market risks that impact the value of our financial instruments are interest rate risk  basis risk  such as taxable interest rates relative to tax exempt interest rates  and credit spread risk 
each of these risks and the specific types of financial instruments impacted are described below 
senior managers in our surveillance department 
table of contents are responsible for monitoring risk limits and applying risk measurement methodologies 
the estimation of potential losses arising from adverse changes in market conditions is a key element in managing market risk 
we use various systems  models and stress test scenarios to monitor and manage market risk 
these models include estimates made by management that use current and historic market information 
the valuation results from these models could differ materially from amounts that actually are realized in the market 
see critical accounting estimates valuation of investments 
financial instruments that may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates consist primarily of investment securities 
the primary objective in managing our investment portfolio is generation of an optimal level of after tax investment income while preserving capital and maintaining adequate liquidity 
investment strategies are based on many factors  including our tax position  fluctuation in interest rates  regulatory and rating agency criteria and other market factors 
as of january  we have retained blackrock financial management  inc to manage our investment portfolio 
these investment managers manage our fixed maturity investment portfolio in accordance with investment guidelines approved by our board of directors 
financial instruments that may be adversely affected by changes in credit spreads consist primarily of assured guaranty s outstanding credit derivative contracts 
we enter into credit derivative contracts which require us to make payments upon the occurrence of certain defined credit events relating to an underlying obligation generally a fixed income obligation 
the company s credit derivative exposures are substantially similar to its financial guaranty insurance contracts and provide for credit protection against payment default  and are generally not subject to collateral calls due to changes in market value 
in general  the company structures credit derivative transactions such that the circumstances giving rise to our obligation to make loss payments is similar to that for financial guaranty insurance policies and only occurs as losses are realized on the underlying reference obligation 
nonetheless  credit derivative transactions are governed by international swaps and derivatives association  inc isda documentation and operate differently from financial guaranty insurance policies 
for example  our control rights with respect to a reference obligation under a credit derivative may be more limited than when we issue a financial guaranty policy on a direct primary basis 
in addition  while our exposure under credit derivatives  like our exposure under financial guaranty policies  has been generally for as long as the reference obligation remains outstanding  unlike financial guaranty insurance policies  a credit derivative may be terminated for a breach of the isda documentation or other specific events 
in some older credit derivative transactions  one such specified event is the failure of agc to maintain specified financial strength ratings ranging from aa to bbb 
if a credit derivative is terminated we could be required to make a mark to market payment as determined under the isda documentation 
for example  if agc s rating were downgraded to a  under market conditions at december   if the counterparties exercised their right to terminate their credit derivatives  agc would have been required make payments that the company estimates to be approximately million 
further  if agc s rating was downgraded to levels between bbb and bb it would have been required to make additional payments that the company estimates to be approximately million at december  under a limited number of credit derivative contracts  the company is required to post eligible securities as collateral  generally cash or us government or agency securities 
the need to post collateral under these transactions is generally based on mark to market valuation in excess of contractual thresholds 
the particular thresholds decline if the company ratings decline 
as of december  the company had pre ipo transactions with approximately billion of par subject to collateral posting due to changes in market value 
of this amount  as of december   the company posted collateral totaling approximately million including million for agc based on the unrealized mark to market loss position for transactions with two of its counterparties 
any amounts required to be posted as collateral in the future will depend on changes in the market values of these transactions 
additionally  in the event agc were downgraded below a  contractual 
table of contents thresholds would be eliminated and the amount of par that could be subject to collateral posting requirements would be billion 
based on market values as of december   such a downgrade would have resulted in agc posting an additional million of collateral 
currently no additional collateral posting is required or anticipated for any other transactions 
unrealized gains and losses on credit derivatives are a function of changes in the estimated fair value of our credit derivative contracts 
if credit spreads of the underlying obligations change  the fair value of the related credit derivative changes 
market liquidity could also impact valuations of the underlying obligations 
as such  assured guaranty experiences mark to market gains or losses 
we consider the impact of our own credit risk  in collaboration with credit spreads on risk that we assume through cds contracts  in determining the fair value of our credit derivatives 
we determine our own credit risk based on quoted cds prices traded on the company at each balance sheet date 
the quoted price of cds contracts traded on agc at december  and december  was  basis points and basis points  respectively 
the price of cds traded on the company generally moves directionally the same as general market spreads 
a widening of the cds prices traded on the company has an effect of offsetting unrealized losses that result from widening general market credit spreads 
thus  as the company s credit spreads widen  the value of our cds decreases 
conversely  as our own credit spread narrows  the value of our unrealized losses widens 
however  an overall narrowing of spreads generally results in an unrealized gain on credit derivatives for us and a widening of spreads generally results in an unrealized loss for us 
the impact of changes in credit spreads will vary based upon the volume  tenor  interest rates  and other market conditions at the time these fair values are determined 
in addition  since each transaction has unique collateral and structure terms  the underlying change in fair value of each transaction may vary considerably 
the fair value of credit derivatives also reflects the change in our own credit cost based on the price to purchase credit protection on agc 
during the year ended december   we incurred net pre tax unrealized gains on credit derivative contracts of million 
the gain includes a gain of  million associated with the change in agc s credit spread  which widened substantially from basis points at december  to  basis points at december  management believes that the widening of agc s credit spread is due to the correlation between agc s risk profile and that experienced currently by the broader financial markets 
offsetting the gain attributable to the significant increase in agc s credit spread were declines in fixed income security market prices primarily attributable to widening spreads in certain markets as a result of the continued deterioration in credit markets and some credit rating downgrades  rather than from delinquencies or defaults on securities guaranteed by the company 
the higher credit spreads in the fixed income security market are due to the recent lack of liquidity in the high yield collateralized debt obligation and collateralized loan obligation markets as well as continuing market concerns over the most recent vintages of subprime residential mortgage backed securities 
the total notional amount of credit derivative exposure outstanding as of december  and december  and included in our financial guaranty exposure was billion and billion  respectively 
we generally hold these credit derivative contracts to maturity 
the unrealized gains and losses on credit derivatives will reduce to zero as the exposure approaches its maturity date  unless there is a payment default on the exposure
