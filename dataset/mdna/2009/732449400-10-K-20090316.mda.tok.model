item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion of results of operations and liquidity and capital resources contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
as described under the heading important information regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of this report  our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and in the section above entitled risk factors 
unless otherwise indicated  all common stock related amounts have been adjusted to reflect our one for six reverse stock split effective september  critical accounting policies basis of revenue recognition to date  we do not have any significant ongoing revenue sources 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets as of december   we had net property and equipment of approximately million and a net intangible asset of approximately million  which represents capitalized payments for our picoplatin license 
in accounting for these long lived and intangible assets  we estimate the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on events or circumstances  such as changes in our business strategy and plans  a significant decrease in market value  a significant change in asset condition or a significant adverse change in regulatory climate 
specifically  the value of the picoplatin intangible asset could be impaired as a result of negative results of clinical trials or as a result of adverse decisions or rulings of regulatory bodies  such as the fda 
application of the test for impairment requires significant judgment  taking into account potentially unfavorable factors  such as those mentioned above  that could adversely affect the carrying value of the asset 
in june  we recognized an asset impairment loss of million on certain facilities and equipment resulting from the termination of our str program 
the loss on the equipment at the seattle facility was determined based on estimates of potential sales values of used equipment and other selling costs 
in december  we recognized an additional impairment loss of million on the str manufacturing facility in denton  texas  based on our evaluation of market data for this property  and classified this asset as a long term asset held for sale 
on october   we sold the denton facility  which resulted in net sales proceeds of million  with a net gain of million 
long term debt on september   we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement loan agreement  with ge healthcare financial services formerly known as merrill lynch capital and silicon valley bank 
the loan agreement amends and restates in its entirety the earlier loan and security agreement dated as of october  original loan  with merrill lynch capital and silicon valley bank  pursuant to which we obtained a million capital loan that was to mature on april  the loan agreement provides for a senior secured term loan facility loan facility to be made available as follows i an initial term loan advance in the amount of million  which was comprised of a the outstanding principal balance of million remaining on the original loan and b an additional cash advance of approximately million cash portion  which was fully funded on september   and ii a second term loan advance in the amount of million  which was fully funded on september  the advances under the loan facility are repayable over months  commencing on october  interest on the advances is fixed at per annum 
final loan payments in the amounts of million and million are due upon maturity or earlier repayment of the initial term loan advance and the second term loan advance  respectively 
additionally  as a condition to the amendment and restatement of the original loan  we agreed to modification of the final payment obligations under the original loan  pursuant to which we paid million to silicon valley bank on september   the effective date of the loan facility  and will pay million to ge healthcare financial services on the earlier of march  or the date of repayment of the loan facility 
all final payment amounts will be accreted to the note payable balance over the term of the loan facility using the effective interest rate method and reflected as additional interest expense 
all interest payable under the loan agreement and the full amount of the final payments must be paid upon any prepayment of a term loan advance 
the loan facility is secured by a first lien on all of our non intellectual property assets 
in connection with the loan agreement  we issued to the lenders ten year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the portion of the loan proceeds allocable to the warrants is approximately million based on the relative fair value of the warrants  which we recorded as additional discount to notes payable 
we classify the portion of the loan that is due for payment in and thereafter as a long term payable 
stock compensation beginning january   we account for share based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payments  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
our employee stock options  however  have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options 
for example  employee stock options are generally subject to vesting restrictions and are generally not transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility  the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest 
changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option 
furthermore  the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee 
we use historical data  and other related information as appropriate  to estimate the expected price volatility  the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of a grant 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions  we may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense  which could be material to our results of operations 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues we had no revenue for the years ended december   and research and development research and development expenses increased to million in and increased to million in our research and development expenses are summarized as follows annual percentage change in thousands research contract manufacturing clinical share based compensation total research expenses include  among other things  personnel  occupancy and external laboratory expenses associated with the discovery and identification of new therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer 
research expenses also include research activities associated with our product candidate  picoplatin  including formulation and in vitro and in vivo studies 
research expenses increased to million in primarily due to higher personnel and laboratory supply costs  offset by reduced outside laboratory costs 
research expenses increased to million in  largely as a result of higher personnel  collaborative research fees  laboratory supplies and occupancy costs 
contract manufacturing expenses include personnel and occupancy expenses and external contract manufacturing costs for the scale up and manufacturing of drug product for use in our clinical trials  in addition to drug product stability and toxicology studies 
contract manufacturing costs increased to million in  due to slightly higher personnel costs 
contract manufacturing costs increased to million in  primarily due to higher personnel costs and increased drug product production 
clinical expenses include personnel expenses  travel  occupancy costs and external clinical trial costs  including clinical research organization charges  principal investigator fees  clinical site expenses and regulatory activities associated with conducting human clinical trials 
clinical expenses also include quality control and assurance activities  such as storage and shipment services for our drug product candidates 
clinical costs increased to million in  due to primarily to expanded external clinical trial costs associated with our picoplatin trials and increased personnel costs 
clinical costs increased to million in  principally due to increased external costs related to the initiation of our phase iii trial of picoplatin in small cell lung cancer 
share based compensation expenses reflect the non cash charge relating to the adoption of fas r on january   under which the fair value of all employee share based payments is charged to expense over the vesting period of the stock option 
share based compensation expense increased to million in  primarily as a result of a higher number of stock option grants reflecting higher staffing levels 
share based compensation expense increased to million in  primarily due to the recognition of expense for option grants that were awarded in and approved by shareholders in our major research and development program during the fiscal years ended december   and was picoplatin 
picoplatin is a new generation platinum based chemotherapeutic designed to overcome platinum resistance in the treatment of solid tumors 
we completed patient enrollment in our phase ii clinical study of picoplatin in small cell lung cancer in august and  based on positive median overall survival data from that ongoing study  we initiated a phase iii pivotal trial of picoplatin in small cell lung cancer in april in may  we treated our first patients in separate phase i ii studies evaluating picoplatin as a first line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer and hormone refractory prostate cancer 
we initiated the phase ii component of our prostate cancer study in july and completed enrollment in december we initiated enrollment in the phase ii component of our colorectal cancer study in november and completed enrollment in may we also initiated a phase i study of an oral formulation of picoplatin in advanced solid tumors in april as of december   we have incurred external costs of approximately million in connection with our entire picoplatin clinical program 
total estimated future costs of our picoplatin phase ii and phase iii trials in small cell lung cancer are in the ranges of million to million and million to million  respectively  through  including the cost of drug supply 
total estimated future costs of our picoplatin phase ii trial in colorectal cancer and our phase ii trial in hormone refractory prostate cancer are in the ranges of million to million and million to million  respectively  through  including the cost of drug supply 
total estimated future costs of our phase i trial in oral picoplatin are in the range of million to million through  including the cost of drug supply 
these costs could be substantially higher if we have to repeat  revise or expand the scope of any of our trials 
material cash inflows relating to our picoplatin development will not commence unless and until we complete required clinical trials and obtain fda marketing approvals  and then only if picoplatin finds acceptance in the marketplace 
to date  we have not received any revenues from product sales of picoplatin 
recap of development and clinical program costs 
our development administration overhead costs  consisting of rent  utilities  consulting fees  patent costs and other various overhead costs  are included in total research and development expense for each period  but are not allocated among our various projects 
our total research and development costs include the costs of various research efforts directed toward the identification and evaluation of future product candidates 
these other research projects are preclinical and not considered major projects 
our total research and development costs are summarized below annual percentage change in thousands picoplatin discontinued programs other unallocated costs and overhead share based compensation total research and development costs the  represents costs related to the winding down of our str program that was discontinued in our external costs for picoplatin in and reflect costs associated with our various picoplatin clinical studies and the manufacture of drug product to support our clinical trials 
we expect our external costs for picoplatin to increase slightly in as we prepare for submission of our rolling nda application  offset by lower costs for clinical trials upon completion 
the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of picoplatin on schedule  or at all  include the following  as well as the other risks and uncertainties described in this report we may not have adequate funds to complete the development of picoplatin  picoplatin may not be shown to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials  and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals of the drug or may be unable to obtain such approvals on a timely basis 
if we fail to obtain marketing approvals for picoplatin  are unable to secure adequate commercial supplies of picoplatin active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product  or do not complete development and obtain united states and foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis  our operations  financial position and liquidity could be severely impaired  including as follows we would not earn any sales revenue from picoplatin  which would increase the likelihood that we would need to obtain additional financing for our other research and development efforts  and our reputation among investors might be harmed  which could make it more difficult for us to obtain equity capital on attractive terms  or at all 
because of the many risks and uncertainties relating to completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict the period in which material cash inflows from our picoplatin program will commence  if ever 
general and administrative annual percentage change in thousands general and administrative share based compensation total general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million in and increased to approximately million in general and administrative expenses  excluding share based compensation expense  increased in and increased in in  the increase was primarily attributable to personnel costs  resulting from increased headcount  and consulting 
the increase in was primarily due to personnel costs 
share based compensation expense in  and reflects non cash charges related to the adoption of fas r  under which the fair value of all employee share based payments is charged to expense over the vesting period of the stock option 
share based compensation expense increased in and increased in in  the increase was largely due to a higher number of stock option grants reflecting higher staffing levels 
the increase in was primarily due to the recognition of expense for option grants that were awarded in and approved by shareholders in other income and expense annual percentage change in thousands other income expense  net other income and expense decreased to approximately million in and increased to approximately million in the decrease in was primarily due to decreased average yields from our investment securities portfolio and increased interest costs resulting from additional borrowings in under our bank loan 
the increase in was primarily due to increases in our investment securities portfolio resulting from our and financings and to decreased interest expense during under our bank note payable 
liquidity and capital resources december  in thousands cash  cash equivalents and investment securities working capital shareholders equity years ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities we have historically experienced recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operations 
as of december   we had net working capital of million  an accumulated deficit of million and total shareholders equity of million 
we have financed our operations to date primarily through the sale of equity securities  debt instruments  technology licensing and collaborative agreements 
we invest excess cash in investment securities that will be used to fund future operating costs 
cash used for operating activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
there were no revenues and other income sources for the year ended december  we may not be able to obtain capital or enter into relationships with corporate partners on a timely basis  on favorable terms  or at all 
conditions in the capital markets in general  and in the life science capital market specifically  may affect our potential financing sources and opportunities for strategic partnering 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  assuming that we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
cash  cash equivalents and investment securities  net of restricted cash of million  totaled million at december  the report of our independent registered public accountants issued in connection with our annual report on form k for the year ended december  contains a statement expressing substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
on september   we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement loan agreement with ge healthcare financial services inc and silicon valley bank  establishing a million senior secured loan facility 
the loan agreement amends and restates our earlier loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank and merrill lynch capital dated as of october   pursuant to which we obtained a million capital loan that was to mature on april  original loan 
funds under the loan facility were made available as follows i an initial term loan advance in the amount of million  which was comprised of a the outstanding principal balance of million remaining on the original loan and b an additional cash advance of approximately million  which was fully funded on september   and ii a second term loan advance in the amount of million  which was fully funded on september  the advances under the loan facility are repayable over months  commencing on october  interest on the advances is fixed at per annum 
final payments in the amounts of million and million are due upon maturity or earlier repayment of the initial term loan advance and the second term loan advance  respectively 
additionally  as a condition to the amendment and restatement of the original loan  we agreed to modification of the final payment obligations under the original loan pursuant to which we paid million to silicon valley bank on september   the effective date of the loan facility  and will pay million to ge healthcare financial services on the earlier of march  or the date of repayment of the loan facility 
the loan facility is secured by a first lien on all of our non intellectual property assets 
the loan agreement contains restrictions on our ability to  among other things  dispose of certain assets  engage in certain mergers and acquisition transactions  incur indebtedness  create liens on assets  make investments  pay dividends and repurchase stock 
the loan agreement also contains covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum amount of unrestricted cash during the term of the loan equal to the lesser of i million or ii the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the term loans plus million 
the loan agreement contains events of default that include nonpayment of principal  interest or fees  breaches of covenants  material adverse changes  bankruptcy and insolvency events  cross defaults to any other indebtedness  material judgments  inaccuracy of representations and warranties and events constituting a change of control 
the occurrence of an event of default would increase the applicable rate of interest by and could result in the acceleration of our payment obligations under the loan agreement 
in connection with the loan agreement  we issued to the lenders ten year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
at december   the outstanding principal amount under the loan facility was million 
taking into account the minimum unrestricted cash requirement under the loan agreement and our projected operating results  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalent and investment securities balances will provide adequate resources to fund operations at least into the first quarter of however  given the uncertainties of outcomes of the company s ongoing clinical trials  there is no assurance that the company can achieve its projected operating results 
thereafter  unless we raise additional funds  we will be in default of the minimum unrestricted cash requirement and potentially other provisions of the loan agreement 
the occurrence of an event of default would increase the applicable rate of interest by and could result in the acceleration of our payment obligations under the loan agreement 
we have no assurance that  especially in light of the current distressed economic environment  the lenders will be willing to waive or renegotiate the terms of the loan agreement to address or avoid financial or other defaults 
if an event of default were to occur  we might not have sufficient funds to repay the loan or to fund our continuing operations 
in such case  we would need to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our picoplatin trials and commercialization efforts  reduce our workforce  license our picoplatin product candidates for development and commercialization by third parties  attempt to sell the company  cease operations or declare bankruptcy 
provisions of the loan agreement would limit our ability to dispose of certain assets  engage in certain mergers  incur certain indebtedness  make certain distributions and engage in certain investment activities without the prior consent of the lenders 
we have no assurance that we can obtain financing or otherwise raise additional funds  if at all  on terms acceptable to us or to our lenders 
we have entered into clinical supply agreements with heraeus and baxter  pursuant to which they produce picoplatin api and finished drug product  respectively  for our clinical trials 
manufacturing services under these clinical supply agreements are provided on a purchase order  fixed fee basis 
our api clinical supply agreement continues in effect until it is terminated by mutual agreement of the parties or by either party in accordance with its terms 
our finished drug product clinical supply agreement runs for an initial term ending december   and is subject to renewal for two additional one year terms  at our option 
the total aggregate cost of clinical supplies of picoplatin api and finished drug product for the year ended december  was million 
we believe that we presently have adequate supplies of picoplatin api and finished drug product to complete our current clinical trials 
we also have entered into a picoplatin api commercial supply agreement with heraeus in march and a finished drug product commercial supply agreement with baxter in november under these agreements  heraeus and baxter will produce picoplatin api and finished drug product  respectively  for commercial use 
manufacturing services are provided on a purchase order  fixed fee basis  subject to certain purchase price adjustments and minimum quantity requirements 
the costs to heraeus for the purchase and set up of dedicated equipment  estimated to be approximately million  will be repaid by us in the form of a surcharge on an agreed upon amount of the picoplatin api ordered and delivered on or before december  if we order and take delivery of less than the agreed upon amount of picoplatin api through december   we will be obligated to pay the balance of the dedicated equipment cost as of that date 
the api commercial supply agreement continues for an initial term ending december   and the finished drug product commercial supply agreement continues for an initial term ending november   in each case subject to extension 
on april   we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
net proceeds of the offering were million 
on april   we completed an equity financing  pursuant to which we issued to a group of institutional and other accredited investors an aggregate of million shares of common stock at a cash purchase price of per share 
investors in the equity financing also received five year warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we received million in net proceeds from the equity financing  which  along with the net proceeds received from our april public offering  we intend to use to fund our ongoing picoplatin clinical trials and commercialization efforts and for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
in connection with our equity financing  we entered into a letter agreement with texas state bank  pursuant to which we agreed to accelerate the maturity date of our promissory note with the bank to june  the texas state bank note  which was secured by our radiopharmaceutical manufacturing plant and other str assets located in denton  texas  had an adjustable interest rate equal to the bank prime rate reported in the wall street journal at may  
we paid off the outstanding balance of the note  million  on may  on october   we sold the denton property  which resulted in net sales proceeds of million  with a net gain of million 
we completed the relocation of our corporate headquarters to south san francisco in september we intend to maintain our current clinical and development and support activities in seattle 
the addition of  square feet of office and laboratory space leased in the south san francisco facility resulted in a substantial increase in our rent and operating costs 
the initial term under the lease agreement dated july  is months 
we may  upon written notice delivered at least nine months prior to expiration of the initial lease term  extend the lease for an additional three years  with rent payable at the then market rate 
monthly base rent during the first seven months of the lease averaged  during the construction of tenant improvements 
base rental payments under this lease are subject to annual adjustment based on the consumer price index in the san francisco metropolitan market cpi sfmm and a one time adjustment for reimbursement for tenant improvements 
monthly base rent was increased by  to  following the adjustment for the cpi sfmm and an additional  to  following the adjustment for the cpi sfmm 
in december  the company received approximately  as a tenant reimbursement that resulted in a further  increase in monthly base rent to  additional rental payments under this lease are paid based on the company s share of operating expenses of the project in which the leased facilities are located 
during the year ended december   we paid total rent base rent and additional rent based on our share of facility common operating expenses of million under the operating leases for our south san francisco headquarters facility and our seattle facility 
of this amount  million represents total aggregate minimum lease payments under these leases 
in april  we acquired the worldwide exclusive rights  excluding japan  to develop  manufacture and commercialize picoplatin from anormed  inc anormed was acquired by genzyme corporation in november under the terms of the original agreement  we paid a one time upfront payment of million in common stock and million in cash 
the original agreement provided for development and commercialization milestone payments of up to million  payable in cash or a combination of cash and common stock  and a royalty rate of up to of net product sales after regulatory approval 
the parties executed an amendment to the license agreement on september   modifying several key financial terms and expanding the licensed territory to include japan  thereby providing us worldwide rights 
in consideration of the amendment  we paid genzyme million in cash on october  and million in cash on march  the amendment eliminated million in development milestone payments to genzyme 
if we are successful in our efforts to commercialize picoplatin  we would  under our amended license agreement with genzyme corporation  be required to pay genzyme up to million in commercialization milestones upon the attainment of certain levels of annual net sales of picoplatin after regulatory approval 
genzyme also would be entitled to royalty payments of up to of annual net product sales 
finally  the amendment eliminated sharing of sublicense revenues with genzyme 
on august   we entered into a research funding and option agreement with the scripps research institute  or tsri 
under the agreement  as amended  we provided tsri an aggregate of million over a month period to fund research relating to synthesis and evaluation of novel small molecule  multi targeted protein kinase inhibitors as therapeutic agents  including the treatment of cancer 
we paid tsri total funding payments of approximately million in  million in and million in  all of which were charged to r d expense 
the amended agreement expired on december  in connection with our option under the amended agreement to negotiate a worldwide exclusive license including the rights to sublicense to develop and to commercialize any compounds arising from the collaboration  we executed a follow on agreement to license compounds that were discovered by tsri 
we have no assurance that the research funded under this arrangement  or any compounds arising from the collaboration  will be successful or ultimately will give rise to any viable product candidates 
we will require substantial additional funding to develop and commercialize picoplatin and to fund our operations 
management is continuously exploring financing alternatives  including raising additional capital through the public or private sale of equity or debt securities or through the establishment of credit or other funding facilities  and entering into strategic collaborations  which may include joint ventures or partnerships for product development and commercialization  merger  sale of assets or other similar transactions 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional cash when needed  we may be forced to reduce expenses through the delay  reduction or curtailment of our picoplatin development and commercialization activities or through other cost savings measures  including the sale of our company or sale of our assets 
our actual capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the costs of performing our obligations under our loan facility with ge healthcare financial services and silicon valley bank  including the cost of interest and other payment obligations and penalties and the cost of complying with the covenants and restrictions under the amended and restated loan agreement  the scope and timing of our picoplatin clinical program and commercialization efforts  including the progress and costs of our ongoing phase iii trial of picoplatin in small cell lung cancer  our ongoing phase ii trials in colorectal and prostate cancers  as well as our ongoing phase i trial of picoplatin oral formulation in solid tumors  our ability to obtain clinical supplies of picoplatin active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  and finished drug product in a timely and cost effective manner  actions taken by the fda and other regulatory authorities  the timing and amount of any milestone or other payments we might receive from or be obligated to pay to potential strategic partners  our degree of success in commercializing picoplatin  the emergence of competing technologies and products  and other adverse market developments  the acquisition or in licensing of other products or intellectual property  the costs of any research collaborations or strategic partnerships established  and the costs of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  during  we experienced significant changes to our capital structure which resulted in an ownership change  as defined under section of the irc 
consequently  the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and research and experimentation credit carryforwards available to be used in future years are limited under irc sections and this limitation resulted in the loss of approximately million of our net operating loss carryforwards and million of our research and development credit carryforwards 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal taxes net of the impact of the above referenced change in ownership under irc section and approximately million for state taxes  which expire from through and from through  respectively 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
at december   we had the following contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations long term debt obligations note payable operating lease obligations seattle premises south san francisco premises capital lease obligations equipment capital lease total lease executed in july see discussion above for details
