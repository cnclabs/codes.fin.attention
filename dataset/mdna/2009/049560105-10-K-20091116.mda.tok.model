item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction this section provides management s discussion of the financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations of atmos energy corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
it includes management s interpretation of our financial results  the factors affecting these results  the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance  some of which are described in item a above  risk factors 
they should be considered in connection with evaluating forward looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward looking statements 
cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements contained in this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forward looking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of when used in this report  or any other of our documents or oral presentations  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  forecast  goal  intend  objective  plan  projection  seek  strategy or similar words are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy  operations  markets  services  rates  recovery of costs  availability of gas supply and other factors 
these risks and uncertainties include the following our ability to continue to access the credit markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements  the impact of recent economic conditions on our customers  increased costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements  market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including market liquidity  commodity price volatility  increasing interest rates and counterparty creditworthiness  regulatory trends and decisions  including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions  increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties  the impact of environmental regulations on our business  the possible impact of future additional regulatory and financial risks associated with global warming and climate change  the concentration of our distribution  pipeline and storage operations in texas  adverse weather conditions  the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and price of natural gas  the capital intensive nature of our gas distribution business  increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy  the inherent hazards and risks involved in operating our gas distribution business  natural disasters  terrorist activities or other events  and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein  especially those discussed in item a above  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  while we believe these forward looking statements to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized 
further  we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward looking statements whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate 
table of contents our estimates  including those related to risk management and trading activities  fair value measurements  allowance for doubtful accounts  legal and environmental accruals  insurance accruals  pension and postretirement obligations  deferred income taxes and valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets 
our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the audit committee quarterly 
actual results may differ from estimates 
regulation our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates  service  maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate 
we meet the criteria established within accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of a cost based  rate regulated entity  which requires us to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in our financial statements in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting standards 
we apply the provisions of this standard to our regulated operations and record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable and regulatory liabilities when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process 
as a result  certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered through rates 
discontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet  which could reduce our net income 
further  regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized 
the amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations 
the impact of regulation on our regulated operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations 
revenue recognition sales of natural gas to our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly basis  however  the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes 
we follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers  but not yet billed under the cycle billing method  are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense 
on occasion  we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities  which are subject to refund 
we recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented 
rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms 
purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility company s non gas costs 
these mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of cost  such as purchased gas costs  that i is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility company s other costs  ii represents a large component of the utility company s cost of service and iii is generally outside the control of the gas utility company 
there is no gross profit generated through purchased gas cost adjustments  but they provide a dollar for dollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs 
although substantially all natural gas distribution sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase  our gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas as a result of the purchased gas cost adjustment mechanism 
the effects of these purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet 
operating revenues for our regulated transmission and storage and pipeline  storage and other segments are recognized in the period in which actual volumes are transported and storage services are provided 
operating revenues for our natural gas marketing segment and the associated carrying value of natural gas inventory inclusive of storage costs are recognized when we sell the gas and physically deliver it to our customers 
operating revenues include realized gains and losses arising from the settlement of financial 
table of contents instruments used in our natural gas marketing activities and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of natural gas inventory designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge and the associated financial instruments 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable arise from natural gas sales to residential  commercial  industrial  municipal and other customers 
for the majority of our receivables  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collections experience 
on certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific customer s inability or reluctance to pay  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect 
however  if circumstances change  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be affected 
circumstances which could affect our estimates include  but are not limited to  customer credit issues  the level of natural gas prices  customer deposits and general economic conditions 
accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible 
financial instruments and hedging activities we currently use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk 
additionally  we periodically use financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
the objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have been tailored to meet the needs of our regulated and nonregulated businesses 
we record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with changes in fair value ultimately recorded in the income statement 
the timing of when changes in fair value of our financial instruments are recorded in the income statement depends on whether the financial instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a different accounting treatment 
changes in fair value for financial instruments that do not meet one of these criteria are recognized in the income statement as they occur 
financial instruments associated with commodity price risk in our natural gas distribution segment  our customers are exposed to the effect of volatile natural gas prices 
we manage this exposure through a combination of physical storage  fixed price forward contracts and financial instruments  primarily over the counter swap and option contracts  in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season 
the costs associated with and the gains and losses arising from the use of financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk in this segment are included in our purchased gas adjustment mechanisms in accordance with regulatory requirements 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are initially recorded as a component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and recognized in revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  there is no earnings impact to our natural gas distribution segment as a result of the use of financial instruments 
our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas supply  arranges transportation and or storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices 
we also perform asset optimization activities in both our natural gas marketing segment and pipeline  storage and other segment 
as a result of these activities  our nonregulated operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas 
we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments  including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
in our natural gas marketing and pipeline  storage and other segments  we have designated the natural gas inventory held by these operating segments as the hedged item in a fair value hedge 
this inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the gas daily index  with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change 
the financial instruments associated with this natural gas inventory have been designated as fair value hedges and are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change 
changes in the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial instruments designated against our physical inventory nymex and the market spot prices used to value 
table of contents our physical storage gas daily result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled 
the difference in the spot price used to value our physical inventory and the forward price used to value the related financial instruments can result in volatility in our reported income as a component of unrealized margins 
we have elected to exclude this spot forward differential for purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fair value hedges 
once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled  the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized 
over time  we expect gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be offset by gains and losses on the fair value hedges  resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction 
we have elected to treat fixed price forward contracts used in our natural gas marketing segment to deliver gas as normal purchases and normal sales 
as such  these deliveries are recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
financial instruments used to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at indexed prices 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses on open financial instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold 
hedge ineffectiveness  to the extent incurred  is reported as a component of revenue 
we also use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities in our natural gas marketing segment that arise after the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory  basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various over the counter and exchange traded options 
these financial instruments have not been designated as hedges 
financial instruments associated with interest rate risk we periodically manage interest rate risk  typically when we issue new or refinance existing long term debt 
as of september   we had no financial instruments in place to manage interest rate risk 
however  in prior years  we entered into treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings 
we designated these treasury lock agreements as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated transaction at the time the agreements were executed 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses associated with the treasury lock agreements were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the realized gain or loss recognized upon settlement of each treasury lock agreement was initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangement 
impairment assessments we perform impairment assessments of our goodwill  intangible assets subject to amortization and long lived assets 
as of september   we had no indefinite lived intangible assets 
we annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise 
we use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
we have determined our reporting units to be each of our natural gas distribution divisions and wholly owned subsidiaries and goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill 
the discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows  future growth rates and the discount rate 
an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value 
we annually assess whether the cost of our intangible assets subject to amortization or other long lived assets is recoverable or that the remaining useful lives may warrant revision 
we perform this assessment more frequently when specific events or circumstances have occurred that suggest the recoverability of the cost of the intangible and other long lived assets is at risk 
when such events or circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows from the 
table of contents operating division or subsidiary to which these assets relate 
these cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made 
changes in these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge 
an impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset 
pension and other postretirement plans pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data 
prior to fiscal  we reviewed the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities annually based upon a june measurement date 
effective october   we changed our measurement date to september the assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities 
the assumed discount rate  the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net pension and postretirement costs 
when establishing our discount rate  we consider high quality corporate bond rates  changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate bond spot rate curve 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan costs 
we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns  equity risk premiums  asset allocations  the effects of active plan management  the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance 
we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not affected 
rather  this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve years 
we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience  the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions 
our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized 
a percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately million 
a percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately million 
fair value measurements we report certain assets and liabilities at fair value  which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 
we primarily use quoted market prices and other observable market pricing information in valuing our financial assets and liabilities and minimize the use of unobservable pricing inputs in our measurements 
prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet at fair value 
within our nonregulated operations  we utilize a mid market pricing convention the mid point between the bid and ask prices as a practical expedient for determining fair value measurement  as permitted under current accounting standards 
values derived from these sources reflect the market in which transactions involving these financial instruments are executed 
we 
table of contents utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair value when external sources are not available 
values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions 
we believe the market prices and models used to value these assets and liabilities represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over the counter quotations  time value and volatility factors underlying the assets and liabilities 
fair value estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved 
our counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies 
this concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market  economic or regulatory conditions 
recent adverse developments in the global financial and credit markets have made it more difficult and more expensive for companies to access the short term capital markets  which may negatively impact the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
a continued tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform 
we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral requirements under certain circumstances 
amounts reported at fair value are subject to potentially significant volatility based upon changes in market prices  the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts  maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions  each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our financial instruments 
we believe the market prices and models used to value these financial instruments represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over the counter quotations  time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts 
values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions 
results of operations overview atmos energy corporation is involved in the distribution  marketing and transportation of natural gas 
accordingly  our results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural gas  particularly during the winter heating season  and the volatility of the natural gas markets 
this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each fiscal year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each fiscal year 
as a result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry  our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years 
additionally  the seasonality of our business impacts our working capital differently at various times during the year 
typically  our accounts receivable  accounts payable and short term debt balances peak by the end of january and then start to decline  as customers begin to pay their winter heating bills 
gas stored underground  particularly in our natural gas distribution segment  typically peaks in november and declines as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers 
during the current year  several external factors have impacted atmos energy  including  but not limited to  adverse developments in the global and financial credit markets and the unfavorable impact of the economic recession 
the tightening of the credit markets has made it more difficult and more expensive for us to access the capital markets 
however  during the fiscal year  we took several steps to improve our financial position 
in march  we successfully completed an offering of million senior notes  and used most of the proceeds in april to redeem million of senior notes that were scheduled to mature in october additionally  we enhanced our liquidity sources in various ways 
in october  we replaced our former million day committed credit facility with a new day million committed credit facility 
then  in october  we replaced the million day committed credit facility with a new day million committed credit facility 
we also converted aem s former million uncommitted credit 
table of contents facility to a day million committed credit facility in december this facility was subsequently increased to million in april finally  in april we replaced an expiring million unsecured committed credit facility with a million unsecured committed credit facility 
after entering into these new facilities  we currently have a total of approximately million available to us under four committed credit facilities 
as a result of these developments and our continued successful financial performance  standard poor s corporation s p upgraded our credit rating from bbb to bbb in december and moody s investors service moody s upgraded the credit rating on our senior long term debt from baa to baa and our commercial paper from p to p in may these ratings upgrades have improved our ability to access the short term capital markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements on more economical terms 
however  the turmoil in the financial markets did also have a direct financial impact on our results of operations 
we determined that the decline in fair value for certain available for sale securities in our supplemental executive benefit plans experienced during the year ended september  was other than temporary and  accordingly  recorded a million noncash charge to impair the assets 
as a result of these impairments  we do not maintain any investments that are in an unrealized loss position 
finally  challenging economic times resulted in a general decline in throughput across most of our business segments 
the impact of the economic downturn is most apparent in a general decline in throughput 
our natural gas distribution segment has experienced a year over year percent decrease in consolidated throughput  primarily associated with lower residential  commercial and industrial consumption 
declines in the demand for natural gas as a result of idle production and plant closures have contributed to an percent year over year decrease in consolidated throughput in our regulated transmission and storage segment and a percent year over year decrease in consolidated sales volumes in our natural gas marketing segment 
however  recent improvements in rate design in our natural gas distribution segment and the ability to earn higher per unit margins in our regulated transmission and storage and natural gas marketing segments has more than offset the decline in throughput and sales volumes 
additionally  reduced demand for natural gas has resulted in lower natural gas prices  which has contributed significantly to the increase in our operating cash flow 
consolidated results the following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended september   and for the fiscal year ended september in thousands  except per share data operating revenues gross profit operating expenses operating income miscellaneous income expense interest charges income before income taxes income tax expense net income earnings per diluted share historically  our regulated operations arising from our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations contributed to percent of our consolidated net income 
regulated operations contributed percent  percent and percent to our consolidated net income for fiscal years   
table of contents and our consolidated net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across our business segments as follows for the fiscal year ended september in thousands natural gas distribution segment regulated transmission and storage segment natural gas marketing segment pipeline  storage and other segment net income the following table segregates our consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share between our regulated and nonregulated operations for the fiscal year ended september in thousands  except per share data regulated operations nonregulated operations consolidated net income diluted eps from regulated operations diluted eps from nonregulated operations consolidated diluted eps net income during fiscal increased six percent over fiscal net income from our regulated operations increased percent during fiscal the increase primarily reflects a million increase in gross profit resulting from the net favorable impact of various ratemaking activities in our natural gas distribution segment  partially offset by higher depreciation expense  pipeline maintenance costs and interest expense 
net income in our nonregulated operations decreased million  primarily due to the impact of unrealized margins 
unrealized margins totaled million which reduced earnings per share by per diluted share 
the overall increase in consolidated net income was also favorably affected by non recurring items totaling million  or per diluted share  related to the following pre tax amounts million related to a favorable one time tax benefit million related to the favorable impact of an update to the estimate for unbilled accounts million favorable impact of the reversal of estimated uncollectible gas costs million unfavorable impact of a non cash impairment charge of million related to available for sale securities in our supplemental executive retirement plan net income during fiscal increased seven percent over fiscal net income from our regulated operations increased percent during fiscal the increase primarily reflects a million increase in gross profit resulting from our ratemaking efforts  coupled with higher per unit transportation margins and an percent increase in consolidated throughput in our atmos pipeline texas division 
these increases were partially offset by a four percent increase in operating expenses 
net income in our nonregulated operations experienced a percent decline as less volatile natural gas market conditions significantly reduced our asset optimization margins 
however  higher delivered gas margins in our natural gas marketing segment and unrealized margins partially offset this decrease 
see the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments 

table of contents natural gas distribution segment the primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return  the cost of natural gas  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 
our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and  ultimately  separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns 
improving rate design is a long term process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions 
the ratemaking activity section of this form k describes our current rate strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 
our natural gas distribution operations are also affected by the cost of natural gas 
the cost of gas is passed through to our customers without markup 
therefore  increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues 
accordingly  we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues 
however  gross profit in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes  which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs 
therefore  the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes 
we record the tax expense as a component of taxes  other than income 
although changes in revenue related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit  over time the impact is offset within operating income 
prior to january   timing differences existed between the recognition of revenue for franchise fees collected from our customers and the recognition of expense of franchise taxes 
these timing differences had a significant temporary effect on operating income in periods with volatile gas prices  particularly in our mid tex division 
beginning january   changes in our franchise fee agreements in our mid tex division became effective which should significantly reduce the impact of this timing difference on a prospective basis 
although this timing difference will still be present for gross receipts taxes  the timing differences described above should be less significant 
higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections  resulting in higher bad debt expense  and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 
finally  higher gas costs  as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources

table of contents fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  the million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects an increase in rates 
the major components of the increase are as follows million net increase in rates in the mid tex division as a result of the implementation of its rate review mechanism rrm filing with all incorporated cities in the division other than the city of dallas and environs the settled cities and adjustments for customers in the city of dallas 
million increase in other rate adjustments primarily in georgia  kansas  louisiana and west texas 
million increase attributable to a non recurring update to our estimate for gas delivered to customers but not yet billed to reflect changes in base rates in several of our jurisdictions recorded in the fiscal first quarter 
million uncollectible gas cost accrual recorded in a prior year that was reversed in the current year period 
these increases were partially offset by million decrease as a result of a five percent decrease in consolidated distribution throughput primarily associated with lower residential  commercial and industrial consumption and warmer weather in our colorado service area  which does not have weather normalized rates 
million decrease due to lower revenue related taxes  partially offset by the associated franchise and state gross receipts tax expense recorded as a component of taxes other than income discussed below 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense  taxes  other than income and asset impairments decreased million  primarily due to the following million decrease due to lower legal  fuel and other administrative costs 
million decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts due to the impact of recent rate design changes in certain jurisdictions that allow us to recover the gas cost portion of uncollectible accounts as well as a percent year over year decline in the average cost of gas 
million decrease in taxes other than income primarily associated with lower franchise fees and state gross receipt taxes 
these decreases were partially offset by million increase in depreciation and amortization  due primarily to additional assets placed in service during the current year 
million increase due to a noncash charge to impair certain available for sale investments as we believed the fair value of these investments would not recover within a reasonable period of time 
results for the current year include a million tax benefit associated with updating the rates used to determine our deferred taxes 
in addition  results for the prior year included a million gain on the sale of irrigation assets in our west texas division 
interest charges increased million primarily due to the effect of the company s march issuance of million senior notes to repay million senior notes in april in addition  we experienced higher average short term debt balances  interest rates and commitment fees during the current year compared to the prior year 

table of contents fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  the million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit is primarily the result of increased rates and higher revenue related taxes 
the major components of the increase are as follows million increase in rates in the mid tex division due to its grip filing  the fiscal and rate cases and the absence of a one time grip refund that occurred in fiscal million increase in rates in the kansas  kentucky  louisiana  tennessee and west texas divisions 
million increase due to higher revenue related taxes  partially offset by the associated franchise and state gross receipts tax expense recorded as a component of taxes other than income discussed below 
million increase due to an accrual for estimated unrecoverable gas costs in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes  other than income  increased by a net million  primarily due to the following million increase primarily due to higher employee and administrative costs and increased natural gas odorization and fuel costs 
increase in franchise and state gross receipts taxes due to higher revenues 
million increase due to the absence in the current year of the deferral of hurricane related operation and maintenance expenses in fiscal million noncash charge associated with the write off of software costs in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal these increases were offset by a million decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts  which reflects our continued effective collection efforts 
the increase in miscellaneous income primarily reflects the recognition of a million gain on the sale of irrigation assets in our west texas division during the fiscal second quarter 
interest charges allocated to the natural gas distribution segment decreased million due to lower average outstanding short term debt balances in fiscal compared with fiscal regulated transmission and storage segment our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline texas division 
the atmos pipeline texas division transports natural gas to our mid tex division and third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas 
we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements  lending and sales of inventory on hand 
similar to our natural gas distribution segment  our regulated transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 
natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas 
however  natural gas prices could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve  which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline 
additionally  pricing differences that occur between the natural gas hubs served by our pipeline could significantly impact our results as we can profit through the arbitrage of these spreads 
spread differences are influenced by supply and demand constraints not only in the markets we directly serve but in other markets as well 
further  as the atmos pipeline texas division operations supply all of the natural gas for our mid tex division  the results of this segment are highly dependent upon the natural gas requirements of the mid tex division 
finally  as a regulated pipeline  the operations of the atmos pipeline texas division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs

these increases were partially offset by an million decrease associated with a decrease in transportation volumes to our mid tex division due to warmer weather and a decrease in electrical generation  barnett shale and hub deliveries 
operating expenses increased million primarily due to higher levels of pipeline maintenance activities 
results for the current year period also include a million tax benefit associated with updating the rates used to determine our deferred taxes 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  the million increase in regulated transmission and storage gross profit is primarily the result of rate adjustments and increased volumes 
the major components of the increase are as follows million increase from rate adjustments resulting from our and grip filings 
million increase from transportation volumes as consolidated throughput increased percent primarily due to increased transportation in the barnett shale region of texas 

table of contents million increase related to increased service fees and per unit transportation margins due to favorable market conditions 
million increase due to new compression contracts and transportation capacity enhancements 
million increase in sales of excess gas compared to operating expenses increased million primarily due to increased pipeline integrity and maintenance costs 
natural gas marketing segment aem s primary business is to aggregate and purchase gas supply  arrange transportation and storage logistics and ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices 
in addition  aem utilizes proprietary and customer owned transportation and storage assets to provide various services our customers request  including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and market based prices  contract negotiation and administration  load forecasting  gas storage acquisition and management services  transportation services  peaking sales and balancing services  capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of financial instruments 
as a result  aem s margins arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and our ability to identify the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies  transportation and markets to which it has access to serve those customers 
aem seeks to enhance its gross profit margin by maximizing  through asset optimization activities  the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity we own or control in our natural gas distribution and natural gas marketing segments 
we attempt to meet this objective by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 
this process involves purchasing physical natural gas  storing it in the storage and transportation assets to which aem has access and selling financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit margin 
aem continually manages its net physical position to attempt to increase the future economic profit that was created when the original transaction was executed 
therefore  aem may subsequently change its originally scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions and recognize any associated gains or losses at that time 
if aem elects to accelerate the withdrawal of physical gas  it will execute new financial instruments to hedge the original financial instruments 
if aem elects to defer the withdrawal of gas  it will reset its financial instruments by settling the original financial instruments and executing new financial instruments to correspond to the revised withdrawal schedule 
we use financial instruments  designated as fair value hedges  to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our natural gas marketing storage activities 
these financial instruments are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change 
the hedged natural gas inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the gas daily index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change 
changes in the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against our physical inventory and the market spot prices used to value our physical storage result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled 
once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled  the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized 
aem also uses financial instruments to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that may arise after the original physical inventory hedge and to attempt to insulate and protect the economic value within its asset optimization activities 
changes in fair value associated with these financial instruments are recognized as a component of unrealized margins until they are settled 
due to the nature of these operations  natural gas prices have a significant impact on our natural gas marketing operations 
within our delivered gas activities  higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our 
table of contents accounts receivable collections  resulting in higher bad debt expense  and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 
higher gas prices  as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may also cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources 
within our asset optimization activities  higher gas prices could also lead to increased borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 
volatility in natural gas prices also has a significant impact on our natural gas marketing segment 
increased price volatility often has a significant impact on the spreads between the market spot prices and forward natural gas prices  which creates opportunities to earn higher arbitrage spreads within our asset optimization activities 
however  increased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized margins recorded in our gross profit and could impact the amount of cash required to collateralize our risk management liabilities 
review of financial and operating results financial and operational highlights for our natural gas marketing segment for the fiscal years ended september   and are presented below 
gross profit margin consists primarily of margins earned from the delivery of gas and related services requested by our customers and margins earned from asset optimization activities  which are derived from the utilization of our proprietary and managed third party storage and transportation assets to capture favorable arbitrage spreads through natural gas trading activities 
unrealized margins represent the unrealized gains or losses on our net physical position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk as described above 
these margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices 
generally  if the physical financial spread narrows  we will record unrealized gains or lower unrealized losses 
if the physical financial spread widens  we will record unrealized losses or lower unrealized gains 
the magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also dependent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period

table of contents fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  aem s delivered gas business contributed percent to total realized margins during fiscal with asset optimization activities contributing the remaining percent 
in the prior year  delivered gas activities represented substantially all of aem s realized gross profit margin 
the million increase in realized gross profit reflected a million increase in asset optimization margins 
aem realized substantially all of its realized asset optimization margin in the fiscal first quarter when it realized substantially all of the economic value that it had captured as of september  from withdrawing gas and settling the associated financial instruments 
since that time  as a result of falling current cash prices  aem has been deferring storage withdrawals and has been a net injector of gas into storage to increase the economic value it could realize in future periods from its asset optimization activities 
in the prior year  aem deferred storage withdrawals primarily into fiscal and recognized losses on the settlement of the associated financial instruments 
a million increase in realized delivered gas margins 
aem experienced a six percent increase in per unit margins as a result of improved basis spreads in certain market areas where we were able to better optimize transportation assets and successful contract renewals 
these margin improvements more than offset a four percent decrease in gross sales volumes primarily attributable to lower industrial demand as a result of the current economic climate 
the increase in realized gross profit was more than offset by a million decrease in unrealized margins attributable to the following the realization of unrealized gains recorded during fiscal a modest widening of the physical financial spreads  partially offset by favorable unrealized basis gains in certain markets 
a bcf increase in aem s net physical position 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense  taxes  other than income taxes  and asset impairments  increased million primarily due the following factors million increase in legal and other administrative costs 
million decrease related to tax matters incurred in the prior year that did not recur in the current year 
asset optimization activities aem monitors the impact of its asset optimization efforts by estimating the gross profit  before related fees  that it captured through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas and the execution of the associated financial instruments 
this economic value  combined with the effect of the future reversal of unrealized gains or losses currently recognized in the income statement and related fees is referred to as the potential gross profit 
we define potential gross profit as the change in aem s gross profit in future periods if its optimization efforts are executed as planned 
this amount does not include other operating expenses and associated income taxes that will be incurred to realize this amount 
therefore  it does not represent an estimated increase in future net income 
there is no assurance that the economic value or the potential gross profit will be fully realized in the future 
we consider this measure a non gaap financial measure as it is calculated using both forward looking storage injection withdrawal and hedge settlement estimates and historical financial information 
this measure is presented because we believe it provides a more comprehensive view to investors of our asset optimization efforts and thus a better understanding of these activities than would be presented by gaap measures alone 

table of contents the following table presents aem s economic value and its potential gross profit loss at september  and september in millions  unless otherwise noted economic value associated unrealized gains losses subtotal related fees potential gross profit loss net physical position bcf related fees represent aem s contractual costs to acquire the storage capacity utilized in its asset optimization operations 
the fees primarily consist of demand fees and contractual obligations to sell gas below market index prices in exchange for the right to manage and optimize third party storage assets for the positions aem has entered into as of september  and during the year ended september   aem s economic value decreased from million  or mcf at september   to million  or mcf 
as discussed above  in the fiscal first quarter  aem withdrew gas and realized substantially all of the economic value that it captured as of september  during the remainder of the year  as a result of falling current cash prices  aem deferred certain storage withdrawals and has been a net injector of gas into storage to increase economic value that it can realize in future periods 
the economic value is based upon planned storage injection and withdrawal schedules and its realization is contingent upon the execution of this plan  weather and other execution factors 
since aem actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to attempt to enhance the future profitability of its storage position  it may change its scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions 
therefore  we cannot ensure that the economic value or the potential gross profit calculated as of september  will be fully realized in the future nor can we ensure in what time periods such realization may occur 
further  if we experience operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions  our earnings could be adversely impacted 
assuming aem fully executes its plan in place on september   without encountering operational or other issues  we anticipate the majority of the potential gross profit as of september  will be recognized during the first and second quarters of fiscal fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  aem s delivered gas business represented substantially all of aem s realized gross profit margin in fiscal in fiscal  aem s delivered gas business contributed percent to total realized margins during the year with asset optimization activities contributing the remaining percent 
the million decrease in realized gross profit reflected a million decrease in realized asset optimization margins 
as a result of less volatile natural gas market conditions experienced during fiscal  aem regularly deferred storage withdrawals and reset the associated financial instruments to increase the future economic value it could realize in future periods from its asset optimization activities 
aem recognized losses on the settlement of the associated financial instruments without corresponding storage withdrawal gains 
in fiscal  aem changed its withdrawal schedule within the fiscal year and recognized substantially smaller losses from resetting its position 
increased storage fees during fiscal also contributed to the decrease 
a million increase in realized delivered gas margins 
gross sales volumes increased eight percent due to the successful execution of our marketing strategies 
basis gains and contract renewals increased 
table of contents per unit margins percent 
excluding the impact of basis gains  per unit margins increased seven percent in fiscal the decrease in realized gross profit was partially offset by a million increase in unrealized margins attributable to a narrowing of the spreads between current cash prices and forward natural gas prices 
this impact was partially mitigated by a bcf decrease in the net physical position 
the realization of unrealized gains recorded during fiscal operating expenses increased million primarily due to the following million increase in other administrative costs 
million increase associated with property taxes 
pipeline  storage and other segment our pipeline  storage and other segment consists primarily of the operations of atmos pipeline and storage  llc aps 
aps is engaged in nonregulated transmission  storage and natural gas gathering services 
its primary asset is a proprietary mile pipeline located in new orleans  louisiana that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in louisiana and for our natural gas marketing segment  and  on a more limited basis  to third parties 
aps also owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in kentucky and louisiana that are used to reduce the need of our natural gas distribution divisions to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods 
aps also engages in asset optimization activities whereby it seeks to maximize the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls 
certain of these arrangements are with regulated affiliates of the company which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions 
generally  these asset management plans require aps to share with our regulated customers a portion of the profits earned from these arrangements 
aps also seeks to maximize the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from the pricing differences that occur over time 
results for this segment are primarily impacted by seasonal weather patterns and  similar to our natural gas marketing segment  volatility in the natural gas markets 
additionally  this segment s results include an unrealized component as aps hedges its risk associated with its asset optimization activities

liquidity and capital resources the liquidity required to fund our working capital  capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of sources including internally generated funds and borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities 
additionally  we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis without using our credit facilities 
finally  from time to time  we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs 

table of contents the primary means we use to fund our working capital needs and growth is to utilize internally generated funds and to access the commercial paper markets 
adverse developments in global financial and credit markets during the first fiscal quarter of made it more difficult and more expensive for the company to access the short term capital markets  including the commercial paper market  to satisfy our liquidity requirements 
consequently  during the first quarter  we experienced higher than normal borrowings under our five year credit facility used to backstop our commercial paper program in lieu of commercial paper borrowings to fund our working capital needs 
however  subsequent to the end of the first quarter  credit market conditions improved  both as to availability and interest rates  and we have been able to access the commercial paper markets on more reasonably economical terms 
further  as a result of our financing activities described below  we received credit rating upgrades from two of the three credit rating agencies  which has reduced the cost of our commercial paper borrowings 
at september   we had commercial paper outstanding of million under this facility and million was available 
on march   we closed our offering of million of senior notes due most of the net proceeds of approximately million were used to redeem our million unsecured senior notes on april   prior to their october maturity 
in connection with the repayment of the million unsecured senior notes  we paid a million call premium in accordance with the terms of the senior notes and accrued interest of approximately million 
the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
in october  we replaced our former million day committed credit facility that was entered into in october with a new day credit facility on similar terms that will allow borrowings up to million and expires in october in december  we converted aem s former million uncommitted credit facility to a million committed credit facility that will expire in december effective april   we exercised the accordion feature of this facility to increase the credit available under the facility to million 
we are currently negotiating to renew this facility 
in addition  we replaced our million unsecured committed credit facility that expired in march with a million unsecured facility effective april  as a result of executing these new agreements  we have a total of approximately billion available to us under four committed credit facilities 
as of september   the amount available to us under our credit facilities  net of outstanding letters of credit  was approximately million 
we believe the liquidity provided by our committed credit facilities  combined with our operating cash flows  will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs  capital expenditures and other expenditures for fiscal year cash flows our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors  some of which we cannot control 
these include regulatory changes  the price for our services  the demand for such products and services  margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices  operational risks and other factors

in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities change in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents cash flows from operating activities year over year changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income  working capital changes  particularly within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections  payments for natural gas purchases and purchased gas cost recoveries 
the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  operating cash flows were million higher in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the following million increase attributable to the favorable impact on our working capital due to the decline in natural gas prices in the current year compared to the prior year 
million increase due to lower cash margin requirements related to our natural gas marketing financial instruments 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease due to a contribution made to our pension plans in the current year 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  operating cash flows were million lower in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the following million decrease due to higher cash margin requirements related to our natural gas marketing financial instruments 
million decrease due to the unfavorable timing of gas cost collections in our natural gas distribution segment 
cash flows from investing activities in recent fiscal years  a substantial portion of our cash resources has been used to fund acquisitions and growth projects  our ongoing construction program and improvements to information technology systems 
our ongoing construction program enables us to provide natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base  expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets  enhance the integrity of our pipelines and  more recently  expand our intrastate pipeline network 
in executing our current rate strategy  we are focusing our capital spending in jurisdictions that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system 
currently  our mid tex  louisiana  mississippi and west texas natural gas distribution divisions and our atmos pipeline texas division have rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case 
for the fiscal year ended september   we incurred million for capital expenditures compared with million for the fiscal year ended september  and million for the fiscal year ended september  the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects million related to spending for a regulated transmission pipeline project completed in the fourth quarter of the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects the following million increase in compliance spending and main replacements in our mid tex division 
million increase in the natural gas distribution segment for our new automated meter reading initiative 
million increase related to spending for two nonregulated growth projects

these facilities included a five year million unsecured facility expiring december  a million unsecured facility expiring october  and a million unsecured facility expiring march  at the time the million credit facility was established  borrowings under the facility were limited to million 
however  in march  the facility was amended to reduce the amount available to million to reflect the bankruptcy of one lender that participated in the facility 
in october  we replaced our million facility at its termination with a new million unsecured day facility 
after giving effect to these changes  the amount available to us under our committed credit facilities was million 
as of september   we had no outstanding letters of credit under these facilities 
aem has a committed credit facility that can provide up to million to support its nonregulated activities  primarily the issuance of letters of credit to natural gas suppliers 
as of september   the amount available to us under this credit facility  net of outstanding letters of credit  was million 
our credit capacity and the amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our short term borrowing requirements  which are typically highest during colder winter months 
our working capital needs can vary significantly due to changes in the price of natural gas charged by suppliers and the increased gas supplies required to meet customers needs during periods of cold weather 
however  we believe these credit facilities  combined with our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs  our fiscal capital expenditure program and our common stock dividends 
these facilities are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements

most of the net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay our million unsecured senior notes on april  as of september   we had million of availability remaining under the registration statement 
however  due to certain restrictions placed by one state regulatory commission on our ability to issue securities under the registration statement  we now have remaining and available for issuance a total of approximately million of equity securities and million of debt securities 

table of contents credit ratings our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short term and long term financing  in addition to the cost of such financing 
in determining our credit ratings  the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors  including debt to total capitalization  operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt  operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status 
in addition  the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time  the quality of our management and business strategy  the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate 
our debt is rated by three rating agencies standard poor s corporation s p  moody s investors services  inc moody s and fitch ratings  ltd 
fitch 
in december  s p upgraded our senior long term debt credit rating from bbb to bbb and changed our rating outlook from positive to stable 
s p cited improved financial performance and rate case decisions that have increased cash flow as the key drivers for the upgrade 
in may  moody s upgraded the credit rating on our senior long term debt from baa to baa and on our commercial paper from p to p moody s stated that the key drivers for the upgrade were the completion of a major debt refinancing and the company improving its alternate liquidity resources while maintaining solid financial performance 
as of september   all three rating agencies maintained a stable outlook 
none of our ratings are currently under review 
our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows s p moody s fitch unsecured senior long term debt bbb baa bbb commercial paper a p f a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of the recent adverse global financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating agencies 
this would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings 
a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
the highest investment grade credit rating for s p is aaa  moody s is aaa and fitch is aaa 
the lowest investment grade credit rating for s p is bbb  moody s is baa and fitch is bbb 
our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies  and each rating should be evaluated independent of any other rating 
there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered  or withdrawn entirely  by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances so warrant

table of contents total debt as a percentage of total capitalization  including short term debt  was percent and percent at september  and the decrease in the debt to capitalization ratio primarily reflects a decrease in short term debt as of september  compared to the prior year 
our ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically greater during the winter heating season as we make additional short term borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements 
we consider our optimal capitalization ratio to be in the range of to percent and seek to maintain this range through cash flow generated from operations  continued issuance of new common stock under our direct stock purchase plan and retirement savings plan and access to the equity capital markets

aem was committed to purchase bcf within one year under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from to per mcf 
with the exception of our mid tex division  our natural gas distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year 
commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices 
commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract 
our mid tex division maintains long term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices 
the estimated commitments under these contract terms as of september  are reflected in the table above 
risk management activities we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and  periodically  to manage interest rate risk 
we conduct risk management activities through our natural gas distribution  natural gas marketing and pipeline  storage and other segments 
in our natural gas distribution segment  we use a combination of physical storage  fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter period gas price increases 
in our natural gas marketing and pipeline  storage and other segments  we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments  including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
to the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges  we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting  resulting in the financial instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings 
we use financial instruments  designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at index prices  to mitigate the commodity price risk in our natural gas marketing segment associated with deliveries under fixed priced forward contracts to deliver gas to customers  and we use financial instruments  designated as fair value hedges  to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our asset optimization activities in our natural gas marketing and pipeline  storage and other segments 
also  in our natural gas marketing segment  we use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory  basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various over the counter and exchange traded options 
these financial instruments have not been designated as hedges 
we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities  which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument

a portion of these costs is capitalized into our gas distribution rate base  and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 
the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal compared with fiscal primarily reflects the change in assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed september  the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan s liabilities generally is based on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid 
at our september  measurement date  the interest rates were approximately basis points higher than the interest rates at june   the measurement date used to determine our fiscal net periodic cost 
the corresponding increase in the discount rate was the primary 
table of contents driver for the increase in our fiscal pension and benefit costs 
our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at percent 
the periodic pension and other benefits costs remained relatively unchanged during fiscal compared with fiscal as the assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed june  were consistent with the prior year 
at our june  measurement date  the interest rates were consistent with rates at our prior year measurement date  which resulted in no change to our percent discount rate used to determine our fiscal net periodic and post retirement cost 
in addition  our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at percent 
pension and postretirement plan funding generally  our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the employee retirement income security act of  including the funding requirements under the pension protection act of ppa 
however  additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary 
contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 
during fiscal  we contributed million in cash to our pension plans to achieve a desired level of funding for the plan year while maximizing the tax deductibility of this payment 
the need for this funding reflected the decline in the fair value of the plans assets resulting from the unfavorable market conditions experienced during the latter half of calendar year this contribution increased the level of our plan assets to achieve a desirable funding threshold as established by the ppa 
during fiscal  we voluntarily contributed million to the atmos energy corporation retirement plan for mississippi valley gas union employees 
this contribution achieved a desired level of funding for this plan for the plan year 
during fiscal  we did not contribute to our pension plans 
we contributed million  million and million to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended september   and the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions 
outlook for fiscal as of september   interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates  which impacted our fiscal net periodic pension and postretirement costs  were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september   the measurement date for our fiscal net periodic cost 
as a result of the lower interest and corporate bond rates  we decreased the discount rate used to determine our fiscal pension and benefit costs to percent 
we maintained the expected return on our pension plan assets at percent  despite the recent decline in the financial markets as we believe this rate reflects the average rate of expected earnings on plan assets that will fund our projected benefit obligation 
although the fair value of our plan assets has declined as the financial markets have declined  the impact of this decline is mitigated by the fact that assets are smoothed for purposes of determining net periodic pension cost which results in asset gains and losses that are recognized over time as a component of net periodic pension and benefit costs for our pension account plan  our largest funded plan 
accordingly  we expect our fiscal pension and postretirement medical costs to be materially the same as in fiscal based upon market conditions subsequent to september   the current funded position of the plans and the new funding requirements under the ppa  we believe it is reasonably possible that we will be required to contribute to the plans in fiscal further  we will consider whether an additional voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain ppa funding thresholds 
however  we cannot anticipate with certainty whether such contributions will be made and the amount of such contributions 
with respect to our postretirement medical plans  we anticipate contributing approximately million during fiscal as of september   the board of directors approved a change to the cost sharing methodology for employees who had not met the participation requirements by that date for the retiree medical plan for retirees and disabled employees of atmos energy corporation the retiree medical plan 
starting in five 
table of contents years  on january   the contribution rates that will apply to all non grandfathered participants will be determined using a new cost sharing methodology by which atmos energy will limit its contribution to a three percent cost increase in claims and administrative costs each year 
if medical costs covered by the retiree medical plan increase more than three percent annually  participants will be responsible for the additional cost 
during the last fiscal year  the company has worked with our independent compensation consultant to develop and implement a new serp design for any new executives or current employees selected for participation in the serp arrangement on a prospective basis 
only those executives who are currently members of our management committee as well as those individuals who may be selected in the future to serve on the management committee  plus those executives who are active serp participants as of august   will continue to participate in the current serp arrangement until their respective retirement dates 
the current serp arrangement is a percent of covered compensation defined benefit arrangement in which benefits from the underlying qualified defined benefit plan are an offset to the serp benefit 
the new serp arrangement for new participants in the company s executive retirement program is a modified defined benefit approach in which the company will contribute to a nominal account for each participant  an amount equal to ten percent of each participant s base salary and bonus following the participant s completion of a plan year of service 
other provisions of the plan mirror that of the company s underlying qualified plan  the pension account plan 
at this time  only one employee has been selected for participation in the new serp arrangement 
the projected pension liability  future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change  depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date 
these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns  changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan 
recent accounting developments recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity 
interest rate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities 
we conduct risk management activities through both our natural gas distribution and natural gas marketing segments 
in our natural gas distribution segment  we use a combination of physical storage  fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases 
in our natural gas marketing segment  we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our issuance of short term commercial paper and our other short term borrowings 
commodity price risk natural gas distribution segment we purchase natural gas for our natural gas distribution operations 
substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for natural gas distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost 
table of contents adjustment mechanisms 
therefore  our natural gas distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 
natural gas marketing and pipeline  storage and other segments our natural gas marketing segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas 
for our natural gas marketing segment  we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate commodity price risk by applying a change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period 
based on aeh s net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at september  of bcf  a change in the forward nymex price would have had a million impact on our consolidated net income 
changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fair value hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income  but  over time  gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fair value hedges 
based upon our net physical position at september  and assuming our hedges would still qualify as highly effective  a change in the difference between the gas daily and nymex indices would impact our reported net income by approximately million 
additionally  these changes could cause us to recognize a risk management liability  which would require us to place cash into an escrow account to collateralize this liability position 
this  in turn  would reduce the amount of cash we would have on hand to fund our working capital needs 
interest rate risk our earnings are exposed to changes in short term interest rates associated with our short term commercial paper program and other short term borrowings 
we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our short term interest rate risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate our short term interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our short term borrowings 
had interest rates associated with our short term borrowings increased by an average of one percent  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million during as of september   we were not engaged in other activities that would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates or market commodity prices
