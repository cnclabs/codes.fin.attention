overview we are an asset management company with equity investments in a diverse group of boutique investment management firms our affiliates 
we pursue a growth strategy designed to generate shareholder value through the internal growth of our existing business  additional investments in boutique investment management firms and strategic transactions and relationships designed to enhance our affiliates businesses and growth prospects 
through our affiliates  we manage approximately billion in assets as of december  in more than investment products across a broad range of asset classes and investment styles in three principal distribution channels mutual fund  institutional and high net worth 
we believe that our diversification across asset classes  investment styles and distribution channels helps to mitigate our exposure to the risks created by changing market environments 
the following summarizes our operations in our three principal distribution channels 
our affiliates provide advisory or sub advisory services to more than mutual funds 
these funds are distributed to retail and institutional clients directly and through intermediaries  including independent investment advisors  retirement plan sponsors  broker dealers  major fund marketplaces and bank trust departments 

table of contents in the institutional distribution channel  our affiliates offer approximately investment products across approximately different investment styles  including small  small mid  mid and large capitalization value  growth equity and emerging markets 
in addition  our affiliates offer quantitative  alternative  credit arbitrage and fixed income products 
through this distribution channel  our affiliates manage assets for foundations and endowments  defined benefit and defined contribution plans for corporations and municipalities  and taft hartley plans  with disciplined and focused investment styles that address the specialized needs of institutional clients 
the high net worth distribution channel is comprised broadly of two principal client groups 
the first group consists principally of direct relationships with high net worth individuals and families and charitable foundations 
for these clients  our affiliates provide investment management or customized investment counseling and fiduciary services 
the second group consists of individual managed account client relationships established through intermediaries  generally brokerage firms or other sponsors 
our affiliates provide investment management services through approximately managed account and wrap programs 
we operate our business through our affiliates in our three principal distribution channels  maintaining each affiliate s distinct entrepreneurial culture and independence through our investment structure 
in making investments in boutique asset management firms  we seek to partner with the highest quality firms in the industry  with outstanding management teams  strong long term performance records and a demonstrated commitment to continued growth and success 
fundamental to our investment approach is the belief that affiliate management equity ownership along with amg s ownership aligns our interests and provides affiliate managers with a powerful incentive to continue to grow their business 
our investment structure provides a degree of liquidity and diversification to principal owners of boutique investment management firms  while at the same time expanding equity ownership opportunities among the firm s management and allowing management to continue to participate in the firm s future growth 
our partnership approach also ensures that affiliates maintain operational autonomy in managing their business  thereby preserving their firm s entrepreneurial culture and independence 
although the specific structure of each investment is highly tailored to meet the needs of a particular affiliate  in all cases  amg establishes a meaningful equity interest in the firm  with the remaining equity interests retained by the management of the affiliate 
each affiliate is organized as a separate firm  and its operating or shareholder agreement is structured to provide appropriate incentives for affiliate management owners and to address the affiliate s particular characteristics while also enabling us to protect our interests  including through arrangements such as long term employment agreements with key members of the firm s management team 
in most cases  we own a majority of the equity interests of a firm and structure a revenue sharing arrangement  in which a percentage of revenue is allocated for use by management of that affiliate in paying operating expenses of the affiliate  including salaries and bonuses 
we call this the operating allocation 
the portion of the affiliate s revenue that is allocated to the owners of that affiliate including us is called the owners allocation 
each affiliate allocates its owners allocation to its managers and to us generally in proportion to their and our respective ownership interests in that affiliate 
one of the purposes of our revenue sharing arrangements is to provide ongoing incentives for affiliate managers by allowing them to participate in the growth of their firm s revenue  which may increase their compensation from both the operating allocation and the owners allocation 
these arrangements also provide incentives to control operating expenses  thereby increasing the portion of the operating allocation that is available for growth initiatives and compensation 
as one measure of 
table of contents these incentives  in  approximately million of compensation and profits were allocated to our affiliate managers reported in compensation expense and minority interest 
an affiliate s operating allocation is structured to cover its operating expenses 
however  should actual operating expenses exceed the operating allocation  our contractual share of cash under the owners allocation generally has priority over the allocations and distributions to the affiliate s managers 
as a result  the excess expenses first reduce the portion of the owners allocation allocated to the affiliate s managers until that portion is eliminated  before reducing the portion allocated to us 
any such reduction in our portion of the owners allocation is required to be paid back to us out of the portion of future owners allocation allocated to the affiliate s managers 
our minority investments are also structured to align our interests with those of the affiliate s management through shared equity ownership  as well as to preserve the affiliate s entrepreneurial culture and independence by maintaining the affiliate s operational autonomy 
in cases where we hold a minority interest  the revenue sharing arrangement generally allocates a percentage of the affiliate s revenue to us 
the remaining revenue is used to pay operating expenses and profit distributions to the other owners 
certain of our affiliates operate under profit based arrangements through which we own a majority of the equity in the firm and receive a share of profits as cash flow  rather than a percentage of revenue through a typical revenue sharing agreement 
as a result  we participate fully in any increase or decrease in the revenue or expenses of such firms 
in these cases  we participate in a budgeting process and generally provide incentives to management through compensation arrangements based on the performance of the affiliate 
we are focused on establishing and maintaining long term partnerships with our affiliates 
our shared equity ownership gives both amg and our affiliate partners meaningful incentives to manage their businesses for strong future growth 
from time to time  we may consider changes to the structure of our relationship with an affiliate in order to better support the firm s growth strategy 
through our affiliated investment management firms  we derive most of our revenue from the provision of investment management services 
investment management fees asset based fees are usually determined as a percentage fee charged on periodic values of a client s assets under management  most asset based advisory fees are billed by our affiliates quarterly 
certain clients are billed for all or a portion of their accounts based upon assets under management valued at the beginning of a billing period in advance 
other clients are billed for all or a portion of their accounts based upon assets under management valued at the end of the billing period in arrears 
most client accounts in the high net worth distribution channel are billed in advance  and most client accounts in the institutional distribution channel are billed in arrears 
clients in the mutual fund distribution channel are billed based upon average daily assets under management 
advisory fees billed in advance will not reflect subsequent changes in the market value of assets under management for that period but may reflect changes due to client withdrawals 
conversely  advisory fees billed in arrears will reflect changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
in addition  over affiliate alternative investment and equity products  representing approximately billion of assets under management as of december   also bill on the basis of absolute or relative investment performance performance fees 
these products  which are primarily in the institutional distribution channel  are often structured to have returns that are not directly correlated to changes in broader equity indices and  if earned  the performance fee component is typically billed less frequently than an asset based fee 
although performance fees inherently depend on investment results and will vary from period to period  we anticipate performance fees to be a recurring component of our revenue 
we also anticipate that  within any calendar year  the majority of performance fees will typically be realized in the fourth quarter 

table of contents for certain of our affiliates  generally where we own a minority interest  we are required to use the equity method of accounting 
consistent with this method  we have not consolidated the operating results of these firms including their revenue in our consolidated statements of income 
our share of these firms profits net of intangible amortization is reported in income from equity method investments  and is therefore reflected in our net income and ebitda 
as a consequence  increases or decreases in these firms assets under management which totaled billion as of december  will not affect reported revenue in the same manner as changes in assets under management at our other affiliates 
our net income reflects the revenue of our consolidated affiliates and our share of income from affiliates which we account for under the equity method  reduced by our expenses  including the operating expenses of our consolidated affiliates  and the profits allocated to managers of our consolidated affiliates ie  minority interest 
as discussed above  for consolidated affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  the operating expenses of the affiliate as well as its managers minority interest generally increase or decrease as the affiliate s revenue increases or decreases because of the direct relationship established in many of our agreements between the affiliate s revenue and its operating allocation and owners allocation 
at our consolidated profit based affiliates  expenses may or may not correspond to increases or decreases in the affiliates revenues 
our level of profitability will depend on a variety of factors  including those affecting the global financial markets generally and the equity markets particularly  which could potentially result in considerable increases or decreases in the assets under management at our affiliates  the level of affiliate revenue  which is dependent on the ability of our existing and future affiliates to maintain or increase assets under management by maintaining their existing investment advisory relationships and fee structures  marketing their services successfully to new clients and obtaining favorable investment results  our receipt of owners allocation from affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  which depends on the ability of our existing and future affiliates to maintain certain levels of operating profit margins  the increases or decreases in the revenue and expenses of affiliates that operate on a profit based model  the availability and cost of the capital with which we finance our existing and new investments  our success in making new investments and the terms upon which such transactions are completed  the level of intangible assets and the associated amortization expense resulting from our investments  the level of our expenses  including compensation for our employees  and the level of taxation to which we are subject

other includes assets under management attributable to affiliate product closings and transfers of our interest in certain affiliated investment management firms 
the operating segment analysis presented in the following table is based on average assets under management 
for the mutual fund distribution channel  average assets under management generally represent an average of the daily net assets under management 
for the institutional and high net worth distribution channels  average assets under management represents an average of the assets at the beginning and end of each calendar quarter during the applicable period 
we believe that this analysis more closely correlates to the billing cycle of each distribution channel and  as such  provides a more meaningful relationship to revenue

note to the consolidated financial statements describes the basis of presentation of the financial results of our three operating segments 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are required to use the equity method of accounting for certain investments and as such do not consolidate their revenue for financial reporting purposes 
our share of profits from these investments is reported in income from equity method investments and is therefore reflected in net income and ebitda 
the definition of ebitda and our reasons for using ebitda are presented in note on page our use of ebitda  including a reconciliation to cash flow from operations  is discussed in greater detail in liquidity and capital resources 
revenue our revenue is generally determined by the level of our assets under management  the portion of our assets across our products and three operating segments  which realize different fee rates  and the recognition of any performance fees 
our revenue decreased million or in from  primarily as a result of a decrease in average assets under management 
the decrease in average assets under management resulted principally from investment performance and negative net client cash flows 

table of contents the increase in revenue of million or in from resulted principally from a increase in average assets under management 
the increase in average assets under management resulted principally from positive investment performance in and  net client cash flows in and  to a lesser extent  our investment in a new affiliate 
the increase in revenue was proportionately less than the growth in assets under management primarily as a result of our equity method investments  as we do not consolidate the revenue or expenses of these affiliates 
the following discusses the changes in our revenue by operating segments 
mutual fund distribution channel the decrease in revenue of million or in the mutual fund distribution channel in from resulted from an decrease in average assets under management

high net worth distribution channel the decrease in revenue of million or in the high net worth distribution channel in from resulted principally from a decrease in average assets under management 
the decrease in average assets under management resulted principally from investment performance  partially offset by our investment in a new affiliate 
the decrease in revenue was proportionately greater than the decrease in assets under management as a result of our equity method investments  as we do not consolidate the revenue or expenses of these affiliates 
our revenue increased million or in from primarily as a result of a increase in average assets under management 
the increase in average assets under management resulted principally from positive investment performance 
the increase in revenue was proportionately less than the increase in assets under management primarily as a result of our equity method investments  as we do not consolidate the revenue or expenses of these affiliates  and increases in assets under management that realize a comparatively lower fee rate 

table of contents operating expenses the following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses in millions change change compensation and related expenses selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets depreciation and other amortization other operating expenses total operating expenses the substantial portion of our operating expenses is incurred by our affiliates  the majority of which is incurred by affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements 
for affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  an affiliate s operating allocation percentage generally determines its operating expenses 
accordingly  our compensation expense is generally impacted by increases or decreases in each affiliate s revenue and the corresponding increases or decreases in their respective operating allocations 
during  approximately million  or about of our consolidated compensation expense  was attributable to our affiliate managers 
the percentage of revenue allocated to operating expenses varies from one affiliate to another and may vary within an affiliate depending on the source or amount of revenue 
as a result  changes in our aggregate revenue may not impact our consolidated operating expenses to the same degree 
compensation and related expenses decreased in and increased in the decrease in was primarily a result of the relationship between revenue and operating expenses at our affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  which experienced aggregate decreases in revenue and accordingly  reported lower compensation expense 
this decrease was also attributable to a million decrease in holding company incentive compensation 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in share based compensation of million  including million related to senior management s surrender of stock options for no consideration accounting standards require that  although no benefits were realized by senior management in connection with the option surrender  the remaining black scholes compensation expense associated with these options must be reported in the period they were forfeited 
the increase in was primarily a result of the relationship between revenue and operating expenses at our affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  which experienced aggregate increases in revenue and accordingly  reported higher compensation expense 
the increase was also related to a million increase in aggregate affiliate expenses from our new investment 
in  the increase in compensation was proportionately greater than the increase in revenue because of an increase in revenue at affiliates with higher operating allocations 
unrelated to the changes in revenue  the increase was also attributable to a million increase in share based compensation 
selling  general and administrative expenses were essentially flat in increases of million attributable to one time affiliate expenses were offset by affiliate cost cutting initiatives and a million decrease in sub advisory and distribution expenses attributable to a decline in assets under management at our affiliates in the mutual fund distribution channel 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in this increase was principally a result of the growth in assets under management at our affiliates in the mutual fund distribution channel 
selling  general and administrative expenses also increased in as a result of million of expenses related to our global distribution initiatives 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in aggregate affiliate expenses from the transfer of our interests in certain affiliates during and 
table of contents amortization of intangible assets increased in and in  principally from an increase in definite lived intangible assets resulting from our investments in new and existing affiliates in recent periods 
depreciation and other amortization increased in and in these increases were principally attributable to spending on depreciable assets in recent periods  as well as our investments in new affiliates 
other operating expenses increased in  principally as a result of a loss realized on the transfer of affiliate interests  partially offset by an increase in income from affiliate investments in marketable securities 
other operating expenses decreased in principally as a result of a gain realized upon the transfer of affiliate interests during as well as a million recovery of affiliate expenses that previously reduced our share of owners allocation 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in aggregate affiliate expenses from our investment in chicago equity partners 
other income statement data the following table summarizes non operating income and expense data in millions change change income loss from equity method investments nm investment and other income investment income loss from affiliate investments in partnerships  nm minority interest in affiliate investments in partnerships  nm minority interest interest expense income tax expense percentage change is not meaningful 
income loss from equity method investments consists of our share of income loss from affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting  net of any related intangible amortization 
income loss from equity method investments decreased substantially in  principally as a result of a million non cash charge to reduce the carrying value of certain affiliates accounted for under the equity method of accounting to their fair value  as well as decreases in assets under management and revenue attributable to affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
income from equity method investments increased in principally as a result of increases in assets under management and revenue attributable to affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting  including investments in new affiliates 
investment and other income increased in  principally from a net gain of million realized on the repurchase of a portion of our junior convertible trust preferred securities and a gain of million realized on the settlement of interest rate derivative contracts 
these gains were partially offset by a decrease in affiliate investment earnings as well as million of expenses incurred from the settlement of our mandatory convertible securities and the conversion of our floating rate senior convertible securities 
investment and other income increased in  principally from an increase in affiliate investment earnings 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  investment income loss from affiliate investments in partnerships and minority interest in affiliate investments in partnerships relate to the consolidation of certain investment partnerships in which our affiliates serve as the general 
table of contents partner 
we are required to consolidate certain affiliate investment partnerships including interests in the partnerships in which we do not have ownership rights in our consolidated financial statements 
for and  the income loss from affiliate investments in partnerships was million and million  respectively  which was principally attributable to investors who are unrelated to us 
minority interest decreased in and increased in these changes were principally as a result of the previously discussed changes in revenue 
in  the decrease in minority interest was proportionately greater than the decrease in revenue as a result of the decrease in affiliate investment income 
interest expense decreased in  principally attributable to a million decrease resulting from the conversion of our floating rate senior convertible securities and the settlement of our mandatory convertible securities and a million decrease in the cost of our senior bank debt resulting from a decline in libor interest rates 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase from the issuance of our junior convertible trust preferred securities in  and a million increase from the issuance of our senior convertible notes 
interest expense increased in  principally from an increase of million related to higher outstanding borrowings under our senior bank debt  million from the october issuance of million of junior convertible trust preferred securities and million from the april issuance of million of junior convertible trust preferred securities 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense from repayment of our senior notes due income taxes decreased in principally as a result of the decrease in net income before taxes of 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in income taxes of million related to the one time revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities as a result of new massachusetts tax legislation 
income taxes increased in principally as a result of the increase in net income before taxes of 
net income the following table summarizes net income for the past three years in millions change change net income net income decreased in  after increasing in the decrease in was principally as a result of the decrease in revenue and the loss from equity method investments  and was partially offset by an increase in investment and other income as well as decreases in reported operating  minority interest and tax expenses  as described above 
the increase in was principally as a result of increases in revenue and income from equity method investments  partially offset by increases in reported operating  interest  minority interest and tax expenses  as described above 
supplemental performance measure as supplemental information  we provide a non gaap performance measure that we refer to as cash net income 
this measure is provided in addition to  but not as a substitute for  net income 
cash net income is defined as net income plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets plus affiliate depreciation 
we consider cash net income an important measure of our financial performance  as we believe it best represents operating performance before non cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our affiliates 
cash net income is used by our management and board of directors as a principal performance benchmark  including as a measure for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value 

table of contents since our acquired assets do not generally depreciate or require replacement by us  and since they generate deferred tax expenses that are unlikely to reverse  we add back these non cash expenses to net income to measure operating performance 
we add back amortization attributable to acquired client relationships because this expense does not correspond to the changes in value of these assets  which do not diminish predictably over time 
the portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets including goodwill that we no longer amortize but which continues to generate tax deductions is added back  because these accruals would be used only in the event of a future sale of an affiliate or an impairment charge  which we consider unlikely 
we add back the portion of consolidated depreciation expense incurred by our affiliates because under our affiliates operating agreements we are generally not required to replenish these depreciating assets 
conversely  we do not add back the deferred taxes relating to our floating rate senior convertible securities or other depreciation expenses 
we intend to modify our definition of cash net income in to add back non cash affiliate equity expense and non cash interest expense related to fasb staff position apb which is effective in 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net income to cash net income in millions net income intangible amortization intangible amortization equity method investment intangible related deferred taxes affiliate depreciation cash net income as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are required to use the equity method of accounting for certain of our investments and  as such  do not separately report these affiliates revenues or expenses including intangible amortization expenses in our income statement 
our share of these investments amortization is reported in income loss from equity method investments 
cash net income decreased in primarily as a result of the decreases in revenue  partially offset by an increase in investment and other income as well as decreases in reported operating  minority interest and tax expenses  as described above 
cash net income increased in  primarily as a result of the previously described factors effect on net income 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity and capital resources december  in millions balance sheet data cash and cash equivalents senior bank debt senior convertible notes zero coupon convertible notes floating rate convertible securities mandatory convertible securities junior convertible trust preferred securities cash flow data operating cash flows investing cash flows financing cash flows ebitda the definition of ebitda is presented in note on page we view our ratio of debt to ebitda our internal leverage ratio as an important gauge of our ability to service debt  make new investments and access additional capital 
consistent with industry practice  we do not consider mandatory convertible securities or junior trust preferred securities as debt for the purpose of determining our internal leverage ratio 
we also view our leverage on a net debt basis by deducting from our debt balance holding company cash including prospective proceeds from the settlement of our forward equity sale agreement 
as of december   our internal leverage ratio was under the terms of our credit facility we are required to meet two financial ratio covenants 
the first of these covenants is a maximum ratio of debt to ebitda the bank leverage ratio of x 
the calculation of our bank leverage ratio is generally consistent with our internal leverage ratio approach 
the second covenant is a minimum ebitda to cash interest expense ratio of x our bank interest coverage ratio 
for the purposes of calculating these ratios  share based compensation expense is added back to ebitda 
as of december   we were in full compliance with the terms of our credit facility 
while continued material declines in the equity markets could negatively impact our ebitda and  in turn  our ability to comply with our covenants  our holding company cash resources are sufficient to repay the balance outstanding under our credit facility 
we are rated bbb by standard poor s 
a downgrade of our credit rating  either as a result of industry or company specific considerations  would not have a material financial effect on any of our agreements or securities or otherwise trigger a default 
in addition to borrowings available under our million revolving credit facility  our current liquidity is augmented by approximately million of holding company cash including prospective proceeds from the forward equity settlement and the free cash flow generated by our business 
we have no near term debt maturities 

table of contents supplemental liquidity measure as supplemental information  we provide information regarding our ebitda  a non gaap liquidity measure 
this measure is provided in addition to  but not as a substitute for  cash flow from operations 
ebitda represents earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda  as calculated by us  may not be consistent with computations of ebitda by other companies 
as a measure of liquidity  we believe that ebitda is useful as an indicator of our ability to service debt  make new investments and meet working capital requirements 
we further believe that many investors use this information when analyzing the financial position of companies in the investment management industry 
the following table provides a reconciliation of cash flow from operations to ebitda in millions cash flow from operations interest expense  net of non cash items current tax provision income from equity method investments  net of distributions changes in assets and liabilities and other adjustments ebitda non cash items represent amortization of issuance costs and interest accretion  and million in  and  respectively

other adjustments include stock option expenses  tax benefits from stock options and other adjustments to reconcile net income to cash flow from operating activities 
the definition of ebitda is presented in note on page in  we met our cash requirements primarily through cash generated by operating activities  borrowings of senior debt and the issuance of convertible securities and common stock 
our principal uses of cash were to settle convertible securities  repurchase shares of our common stock  make investments in new and existing affiliates  repay senior debt and make distributions to affiliate managers 
we expect that our principal uses of cash for the foreseeable future will be for investments in new and existing affiliates  distributions to affiliate managers  payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt  the repurchase of debt securities  the repurchase of shares of our common stock and for working capital purposes

senior bank debt on november   we entered into an amended and restated credit facility the facility 
during the third quarter of  we increased our borrowing capacity to billion  comprised of a million revolving credit facility the revolver and a million term loan the term loan

the holders of the senior convertible notes may require us to repurchase the notes in august of    and we may redeem the notes for cash at any time on or after august  the senior convertible notes are considered contingent payment debt instruments under federal income tax regulations 
these regulations require us to deduct interest in an amount greater than our reported interest expense  which will result in annual deferred tax liabilities of approximately million

the trust s only assets are the junior convertible subordinated debentures 
to the extent that the trust has available funds  we are obligated to ensure that holders of the junior convertible trust preferred securities receive all payments due from the trust 
the and junior convertible trust preferred securities are considered contingent payment debt instruments under the federal income tax regulations 
we are required to deduct interest in an amount greater than our reported interest expense 
in  these deductions will generate deferred taxes of approximately million 
in november  we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of the junior convertible trust preferred securities 
we realized a gain of million on this transaction  which was reported in investment and other income 
following the repurchase  these securities were cancelled and retired 

table of contents purchases of affiliate equity many of our affiliate operating agreements provide our affiliate managers the conditional right to require us to purchase their retained equity interests at certain intervals 
these agreements also provide us a conditional right to require affiliate managers to sell their retained equity interests to us upon their death  permanent incapacity or termination of employment and provide affiliate managers a conditional right to require us to purchase such retained equity interests upon the occurrence of specified events 
these purchases may occur in varying amounts over a period of approximately years or longer  and the actual timing and amounts of such purchases or the actual occurrence of such purchases generally cannot be predicted with any certainty 
these purchases are generally calculated based upon a multiple of the affiliate s cash flow distributions at the time the right is exercised  which is intended to represent fair value 
as one measure of the potential magnitude of such purchases  in the event that a triggering event and resulting purchase occurred with respect to all such retained equity interests as of december   the aggregate amount of these payments would have totaled approximately million 
in the event that all such transactions were consummated  we would own the cash flow distributions attributable to the additional equity interests purchased from our affiliate managers 
as of december   this amount would represent approximately million on an annualized basis 
we may pay for these purchases in cash  shares of our common stock or other forms of consideration 
affiliate management partners are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities in certain cases  subject to our approval or other restrictions 
these potential purchases  combined with our other cash needs  may require more cash than is available from operations  and therefore  we may need to raise capital by making borrowings under our facility  by selling shares of our common stock or other equity or debt securities  or to otherwise refinance a portion of these purchases 
although the timing and amounts of these purchases are difficult to predict  we expect to repurchase approximately million of affiliate equity during and  in such event  will own the cash flow associated with the equity repurchased 
other convertible securities in the first quarter of  we retired two issues of convertible securities  our floating rate senior convertible securities due floating rate convertible securities and mandatory convertible securities prides 
we issued the floating rate convertible securities million in and the prides million in in february  we called the outstanding floating rate convertible securities for redemption at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in lieu of redemption  substantially all of the holders elected to convert their securities 
pursuant to these conversions and other privately negotiated exchanges  we issued approximately million shares of common stock and the floating rate convertible securities were cancelled and retired 
the floating rate convertible securities were considered contingent payment debt instruments under federal income tax regulations that required us to deduct interest in an amount greater than our reported interest expense 
because the trading price of our common stock exceeded at the time of the conversions described above  million of deferred tax liabilities attributable to these securities was reclassified to stockholders equity when the securities were retired 
in march  we repurchased the outstanding senior notes component of the prides 
the repurchase proceeds were used by the original holders to fulfill their obligations under related forward equity purchase contracts 
pursuant to the settlement of the forward equity purchase contracts and other privately negotiated exchanges  we issued approximately million shares of common stock and the prides were cancelled and retired 

table of contents derivatives in  we entered into a series of contracts that provided the option  but not the obligation  to repurchase million shares of our common stock 
upon exercise  we could elect to receive the intrinsic value of a contract in cash or common stock 
during  we exercised our option  which had an intrinsic value of million 
we elected to receive approximately million shares of common stock and used the remaining proceeds  million  to enter into a series of contracts to repurchase up to million shares 
these options expired during the first quarter of during the first quarter of  we entered into a series of treasury rate lock contracts with a notional value of million 
these contracts were settled in the second quarter of  and we received million 
each contract was designated and qualified as a cash flow hedge under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
we documented our hedging strategies and risk management objectives for these contracts 
we assessed and documented  both at inception and on an ongoing basis  whether these hedging contracts were highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedge items 
during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was probable that the hedged transaction would not occur and the gain was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income 
operating cash flow cash flow from operations generally represents net income plus non cash charges for amortization  deferred taxes  equity based compensation and depreciation  as well as increases and decreases in our consolidated working capital 
the decrease in cash flow from operations in as compared to resulted principally from decreased minority interest of million and million from settlements of liabilities  partially offset by million from the collection of accounts receivable 
the increase in cash flow from operations for the year ended as compared to resulted principally from increased net income of million and increased minority interest of million  partially offset by a million increase in settlements of liabilities 
in accordance with eitf  we consolidated and million of client assets held in partnerships controlled by our affiliates as of december  and  respectively 
sales of client assets generated and million of operating cash flow in and  respectively 
investing cash flow changes in net cash flow used in investing activities result primarily from our investments in new and existing affiliates 
net cash flow used to make investments was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these investments were primarily funded with borrowings under our credit facility and existing cash 
in january  we announced an agreement to restructure and postpone our previously announced transaction with harding loevner llc harding loevner 
the amended agreement provides harding loevner the option to complete the transaction during the second half of on terms substantially consistent with the original agreement 
under past acquisition agreements  we are contingently liable  upon achievement of specified financial targets  to make payments of up to million through in  we expect to make total payments of approximately million to settle portions of these contingent obligations  our purchase of affiliate equity as discussed above and our potential investment in harding loevner 

table of contents financing cash flow net cash flows from financing activities decreased million in as compared to  primarily as a result of a net repayment of senior bank debt of combined with settlement of convertible securities  partially offset by a decrease in the repurchases of common stock 
in addition  we issued million of senior convertible notes in and repurchased million aggregate principal amount of our junior convertible trust preferred securities for million 
the increase in cash flows used in financing activities in from was primarily as a result of our million issuance of junior convertible trust preferred securities and a net increase in borrowings under our revolver of million  partially offset by million of repurchases of our common stock 
as more fully discussed in liquidity and capital resources  during  we retired the outstanding floating rate convertible securities and issued approximately million shares of common stock 
additionally  we repurchased the outstanding senior notes component of our prides 
the repurchase proceeds were used by the original holders to fulfill their obligations under the related forward equity purchase contracts 
we issued approximately million shares of common stock to settle the forward equity purchase contracts 
in may  we entered into a forward equity sale agreement under which we may sell up to million of our common stock to a major securities firm  with the timing of sales at our discretion 
through february   we have agreed to sell approximately million under this agreement at a weighted average price of 
we can settle these forward sales at any time prior to december  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r  beginning in  certain tax benefits associated with stock options have been reported as financing cash flows in the amount of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due contractual obligations total thereafter in millions senior bank debt senior convertible securities junior convertible trust preferred securities leases other liabilities total the timing of debt payments assumes that outstanding debt is settled for cash or common stock at the applicable maturity dates 
the amounts include the cash payment of fixed interest 
as more fully discussed on page  consistent with industry practice  we do not consider our junior convertible trust preferred securities as debt for the purpose of determining our leverage ratio 
other liabilities reflect amounts payable to affiliate managers related to our purchase of additional affiliate equity interests 
this table does not include liabilities for uncertain tax positions million as of december  as we cannot predict when such liabilities will be paid 

table of contents market risk our revenue is derived primarily from fees which are based on the market values of assets under management 
such values are affected by changes in financial markets  and accordingly declines in the financial markets will negatively impact our revenue and net income 
the broader financial markets are affected  in part  by changing interest rates 
we cannot predict the effects that interest rates or changes in interest rates may have on either the broader financial markets or our affiliates assets under management and associated fees 
we pay a variable rate of interest on our credit facility million outstanding as of december  and  until february  paid a variable rate of interest on our floating rate senior convertible securities 
we have fixed rates of interest on our zero coupon senior convertible notes  our senior convertible notes and on both of our junior convertible trust preferred securities 
from time to time  we seek to manage our exposure to changing interest rates by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
for example  through february  we were a party to interest rate hedging contracts with a million notional amount  which fixed the interest rate on a portion of our floating rate senior convertible securities to a weighted average interest rate of approximately for the period from february to february we estimate that a basis point change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense related to our variable rate borrowings of approximately million 
while a change in market interest rates would not affect the interest expense incurred on our fixed rate securities  such a change may affect the fair value of these securities 
we estimate that a basis point change in interest rates would result in a net change in the value of our fixed rate securities of approximately million 
we operate primarily in the united states  and accordingly most of our consolidated revenue and associated expenses are denominated in us dollars 
we also provide services and earn revenue outside of the united states  therefore  the portion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies may be impacted by movements in currency exchange rates 
the valuations of our foreign affiliates are impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  which could be recorded as a component of stockholders equity 
to illustrate the effect of possible changes in currency exchange rates  as of december   we estimate that a change in the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate would result in approximately a million change to stockholders equity and a million change to income before income taxes 
during  changes in currency exchange rates decreased stockholders equity by million 
recent accounting developments in september  the fasb issued fas no 
 fair value measurements fas which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and requires expanded disclosure about fair value measurements 
as described in note of our consolidated financial statements  we adopted this standard in the first quarter of for our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis 
for all other nonfinancial assets and liabilities  fas is effective in the first quarter of the standard is not expected to have a material impact our consolidated financial statements  but will require certain additional disclosures 
in february  the fasb issued fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
we adopted fas in the first quarter of  as we did not apply the fair value option to any of our outstanding instruments  fas did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued fas no 
revised  business combinations fas r  which is effective in the first quarter of 
fas r will require acquirors to measure identifiable assets and liabilities at their full fair values on the acquisition date 
fas r will also change the treatment of contingent consideration  contingencies  acquisition costs  and restructuring costs 
fas r will be applied to future acquisitions  and its impact will depend on the nature and volume of those transactions 
upon adoption  fas r will be retrospectively applied to acquisition costs previously deferred  and we anticipate that and earnings will be adjusted by million and million  respectively 
in december  the fasb issued fas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
fas 
fas will change the accounting and reporting for minority or noncontrolling interests 
upon adoption  these interests and transactions between controlling interest and minority interest holders may be accounted for within stockholders equity 
fas also requires an entity to present net income and consolidated comprehensive income attributable to the parent and the minority interest separately in the consolidated financial statements 
we will adopt fas in the first quarter of in march  the sec announced revisions to eitf topic d classification and measurement of redeemable securities topic d  which provides sec registrants guidance on the financial statement classification and measurement of equity securities that are subject to mandatory redemption requirements or whose redemption is outside the control of the issuer 
the revised topic d requires redeemable minority interests  such as the equity interests held by our affiliates described in note to the consolidated financial statements  to be recorded outside of permanent equity at their current redemption value  and the interests should be adjusted to their current redemption value at each balance sheet date 
adjustments to the carrying amount of a noncontrolling interest from the application of topic d are recorded to stockholders equity 
we will adopt this guidance in  resulting in our recording the current redemption value of our redeemable non controlling interests with a corresponding adjustment to stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
in march  the fasb issued fas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas requires enhanced disclosures regarding the impact of derivatives on our financial position  financial performance  and cash flows

in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb  which applies to all convertible debt instruments that may be settled either wholly or partially in cash upon conversion 
fsp apb requires issuers to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments in a manner reflective of the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
previous guidance required these types of convertible debt instruments to be accounted for entirely as debt 
fsp apb is effective in the first quarter of and will be retrospectively applied to prior periods 
we expect that fsp apb will increase interest expense for our convertible securities by approximately million in in june  the fasb ratified eitf no 
 determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf 
eitf provides guidance for determining whether an equity linked financial instrument  or embedded feature  is indexed to an entity s own stock 
we will adopt eitf in the first quarter of and do not expect the adoption to change the classification or measurement of our financial instruments 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp fas  which 
table of contents applies to financial assets that are required or permitted to be measured at fair value in accordance with fas fsp fas clarifies the application of fas and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
the adoption did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations  nor did it have a significant impact on the valuation techniques we used in measuring the fair value of our financial assets 
in november  the fasb ratified eitf  equity method investment accounting considerations eitf 
eitf clarifies that the initial carrying value of an equity method investment should be determined in accordance with fas r and other than temporary impairments of equity method investments should be recognized in accordance with apb opinion no

eitf is effective on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of we are assessing the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of eitf on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in november  the fasb ratified eitf  accounting for defensive intangible assets eitf 
eitf applies to defensive assets which are acquired intangible assets which the acquirer does not intend to actively use  but intends to hold to prevent its competitors from obtaining access to the asset 
eitf clarifies that defensive intangible assets are separately identifiable and should be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting in accordance with fas r and fas eitf is effective for intangible assets acquired in we are assessing the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of eitf on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas and fin r  disclosures by public entities enterprises about transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities fsp fas and fin r 
this guidance increases disclosure requirements for public entities involved in securitization or asset backed financing arrangements and variable interest entities 
we adopted fsp fas and fin r in the fourth quarter of and such adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and judgments the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting estimates and judgments 
these policies are affected significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
valuation in allocating the purchase price of our investments and testing our assets for impairment  we make estimates and assumptions to determine the value of our acquired client relationships  operating segments  and equity method investments 
we also assess the value of minority interests held by our affiliate managers in establishing the terms for their transfer 
in these valuations  we make assumptions about the growth rates and useful lives of existing and prospective client accounts  as well as future earnings  valuation multiples  tax benefits and discount rates 
we consider the reasonableness of our assumptions by comparing our valuation conclusions to 
table of contents market transactions  and in certain instances engage third party consultants to perform independent evaluations 
if we used different assumptions  the effect may be material to our financial statements  as the carrying value of our equity method investments and intangible assets and related amortization could be stated differently and our impairment conclusions could be modified 
the use of different assumptions to value our minority interests could change the amount of compensation expense  if any  we report upon their transfer 
goodwill as of december   the carrying value of goodwill was  million 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the fair value of identified assets and liabilities 
goodwill impairment tests are performed annually at the reporting unit level in our case  our three operating segments  or more frequently  should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying amount 
for purposes of the impairment test of goodwill  the fair value of each reporting unit is measured by applying a fair value multiple to the run rate cash flow of the reporting unit 
the key valuation inputs are the levels of asset under management  their related fee rates  and expenses attributable to each reporting unit 
changes in the estimates used in this test could materially affect our impairment conclusion 
in each of the third and fourth quarters of  we performed our impairment test  and no impairments were identified 
indefinite lived intangible assets as of december   the carrying value of indefinite lived intangible assets were million 
indefinite lived intangible assets are comprised of investment advisory contracts with registered investment companies that are sponsored by our affiliates 
we do not amortize our indefinite lived acquired client relationships because we expect these contracts will contribute to our cash flows indefinitely 
each quarter  we assess whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate these relationships might have a definite life 
we perform indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests annually  or more frequently should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying amount 
in this test we compare the carrying amount of each asset to its fair value  measuring value through a discounted cash flow analysis 
the key valuation assumptions include current and projected levels of assets under management in the relevant registered investment company  expenses attributable to these contracts and discount rates 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test  and no impairments were identified 
definite lived intangible assets as of december   the carrying values of definite lived intangible assets were million 
definite lived intangible assets are comprised of investment advisory contracts acquired in an affiliate investment 
we monitor the useful lives of these assets and revise them  if necessary 
we review historical and projected attrition rates and other events that may influence our projections of the future economic benefit that we will derive from these relationships 
significant judgment is required to estimate the period that these assets will contribute to our cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed 
a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a material impact on our amortization expense 
for example  if we reduced the weighted average 
table of contents remaining life of our definite lived acquired client relationships by one year  our amortization expense would increase by approximately million per year 
we perform definite lived intangible asset impairment tests annually  or more frequently should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying amount 
we assess each of our definite lived acquired client relationship for impairment by comparing their carrying value to the projected undiscounted cash flows of the acquired relationships 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test  and no impairments were identified 
equity method investments as of december   the carrying values of equity method investments were million 
our equity method investments are in affiliates in which we own a minority interest and have the ability to participate in decision making 
we evaluate these investments for impairment by assessing whether the fair value of the investment has declined below its carrying value for a period we consider other than temporary 
if we determine that a decline in fair value below our carrying value is other than temporary  an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the investment to its fair value 
we measure the fair value of each of our equity method investments by applying a fair value multiple to estimates of the run rate cash flow 
our fair value multiples are supported by observed transactions and discounted cash flow analyses which reflect assumptions of current and projected levels of affiliate assets under management  fee rates and estimated expenses 
changes in estimates used in these valuations could materially affect the impairment conclusions 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our evaluation of investments accounted for under the equity method and concluded a decline in the market value of our recent investments in valueact and bluemountain was other than temporary 
accordingly  we reduced the carrying value of these investments by million 
income taxes our overall tax position requires analysis to estimate the expected realization of tax assets and liabilities 
tax regulations often require income and expense to be included in our tax returns in different amounts and in different periods than are reflected in the financial statements 
additionally  we must assess whether to recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position  and  if so  the appropriate amount of the benefit 
deferred taxes are established to reflect the differences in timing between the inclusion of items of income and expense in the financial statements and their reporting on our tax returns 
our deferred tax liabilities are generated primarily from tax deductible intangible assets and convertible securities 
we generally believe that our intangible related deferred taxes are unlikely to reverse  and that our deferred tax liabilities for convertible securities may not reverse 
as such  we currently believe the economic benefit we realize from these sources may be permanent 
most of our intangible assets are tax deductible because we generally structure our affiliate investments as cash transactions that are taxable to the sellers 
we record deferred taxes because a substantial majority of our intangible assets do not amortize for financial statement purposes  but do amortize for tax purposes  thereby creating tax deductions that reduce our current cash taxes 
these liabilities will reverse only in the event of a sale of an affiliate or an impairment charge 
under current accounting rules  we are required to accrue the estimated cost of such a reversal as a deferred tax liability 
as of december   our estimate of the tax liability associated with such a sale or impairment charge was approximately million 

table of contents during  our convertible securities generated deferred taxes of approximately million because our interest deductions for tax purposes are greater than our reported interest expense 
we believe that some or all of these deferred tax liabilities may be reclassified to equity when the securities convert to common stock 
we also regularly assess our deferred tax assets  which consist primarily of tax loss carryforwards  in order to determine the need for valuation allowances 
in our assessment we make assumptions about future taxable income that may be generated to utilize these assets  which have limited lives 
if we determine that we are unlikely to realize the benefit of a deferred tax asset  we establish a valuation allowance that would increase our tax expense in the period of such determination 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance for all of our loss carryforwards 
in the event that massachusetts adopts certain income tax regulations which were recently released in proposed form  we could potentially reverse approximately million of our valuation allowance on net operating losses 
in our assessment of uncertain tax positions  we consider the probability that a tax authority would sustain our tax position in an examination 
for tax positions meeting a more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the benefit expected to be realized upon the ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
for tax positions not meeting this threshold  no benefit is recognized 
changes in our tax position could have a material impact on our earnings 
for example  a increase to our statutory tax rate attributable to our deferred tax liabilities would result in an increase of approximately million in our tax expense in the period of such determination 
share based compensation we have share based compensation plans covering senior management  employees and directors 
prior to  we accounted for share based compensation using the intrinsic value method described in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations 
accordingly  prior to  no compensation expense was recognized from share based compensation plans as the exercise price of all stock options granted equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award 
in  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fas r which requires a company to recognize share based compensation  based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date 
as a result  compensation is recognized in the financial statements for all share based payments granted after the date of adoption  and for all awards that are unvested after that date 
under fas r  we estimate the fair value of stock option awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires us to make assumptions about the volatility of our common stock and the expected life of our stock options based on past experience and anticipated future exercise behavior 
we consider both the historical volatility of our common stock and the implied volatility from traded options in determining expected volatility 
given unprecedented market volatility during the latter part of  we did not include the trading activity for the three months preceding our fourth quarter award in calculating the fair value of our stock options 
our options typically vest and become fully exercisable over three to five years of continued employment and do not include performance based or market based vesting conditions 
for grants that are subject to graded vesting over a service period  we recognize expense net of expected forfeitures on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
as of december   we had million in remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option grants  which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately four years assuming no forfeitures 

table of contents revenue recognition the majority of our consolidated revenue represents advisory fees asset based and performance based 
our affiliates recognize asset based advisory fees quarterly as they render services to their clients 
in addition to generating asset based fees  over affiliate products  representing approximately billion of assets under management  also bill on the basis of absolute investment performance performance fees 
these products  which are primarily in the institutional distribution channel  are generally structured to have returns that are not directly correlated to changes in broader equity indices and  if earned  the performance fee component is typically billed less frequently than the asset based fee 
our affiliates recognize performance fees when they are earned ie when they become billable to customers based on the contractual terms of agreements and when collection is reasonably assured 
although performance fees inherently depend on investment results and will vary from period to period  we anticipate performance fees to be a recurring component of our revenue 
economic and market conditions international operations in connection with our international distribution initiatives  we have offices in sydney  australia and london  england 
in addition  we have international operations through affiliates who provide some or a significant part of their investment management services to non us clients 
in the future  we may open additional offices  or invest in other investment management firms which conduct a significant part of their operations outside of the united states 
there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  such as changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  difficulties in collecting investment advisory fees receivable  different and in some cases  less stringent  regulatory and accounting regimes  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  expatriation controls  expropriation risks and potential adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or our affiliated investment management firms that have international operations or on other investment management firms in which we may invest in the future and  consequently  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation or changing prices have had a material impact on our results of operations
