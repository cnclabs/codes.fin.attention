general management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is intended to assist the reader in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial position of the company together with its subsidiary 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying financial notes  and with the critical accounting policies noted below 
the company s fiscal year begins on april and ends on march unless otherwise noted  all references in this document to a particular year shall mean the company s fiscal year ending on march as previously discussed  the company s avionics business is conducted in the government  commercial and general aviation markets see note of notes to financial statements for segment financial information 
in january  the company completed its acquisition of iti  a company selling products to the marine industry  and iti s financial statements were consolidated with the company s financial statements since then 
as a result of the lack of growth in this business  and the anticipated growth of the avionics business  the company decided to divest itself of iti and focus on the avionics segment 
as a result  in fiscal years and  the company treated iti as a discontinued operation 
the financial statements have been prepared segregating the company s discontinued iti business  and fiscal year also includes a charge to write off the remaining assets of iti see note to the consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview for the fiscal year ended march   the company reported substantial increases in sales and profits over the prior fiscal year and substantial improvements in its gross margin percentage  working capital and shareholder equity 
in february  the company won a competitive bid and was awarded a five year firm fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq by the us army aviation and missile command for the ts iff test set  with a maximum dollar value of  depending on the number of units purchased 
in the last three years  as previously reported  the company also won two large competitive bid contracts from the us navy  the craft and itats programs  with an aggregate maximum value of approximately million 
these contracts have required and will require over the next fiscal year substantial engineering and development costs 
delivery of the an usm unit  a derivative of the craft an usm  began in calendar year the company believes that production deliveries of the itats unit  the an arm  should commence in the third quarter of the current fiscal year  and production deliveries of the main craft unit an arm and the ts test set and kits should begin in calendar year the products developed under these contracts represent new generation technology  which should provide the company with a competitive edge for years to come 
because of the continuing decline in commercial sales  the difficult economic environment  delays in several major government orders  and the temporarily high new product engineering costs  the company expects that sales and profits in the first half of the current fiscal year will decline materially  until substantial production and delivery of the new products commence 
the financial situation for the company is expected to markedly improve in the second half of the current fiscal year and the company expects to be profitable in the next fiscal year 
after the company was awarded the army contract for the ts program  discussed above  aeroflex wichita  inc a competing bidder  aeroflex filed a protest with the general accounting office gao alleging that tel won the award by using aeroflex s proprietary technology 
tel denied aeroflex s allegations and the army filed two extensive statements with the gao refuting each of aeroflex s allegations and explaining that tel used only tel s own  new generation proprietary technology 
on april   aeroflex withdrew its protest  and shortly thereafter  the army withdrew its prior statutory stop work order 
since then tel has been working on this project 
in march  aeroflex filed an action against tel and two of its employees in the civil court in wichita  kansas  making substantially the same allegations that it made in its protest to the gao 
tel denied those allegations and is contesting the claim in the kansas court 
based  among other things  on tel s knowledge of the technology involved and the army s detailed and emphatic refutation of aeroflex s allegations  tel believes that aeroflex s claims are without merit 
however  tel anticipates that it will incur legal fees in connection with the litigation  and these costs will have an adverse effect on its results of operations for the fiscal year ending march item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overview continued at march   the company had an outstanding loan balance of  on its line of credit  an increase over the prior year

avionics commercial sales decreased from prior year by  to  this decrease is mostly attributed to decreases in sales of the tr multi function test set and the t c  as a result of the continued weak financial condition of the commercial airline industry 
gross margin gross margin increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in gross margin is primarily attributed to the increase in volume and higher gross profit percentage resulting from a change in the sales mix 
the increase in gross profit dollars is also attributed to a negotiated billing to the government in the amount of  for additional work previously performed and expensed on the craft program 
the gross margin percentage for the fiscal year ended march  was as compared to for the fiscal year ended march  operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the prior fiscal year  primarily as a result of an increase in salary and other payroll related expenses k  and an increase in sales commissions to independent representatives k 
engineering  research and development expenses increased  to  for fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase is mostly attributed to efforts related to the craft program 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations compared to continued interest  net interest income decreased as a result of lower average cash balances

this increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributed to the company generating an operating profit for the year and the decrease in unbilled receivables as compared to the prior fiscal year  mostly offset by the decrease in accounts payable 
the cash balance at march  was  as compared to  at march  for the year ended march   the company used  in investing activities as compared to using  in fiscal year the decrease is attributed to a decline in capital asset purchases 
cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal year as compared to  in fiscal year this decrease is primarily attributed to lower new borrowings from the line of credit and a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by proceeds from a loan on the cash surrender value of a life insurance policy 
at march  the company had an outstanding loan balance of  on which it currently pays interest 
the line of credit is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the bank extended the credit agreement until september   and the new agreement includes a new expanded borrowing base 
as of march   remaining availability under this modified line was approximately  based upon eligible receivables and inventories at march  in the first quarter of the current fiscal year the company did not make any additional borrowings  and the remaining availability was approximately  at june  on certain government contracts the company has been granted progress payments from the government  which allows the company to bill and collect a portion of its incurred costs on long term programs  thus helping to fund the upfront costs of these programs 
the company believes that it has adequate liquidity  backlog and borrowing resources to fund operating plans for at least the next twelve months 
currently  the company has no material capital expenditure requirements 
there was no significant impact on the company s operations as a result of inflation for the year ended march  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  the company applies its accounting policies as disclosed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounting policies that require a higher degree of judgment and complexity used in the preparation of financial statements include revenue recognition revenues are recognized at the time of shipment to  or acceptance by customer  provided title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer 
provisions  when appropriate  are made where the right to return exists 
revenues on repairs and calibrations are recognized at the time the repaired or calibrated unit is shipped  as it is at this time that the work is completed 
due to the unique nature of the itats program wherein a significant portion of this contract will not be delivered for over a year  revenues under this contract are recognized on a percentage of completion basis  which recognizes sales and profit as they are earned  rather than at the time of shipment 
revenues and profits are estimated using the cost to cost method of accounting where revenues are recognized and profits recorded based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date to our estimate of total costs at completion 
the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion is applied to the contract value to determine the revenues and profits 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required  any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception to date effect of the changes on current and prior periods 
the company also receives progress billings on this program  which is a funding mechanism by the government to assist contractors on long term contracts prior to delivery 
shipping and handling costs charged to customers are classified as revenue  and the shipping and handling costs incurred are included in cost of goods sold 
payments received prior to the delivery of units or services performed are recorded as deferred revenues 
inventory reserves inventory reserves or write downs are estimated for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these estimates are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
warranty reserves warranty reserves are based upon historical rates and specific items that are identifiable and can be estimated at time of sale 
while warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  future warranty costs could be in excess of our warranty reserves 
a significant increase in these costs could adversely affect operating results for the current period and any future periods these additional costs materialize 
warranty reserves are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based on customer payment and current credit worthiness  as determined by review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors credits and payments from its customers and maintains provision for estimated credit losses based on its historical experience and any specific customer issues that have been identified 
for the year ended march  approximately of the company s sales were to the us government 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectation and the provision established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to receive positive results 
income taxes deferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources  the most significant being a tax losses that can be carried forward to be utilized against profits in future years  b expenses recognized in the books but disallowed in the tax return until the associated cash flow occurs  and c valuation changes of assets which need to be tax effected for book purposes but are taxable only when the valuation change is realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse 
the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced  if necessary  by a valuation allowance for any tax benefit which is not more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  future taxable income is estimated  considering the realization of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can also be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event it was determined that the company would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period in which that determination is made 
in its evaluation of a valuation allowance the company takes into account existing contracts and backlog  and the probability that options under these contract awards will be exercised as well as sales of existing products 
the company prepares profit projections based on the revenue and expenses forecast to determine that such revenues will produce sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets off balance sheet arrangements the company is not party to any off balance sheet arrangements that may affect its financial position or its results of operations item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfac no r  business combinations 
this statement provides new accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for business combinations 
sfas no r is effective for business combinations which occur in the first fiscal year beginning on or after december  the adoption of sfas r will not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements or financial position  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions the company consummates after the effective date 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which modifies and expands the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires that objectives for using derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of underlying risk and accounting designation and requires quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts and gains and losses on derivative instruments 
it also requires disclosures about credit related contingent features in derivative agreements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  sfas encourages  but does not require  comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption 
the company adopted this standard effective january  the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on the disclosures related to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fsp fas fas and apb  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
this fsp amends fasb statement no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements 
this fsp also amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods 
fsp fas and apb are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  the company will make the disclosures required by this statement
