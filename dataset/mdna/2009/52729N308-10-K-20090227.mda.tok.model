the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
level communications  inc  through its operating subsidiaries  is primarily engaged in the communications business  with additional operations in coal mining 
communications business the company is a facilities based provider of a broad range of communications services 
revenue for communications services is recognized on a monthly basis as these services are provided 
for contracts involving private line  wavelengths and dark fiber services  level may receive up front payments for services to be delivered for a period of generally up to years 
in these situations  level defers the revenue and amortizes it on a straight line basis to earnings over the term of the contract 
at december   for contracts where up front payments were received for services to be delivered in the future  the company s weighted average remaining contract period was approximately years 
communications revenue consists of core communications services other communications services the two categories of communications revenue are in different phases of the service life cycle  requiring different levels of investment and focus  and providing different contributions to the company s communications adjusted ebitda 
management of level believes that growth in revenue from its core communications services is critical to the long term success of its communications business 
at the same time  the company believes it must continue to effectively manage the positive cash flows from its other communications services 
core communications services includes revenue from core network services and wholesale voice services 
core network services revenue represents higher margin services and wholesale voice services represents lower margin services 
the company believes that trends in the communications business are best gauged by looking at revenue trends in core network services 
the company manages wholesale voice performance based on gross margin contribution 
core network services includes revenue from transport and infrastructure  ip and data services  including content delivery network services  local and enterprise voice services and level vyvx broadcast services 
wholesale voice services includes revenue from long distance voice services  including domestic voice termination  international voice termination and toll free services 
other communications services includes revenue from managed modem and its related reciprocal compensation services and sbc contract services  which includes revenue from the sbc master services agreement  which was obtained in the december acquisition of wiltel communications group  llc wiltel 

table of contents core communications services the company s transport and infrastructure services include metropolitan and intercity wavelengths  private line  ethernet private line  dark fiber  colocation services  professional services and transoceanic services 
growth in transport and infrastructure revenue is largely dependent on increased demand for bandwidth services and available capital of companies requiring communications capacity for their own use or in providing capacity as a service provider to their customers 
these expenditures may be in the form of monthly payments or up front payments for private line  wavelength or dark fiber services 
the company is focused on providing end to end transport services to its customers to directly connect customer locations with a private network 
pricing for end to end services has been stable 
for metropolitan transport services  prices have been stable and in some instances are increasing 
for intercity transport services  the company continues to experience pricing pressure for point to point locations  particularly in locations where a large number of carriers co locate their facilities 
an increase in demand may be partially offset by declines in unit pricing 
ip and data services primarily include the company s high speed internet access service  dedicated internet access dia service  atm and frame relay services  ip and ethernet virtual private network vpn services  and content delivery network cdn services  which includes streaming services 
level s internet access service is a high quality and high speed internet access service offered in a variety of capacities 
the company s vpn services permit businesses of any size to replace multiple networks with a single  cost effective solution that greatly simplifies the converged transmission of voice  video  and data 
this convergence to a single platform can be obtained without sacrificing the quality of service or security levels of traditional atm and frame relay offerings 
vpn services also permit customers to prioritize network application traffic so that high priority applications  such as voice and video  are not compromised in performance by the flow of low priority applications such as email 
the company believes that one of the largest sources of future incremental demand for the company s core communications services will be from customers that are seeking to distribute their feature rich content or video over the internet 
revenue growth in this area is dependent on the continued increase in usage by both enterprises and consumers and the pricing environment 
an increase in the reliability and security of information transmitted over the internet and declines in the cost to transmit data have resulted in increased utilization of e commerce or web based services by businesses 
although the pricing for data services is currently stable  the ip market is generally characterized by price compression and high unit growth rates depending upon the type of service  resulting in growth in absolute revenue 
the company experienced price compression in the high speed ip market in and expects that pricing for its high speed ip services will continue to decline in the company s core network services includes local and enterprise voice services 
local voice services are primarily components that enable other service providers to deliver business or consumer ready voice products to their end customers 
enterprise voice services are business grade voice services that the company sells directly to its business customers 
the company  through its level vyvx business  provides transport services for the audio and video programming of its customers over the company s fiber optic network and via satellite 
it uses the company s fiber optic network to carry live traditional broadcast and cable television events from the site of the event to the network control centers of the broadcasters of the event 
for live events where the location is not known in advance  such as breaking news stories in remote locations  the company provides an integrated satellite and fiber optic network based service to transmit the content to its customers 
most of level vyvx s customers for these services contract for the service on an event by event basis  however  there are some customers who have purchased a dedicated point to point service which enables these customers to transmit programming at any time 

table of contents prior to the sale of the vyvx advertising distribution business  level vyvx distributed advertising spots to radio and television stations throughout the us  both electronically and in physical form 
customers for these services utilized a network based method for aggregating  managing  storing and distributing content for content owners and rights holders 
on june   level completed the sale of its vyvx advertising distribution business to dg fastchannel  inc and received gross proceeds at closing of approximately million in cash 
level has retained ownership of vyvx s core broadcast business  including the vyvx services broadcast business content distribution capabilities

the company has developed content distribution services through the acquisition of the content delivery network services business cdn business of savvis  which it purchased in january from savvis  and the acquisition of dublin  ireland based servecast ltd  which it purchased in july the company believes that the addition of the cdn business with its strong  broad portfolio of patents will help the company secure its commercial efforts in the heavily patented cdn market  in which a number of competitors have significant  patented intellectual property 
level believes that one of the largest sources of future incremental demand for communications services will be derived from customers that are seeking to distribute their feature rich content or video over the internet 
the company offers wholesale voice services that target large and existing markets 
the revenue potential for wholesale voice services is large  however  the pricing and margins are expected to continue to decline over time as a result of the new low cost ip and optical based technologies 
in addition  the market for wholesale voice services is being targeted by many competitors  several of which are larger and have more financial resources than the company 
core communications services market groups in order to serve the changing needs of customers in growing markets and to drive growth across the communications organization  core communications services revenue by customer is also disaggregated into four customer facing market groups as follows the wholesale markets group services the communications needs of the largest national and global service providers  including carriers  cable companies  wireless companies  voice service providers  systems integrators and the federal government 
these customers typically integrate level services into their own products and services to offer to their end user customers 
the business markets group targets enterprise customers and regional carriers who value a local  professional sales force 
specific customer markets include medium and large businesses  local and regional carriers  state and local government entities  and higher education institutions and consortia 
the content markets group focuses on serving media and content companies with large and growing bandwidth needs 
customers in this market include video distribution companies  providers of gaming  mega portals  software service providers  social networking providers  as well as more traditional media distribution companies such as broadcasters  satellite companies  television networks and sports leagues 
the european markets group serves large european consumers of bandwidth  including the largest european and international carriers  large system integrators  voice service providers  
table of contents cable operators  internet service providers  content providers  and government and education sectors 
the company believes that the alignment of core communications services around customer markets should allow it to drive growth while enabling it to better focus on the needs of its customers 
each of these groups is supported by dedicated employees in sales and marketing 
each of these groups is also supported by non dedicated  centralized service or product management and development  corporate marketing  global network services  engineering  information technology  and corporate functions including legal  finance  strategy and human resources 
core communications services revenue by customer facing market group was as follows year ended december  dollars in millions wholesale markets group business markets group content markets group european markets group total core communications services the classification of customers within each customer facing market group can change based upon sales team assignments  merger and acquisition activity by customers and other factors 
other communications services the company s other communications services are mature services that are not critical areas of emphasis for the company 
other communications services includes revenue from managed modem and its related reciprocal compensation services and sbc contract services  which includes revenue derived under the sbc master services agreement that was obtained in the wiltel acquisition 
the company and its customers continue to see consumers migrate from narrow band dial up services to higher speed broadband services as the narrow band market matures 
additionally  america online  a primary consumer of the company s dial up services  has been implementing a strategic change in its approach to its dial up internet access business over the past few years that has accelerated the loss of its dial up subscribers 
during  america online s strategy accelerated the decline in managed modem revenue and contributed to further declines in managed modem revenue in the company recognized approximately million of managed modem revenue in  a decline from the million of managed modem revenue recognized in the declines in managed modem revenue from america online have been offset to some extent by an increase in market share as a result of certain competitors exiting segments of this business 
the company believes that the low cost structure of its network will enable it to compete aggressively for new business in the declining managed modem market 
the company receives compensation from other carriers when it terminates traffic originating on those carriers networks 
this reciprocal compensation is based on interconnection agreements with the respective carriers or rates mandated by the fcc 
the company has interconnection agreements in place for the majority of traffic subject to reciprocal compensation 
in addition  a majority of the company s existing reciprocal compensation revenue is associated with agreements that are in effect through or beyond 
the company continues to negotiate new interconnection agreements or amendments to its existing interconnection agreements with local carriers as needed 
the company earns the majority of its reciprocal compensation revenue from providing managed modem services 
the company also receives reciprocal compensation from its voice services 

table of contents communications business strategy and objectives the company s management continues to review all existing lines of business and service offerings to determine how those lines of business and service offerings enhance the company s focus on delivery of communications services and meeting its financial objectives 
to the extent that certain lines of business  business groups or service offerings are not considered to be compatible with the delivery of the company s services or with meeting its financial objectives  level may exit those lines of business or stop offering those services 
the company is focusing its attention on the following operational and financial objectives increasing sales  improving the customer experience to increase customer retention and reducing customer churn  achieving sustainable generation of positive cash flows from operations in excess of capital expenditures  reducing network costs and operating expenses  growing core communications services revenue  particularly core network services revenue  continuing to show improvements in adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue  completing the integration of acquired businesses  growing its content delivery network services  continuing to implement its metro network strategy  managing cash flows provided by its other communications services  and refinancing its future debt maturities 
the company s management believes the introduction of new services or technologies  as well as the further development of existing technologies  may reduce the cost or increase the supply of certain services similar to those provided by level the ability of the company to anticipate  adapt and invest in these technology changes in a timely manner may affect the company s future success 
in  the company strategically expanded its presence in metropolitan markets and began offering services to enterprise customers through its business markets group 
this strategy allowed the company to terminate traffic over its owned facilities rather than paying third parties to terminate the traffic 
the expansion into new metro markets also provided additional opportunities to sell services to bandwidth intensive businesses on the company s national and international networks 
in order to expedite the expansion of its metro business  level acquired progress telecom  icg communications  telcove and looking glass in and broadwing in the first quarter of level also strategically expanded its content delivery network services with the acquisitions of the cdn business in the first quarter of and servecast in the third quarter of the results of operations attributable to each acquisition are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition

successful integration of these acquired businesses continues to depend on the company s ability to manage these operations  realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by strengthened service offerings and expanded geographic market coverage  and to eliminate redundant and excess costs to fully realize the expected synergies 
if the company is not able to efficiently and effectively continue to integrate the acquired businesses or operations  the company may experience material negative consequences to its business  financial condition or results of operations 
in  during the second quarter and portions of the third quarter  the company s service activation times increased as a result of the following issues continuing to use the multiple order entry and provisioning systems and processes that were operated by the acquired companies to provision end to end services 
insufficient training on the multiple systems for employees performing service activation functions 
lack of sufficient staffing levels in some service activation areas 
identifying and fixing service activation throughput issues was challenging as a result of decentralizing service activation functions across the customer facing groups 
this increase in service activation cycle time had a negative effect on the company s service installation intervals and the rate of core communications services revenue growth during during this same period  the company also experienced challenges in its service management processes that resulted in longer response times to resolve customer s network service issues 
as a result of consolidating key operational functions and organizations as part of the integration effort  the company s operating environment became more complex in the first half of during the second and third quarters of  the company implemented certain process and organizational changes that were expected to improve service activation times and allow it to achieve its previously forecasted revenue and adjusted ebitda growth 
however  these changes were not adequate to address the breadth of the problems encountered during the second and third quarters of as a result of these service activation and service management issues  the growth in communications services revenue and adjusted ebitda was lower than originally expected for the full year the company has taken steps to improve its existing processes and systems to address the increase in service activation times and improve its service management 
with respect to the latter  the company saw improvements in its service management during the fourth quarter of and in additionally  the company believes it has implemented sufficient improvements in service activation capabilities to match installation capacity to customer demand for services

table of contents assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while the company has other accounting policies that involve estimates such as the allowance for doubtful accounts  revenue reserves  useful lives of long lived assets  accruals for estimated tax and legal liabilities  cost of revenue disputes for communications services  valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  and unfavorable contracts recognized in purchase accounting  management has identified the policies below  which require the most significant judgments and estimates to be made in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
revenue revenue for communications services  including transport  infrastructure  data  colocation  ip  vyvx broadcast  voice  and managed modem  is recognized monthly as the services are provided 
communications services are provided either on a usage basis  which can vary period to period  or at a contractually committed amount 
reciprocal compensation revenue is recognized when an interconnection agreement is in place with another carrier  or if an agreement has expired  when the parties have agreed to continue operating under the previous agreement until a new agreement is negotiated and executed  or at rates mandated by the fcc 
periodically  the company will receive payment for reciprocal compensation services in excess of fcc rates and before an agreement is in place 
these amounts are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets until a final agreement has been reached and the necessary regulatory approvals have been received at which time the reciprocal compensation revenue is recognized 
these amounts were insignificant to the company in  and revenue attributable to leases of dark fiber pursuant to indefeasible rights of use agreements irus that qualified for sales type lease accounting and were entered into prior to june   were recognized at the time of delivery and acceptance of the fiber by the customer 
certain sale and long term iru agreements of dark fiber and capacity entered into after june   are required to be accounted for in the same manner as sales of real estate with property improvements or integral equipment 
this accounting treatment results in the deferral of revenue for the cash that has been received and the recognition of revenue ratably over the term of the agreement generally up to years 
termination revenue is recognized when a customer disconnects service prior to the end of the contract period and for which level had previously received consideration and for which revenue recognition was deferred 
termination revenue is also recognized when customers make termination penalty payments to level to settle contractually committed purchase amounts that the customer no longer expects to meet or when a customer and level renegotiate a contract under which level is no longer obligated to provide product or services for consideration previously received and for which revenue recognition has been deferred 
termination revenue is reported in the same manner as the original product or service provided 
accounting practice and guidance with respect to the accounting treatment of revenue continues to evolve 
any changes in the accounting treatment could affect the manner in which the company accounts for revenue within its communications and coal businesses

r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  the company recognizes stock based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate  recognizing compensation cost for only those awards expected to vest over the requisite service period of the awards 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the company issues outperform stock options in which the value received is based on a formula involving a multiplier related to the level by which the company s common stock outperforms the s p index 
the company utilizes a modified black scholes model due to the additional variables required to calculate the effect of the success multiplier for its outperform stock options  including estimating the expected volatility of the s p index 
as a result of the deterioration of the company s stock price at the end of  the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding outperform stock options was zero as of december  the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and the company uses different assumptions  stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if actual forfeiture rates are materially different from the company s estimate  stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the company has recorded in the current period 
valuation of long lived assets the company performs an assessment of its long lived assets  including finite lived acquisition related intangible assets  for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets or asset groupings may not be recoverable 
this review requires the identification of the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of grouping assets subject to review 
the estimate of undiscounted cash flows includes long term forecasts of revenue growth  gross margins and operating expenses 
all of these items require significant judgment and assumptions 
the impairment analysis of long lived assets also requires the company to make certain subjective assumptions and estimates regarding the expected future use of certain additional conduits and the expected future use of certain empty conduit 
an impairment loss may exist when the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying amount 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  the amount of the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the long lived asset s carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value  based on management s assumptions and projections 
the company conducted a long lived asset impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of and concluded that its long lived assets  including finite lived acquisition related intangible assets  were not impaired 
to the extent that future changes in assumptions and estimates cause a change in estimates of future cash flows that indicate the carrying amount of the company s long lived assets  including finite lived acquisition related intangible assets  may not be recoverable  the company may incur impairment charges in the future to write down the carrying amount of the company s long lived assets  including finite lived acquisition related intangible assets  to their estimated fair value 
valuation of goodwill and acquired indefinite lived intangible assets the company performs an assessment of its goodwill for impairment annually at the end of the fourth quarter  or more frequently if the company determines that indicators of impairment exist 
the company s impairment review process compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying 
table of contents value 
the company s reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note to the consolidated financial statements 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a second step must be performed  and the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill must be determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded 
the company s fair value methodology consists of a quoted market price approach whereby the company calculates the market capitalization of level using quoted market prices  adds an estimated control premium  and then assigns that fair value to the reporting units 
the company also performs a discounted cash flow analysis that includes estimates of revenue  costs  growth rates and an appropriate discount rate 
these estimates are based on historical data  various internal estimates and management s expectations of future trends

asset retirement obligations the company s asset retirement obligations consist of legal requirements to remove certain of its network infrastructure at the expiration of the underlying right of way row term  restoration requirements for leased facilities and reclamation requirements in the coal mining business to remediate previously mined properties 
the initial and subsequent measurement of the company s asset retirement obligations require the company to make significant estimates regarding the eventual costs and probability or likelihood that the company will be required to remove certain of its network infrastructure  restore certain of its leased properties and remediate certain of its previously mined properties 
in addition  the company must estimate the periods over which these costs will be incurred and present value the total of such costs using the company s estimate of its credit adjusted risk free interest rate 

table of contents the company regularly evaluates its asset retirement obligations to determine if the amount and timing of its cash flow estimates continue to be appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
as a result of indicators suggesting that the estimated cash flows underlying the company s row asset retirement obligations were too high  the company revised its assessment on december  network infrastructure relocations indicated that the company is not being required to physically remove its underground network infrastructure at rates consistent with the company s previous estimates 
other internal and external information corroborated these lower rates 
as a result  on december   the company revised its probability assessment related to its requirement to physically remove its underground network infrastructure at the end of the underlying row terms  which caused a significant reduction to the related cash flows that the company believes will be required to settle its row asset retirement obligations

the company continues to experience strong demand for infrastructure and transport services for complex nationwide solutions and colocation capacity in large markets 
vyvx broadcast revenue increased primarily as a result of the proliferation of high definition sports  news and entertainment programming 
partially offsetting the increase in core network services revenue was lower vyvx advertising distribution revenue 
on june   the company completed the sale of the vyvx advertising distribution business and therefore only recorded vyvx advertising distribution revenue in from january  through june  revenue attributable to the vyvx advertising distribution business was million in compared to million in the increase in wholesale voice services revenue is attributable to an increase in voice termination and toll free voice services 
the growth in voice termination revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in demand from wireless carrier customers 
toll free revenue increased primarily due to higher traffic attributable to conferencing provider customers 
the company continues to concentrate its sales efforts on maintaining incremental gross margins in the range for these services 
the company expects to experience some volatility in revenue as a result of this strategy 
other communications revenue declined to million in from million in the decrease is primarily the result of a decline in managed modem revenue as a result of the continued migration from narrow band dial up services to higher speed broadband services by end user customers  especially in large metropolitan areas 
the company expects managed modem revenue to continue to decline in the future due to an increase in the number of subscribers migrating to broadband services and potential pricing concessions in as contracts are renewed 
reciprocal compensation revenue from managed modem services also declined in compared to as a result of the continuing decline in demand for managed modem services 
the company has historically earned the majority of its reciprocal compensation revenue from managed modem services  although the company continues to generate a portion of its reciprocal compensation revenue from voice services  which is reported within core network services revenue 
to the extent the company is unable to sign new interconnection agreements or signs new agreements containing lower rates  or there is a significant decline in the company s managed modem dial up business  or fcc or state regulations change such that carriers are not required to compensate other carriers for terminating isp bound traffic  reciprocal compensation revenue may decline significantly over time 

table of contents also contributing to the decrease in other communications revenue was lower sbc contract services revenue as a result of the migration of the sbc traffic to the at t network and the satisfaction by sbc of its gross margin commitment under the sbc master services agreement in during the second quarter of  the gross margin commitment on the sbc master services agreement was satisfied  however at t  inc at t  which merged with sbc in  continues to purchase services from level under the sbc master services agreement as it continues to migrate the services provided under the agreement to its own network facilities

coal mining revenue increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of a long term supply contract that enabled a customer to buyout future coal purchase commitments with the company 
the company does not have any further obligations with respect to future coal commitments under the contract  and therefore recognized the transaction as revenue in partially offsetting this increase were lower volumes of coal sold in compared to cost of revenue for the communications business includes leased capacity  right of way costs  access charges  satellite transponder lease costs  and other third party costs directly attributable to the network  but excludes depreciation and amortization and related impairment expenses 
prior to the sale of the vyvx advertising distribution business  the company included in communications cost of revenue package delivery costs and the blank tape media costs associated with this business 
cost of revenue for the communications business  as a percentage of communications revenue  was in compared to in this decrease is primarily attributable to the synergies derived from acquisitions 
during and the first part of  the company was able to eliminate some of the costs associated with duplicate circuits serving the same markets 
also contributing to the decrease was the continued reduction in other communications services revenue  in particular  sbc contract services revenue 
the gross margins for sbc contract services revenue are lower than the gross margins for core communications services revenue and managed modem and reciprocal compensation from managed modem revenue 
partially offsetting this decrease were increases in wholesale voice services revenue as a percentage of total communications revenue and lower managed modem revenue 
the incremental gross margins for wholesale voice services revenue are in the range versus for core network services revenue and the gross margin for managed modem revenue is generally higher than for core network services revenue 
coal mining cost of revenue approximated of coal mining revenue in and in the increase in coal mining cost of revenue as a percentage of coal mining revenue in is the 
table of contents result of an increase in energy costs to mine the coal partially offset by the buyout by a coal customer of future coal purchase commitments resulting in the recognition of revenue with no associated costs in depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily attributable to the million reduction to depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the company revising its estimates of its asset retirement obligations liability in the fourth quarter of also contributing to the decrease was reduced amortization expense on intangible assets due to the disposal of million of carrying value of amortizable intangible assets in the vyvx advertising distribution sale and certain of the company s amortizable intangible assets becoming fully amortized in early these decreases in depreciation and amortization were partially offset by higher accelerated depreciation in on network infrastructure assets that were abandoned as a result of the company relocating small scale portions of its network and reductions in the useful lives of certain of the company s amortizable intangible assets in the second quarter of the company expects depreciation and amortization expense of between million to million in based on the company s current expectations of the timing and amounts of capital expenditures in selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries  wages and related benefits including non cash  stock based compensation expenses  property taxes  travel  insurance  rent  contract maintenance  advertising  accretion expense on asset retirement obligations and other administrative expenses

adjusted ebitda is not a measurement under gaap and may not be used in the same way by other companies 
management believes that adjusted ebitda is an important part of the company s internal reporting and is a key measure used by management to evaluate profitability and operating performance of the company and to make resource allocation decisions 
management believes such measurement is especially important in a capital intensive industry such as telecommunications 
management also uses adjusted ebitda to compare the company s performance to that of its competitors and to eliminate certain non cash and non operating items in order to consistently measure from period to period its ability to fund capital expenditures  fund growth  service debt and determine bonuses 
adjusted ebitda excludes non cash impairment charges and non cash stock compensation expense because of the non cash nature of these items 
adjusted ebitda also excludes interest income  interest expense  income taxes and gain loss on extinguishment of debt because these items are associated with the company s capitalization and tax structures 
adjusted ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization expense because these non cash expenses reflect the effect of capital investments which management believes should be evaluated through cash flow measures 
adjusted ebitda excludes the gain on sale of business groups and net other income expense because these items are not related to the primary operations of the company 
there are limitations to using non gaap financial measures  including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similar performance measures whose calculations may differ from the company s calculations 
additionally  this financial measure does not include certain significant items such as interest income  interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment charges  non cash stock compensation expense  gain loss on early extinguishment of debt  the gain on sale of business groups and net other income expense 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements provides a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda for each of the company s reportable operating segments 
adjusted ebitda for the communications business was billion in compared to million in the increase in adjusted ebitda for the communications business is primarily attributable to the growth in the company s core communications services revenue and the benefits of continued operating expense reductions from integration activities  partially offset by declines in other communications services revenue

the loss on extinguishment of debt consisted of a loss of million as a result of the refinancing of the company s senior secured credit agreement and certain debt exchanges  redemptions and repurchases prior to maturity

the company incurs income tax expense attributable to income in various level subsidiaries  including the coal business  that are required to file state or foreign income tax returns on a separate legal entity basis 
the company also recognizes accrued interest and penalties in income tax expense related to uncertain tax benefits that have not been recognized in the company s tax returns 
as of december   the company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately billion for federal income tax purposes 
under the rules prescribed by us internal revenue code irc section and applicable regulations  if certain transactions occur with respect to an entity s capital stock that result in a cumulative ownership shift of more than percentage points by percent stockholders over a testing period  annual limitations are imposed with respect to the entity s ability to utilize its net operating loss carry forwards and certain current deductions against any taxable income the entity achieves in future periods 
the company had entered into transactions over the testing period resulting in significant cumulative shifts in the ownership of its capital stock which alone would not have resulted in an ownership change under irc section however  when the company s actions are coupled with the trading activity in the company s common stock throughout by third party market participants  the company believes that in the company experienced a cumulative 
table of contents ownership change of more than percentage points by percent stockholders during the applicable testing period 
prior to the ownership change  the company had net operating loss carry forwards of billion 
the company believes that the limitation of its net operating loss carry forwards will not have a near term effect on its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
the company also believes that the limitation of its net operating loss carry forwards has an immaterial effect on the current intrinsic value of the company s business taken as a whole 
additional transactions could cause the company to incur a subsequent percentage point ownership change by percent stockholders and  if the company triggers the above noted irc imposed limitations  could further limit it from fully utilizing the remaining net operating loss carry forwards and certain current deductions to reduce income taxes

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk level is subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
as of december   the company had borrowed a total of billion primarily under a senior secured term loan due and floating rate senior notes due that bear interest at libor rates plus an applicable margin 
as the libor rates fluctuate  so too will the interest expense on amounts borrowed under the debt instruments 
the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate instruments at december   was approximately 
in march  level financing  inc  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  entered into two interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest payments on billion notional amount of floating rate debt 
the two interest rate swap agreements are with different counterparties and are for million each 
the interest rate swap agreements were effective beginning in and mature in january under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements  level receives interest payments based on rolling three month libor terms and pays interest at the fixed rate of under one arrangement and under the other 
level has designated the interest rate swap agreements as a cash flow hedge on the interest payments for billion of floating rate debt 
the remaining  or unhedged  variable rate debt has a weighted average interest rate of at december  a hypothetical increase in the weighted average rate by point ie a weighted average rate of would increase the company s annual interest expense by approximately million 
at december   the company had billion excluding fair value adjustments  discounts and premiums of fixed rate debt bearing a weighted average interest rate of 
a decline in interest rates in the future will not benefit the company with respect to the fixed rate debt due to the terms and conditions of the indentures relating to that debt that would require the company to repurchase the debt at specified premiums if redeemed early 
indicated changes in interest rates are based on hypothetical movements and are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur 
future earnings and losses will be affected by actual fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts a portion of its business in currencies other than the us dollar  the currency in which the company s consolidated financial statements are reported 
correspondingly  the company s operating results could be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate volatility relative to the us dollar 
the company s european subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency  as the majority of their revenue and purchases are transacted in their local currencies 
although the company continues to evaluate strategies to mitigate risks related to the effect of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the company will likely recognize gains or losses from international transactions 
changes in foreign currency rates could adversely effect the company s operating results
