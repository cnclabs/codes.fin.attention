overview our business segments are based on the organizational structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance 
our reportable business segments are i publishing  ii broadcasting  iii printing services  and iv other 
our publishing segment consists of the milwaukee journal sentinel  which serves as the only major daily newspaper for the milwaukee metropolitan area  and more than community newspapers and shoppers in wisconsin and florida 
our broadcasting segment consists of radio stations and television stations in states and the operation of a television station under a local marketing agreement 
our interactive media assets include approximately online enterprises that are associated with our publishing and broadcasting segments 
we also provide a wide range of commercial printing services  including printing of publications  professional journals and documentation material  through our printing services segment 
our other segment consists of a direct marketing services business and corporate expenses and eliminations 
over the past few years  fundamentals in the newspaper industry have deteriorated significantly 
continuing weakness in automotive advertising driven primarily by the domestic automobile industry  reductions in retail and classified rop advertising due in part to department store consolidation  weakened employment and real estate economics and a migration of advertising to the internet  circulation declines and online competition have negatively impacted newspaper industry revenues 
additionally  the continued housing market downturn has adversely impacted the newspaper industry  including real estate classified advertising as well as the home improvement  furniture and financial services advertising categories 
these conditions  along with a weakening economy  persisted in and we expect them to continue in future periods 
revenues in the broadcast industry are derived primarily from the sale of advertising time to local  national and political advertisers and to a lesser extent from barter  digital revenues  retransmission fees  network compensation and other revenues 
the broadcast industry continues to experience softness in television and radio advertising resulting from general economic pressures now impacting local and national economies  primarily in the housing  automobile and retail segments 
our publishing business was challenged in due to the continued softening of business conditions driven by the secular and cyclical influences affecting the newspaper industry 
classified advertising revenue  specifically for employment  real estate and automotive  decreased million in compared to retail advertising also decreased in compared to with weakness in a number of categories  including automotive  home improvement  finance insurance  furniture and furnishings  real estate and department store categories 
interactive revenue increased to million at our publishing businesses in compared to million in our publishing business recorded a million non cash impairment charge for goodwill and million for workforce reduction charges in our publishing business experienced a increase in newsprint pricing in and newsprint costs increased million compared to partially offsetting the increase in newsprint pricing  our consumption decreased by due to decreases in rop advertising  average net paid circulation and a decrease in waste 
our publishing business focused on expense controls and  despite the newsprint increase and excluding the non cash impairment charge and workforce reduction charges  total operating expenses decreased by in compared to the expense decrease was primarily due to a decrease in payroll and employee benefit costs 
revenue from broadcasting in decreased due to decreases in local and national advertising revenue  partially offset by increases in political and issue and olympic advertising revenue and an increase in revenue from our newly acquired television stations  kpse lp and kwba tv  in palm springs  ca and sierra vista  az tucson market  respectively 
our broadcasting business recorded a million non cash impairment charge for goodwill and broadcast licenses and a workforce reduction charge of million in total revenue and operating expenses were million and million  respectively  related to our newly acquired television stations 
excluding the non cash impairment and workforce reduction charges  total operating expenses decreased in compared to  including the newly acquired stations  as we remained diligent in focusing on cost reductions 
revenue at our printing services business decreased in compared to primarily due to a decrease in revenue from printing catalogs and documentation materials 
operating earnings at our printing services business decreased primarily due to the decrease in revenue 
revenue at our direct marketing services business decreased in compared to primarily due to a decrease in mailing services revenue 
the operating loss at our direct marketing services business narrowed in compared to primarily due a decrease in operating costs and expenses due to the decrease in revenue and a decrease in payroll and benefit costs 
intangible asset impairment tests due to deteriorating macro economic factors  a prolonged adverse change in the business climate  deteriorating market conditions and results of operations and a further decline in our stock price  we performed an interim impairment test as of september  on goodwill relating to our reporting units and broadcast licenses and other identifiable assets at individual television and radio stations 
we applied the interim impairment testing provisions in accordance with fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our interim impairment tests in the third quarter of indicated there was no goodwill impairment  however  four television broadcast licenses and radio broadcast licenses were impaired 
we recorded a million non cash impairment charge in the third quarter of we perform our annual impairment test on our indefinite lived intangible assets  including goodwill related to our reporting units and broadcast licenses and other identifiable assets at individual television and radio stations  as of the beginning of the fourth quarter 
since the third quarter interim impairment test was performed as of the end of the third quarter  the third quarter results were used to satisfy the annual testing requirement 
however  due to the continuation of the downturn in the economy that adversely impacted our fourth quarter operating results and caused us to significantly reduce our expected cash flows for and beyond  and further declines in the market value of our common stock  we performed an interim impairment test as of december  on goodwill relating to our reporting units and broadcast licenses and other identifiable assets at individual television and radio stations 
our interim impairment tests in the fourth quarter of indicated goodwill impairment due to a decline in our expected cash flows and further impairment of our television and radio broadcast licenses due to a decline in projected market revenues and increases in discount rates 
we recorded a million non cash impairment charge for goodwill at our publishing and broadcasting reporting units and a million non cash impairment charge for eight television broadcast licenses and radio broadcast licenses in the fourth quarter of for purposes of testing the carrying values of goodwill related to our reporting units  we determined fair value by using an income and a market valuation approach 
the income approach uses expected cash flows for each reporting unit 
the cash flows were then discounted for risk and time value 
in addition  the present value of the projected residual value was estimated and added to the present value of the cash flows 
the market approach was based on price multiples of publicly traded stocks of comparable companies to derive fair value 
each approach was weighted equally to determine a fair value estimate of each reporting unit 
we based our fair value estimates  in large measure  on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable 
however  actual future results may differ from those projections  and those differences may be material 
the valuation methodology used to estimate the fair value of our total company and our reporting units requires inputs and assumptions ie market growth  operating profit margins  and discount rates that reflect current market conditions as well as management judgment 
the current economic downturn has negatively impacted many of those inputs and assumptions 
if expected cash flows of our community newspapers and shoppers reporting unit continues to deteriorate and management concludes expected cash flows will not improve within a reasonable period of time  we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge in future periods  which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
for broadcast licenses at individual television and radio stations  we used an income approach to estimate fair value 
the fair value estimates of our broadcast licenses contain significant assumptions incorporating variables that are based on past experiences and judgments about future performance using industry normalized information for an average station within a market with the type of signal that each subject station produces 
these variables include  but are not limited to the forecasted growth rate of each market  including market population  household income and retail sales  market share and profit margins of an average station within a market  estimated capital expenditures and start up costs  risk adjusted discount rate  likely media competition within the market and expected growth rates into perpetuity to estimate terminal values 
adverse changes in significant assumptions such as an increase in discount rates or a decrease in projected market revenues could result in additional non cash impairment charges on our broadcast licenses in future periods  which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations

liquidity and capital resources cash balances were million at december  we believe our expected cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our credit facility will meet our needs for the next twelve months 
we have a million unsecured revolving facility that expires on june  the interest rate on borrowings is either libor plus a margin that ranges from basis points to basis points  depending on our leverage  or the base rate  which equals the higher of the prime rate set by us bank  us or the federal funds rate plus basis points 
as of december  and december   we had borrowings of million and million  respectively  under the facility at a weighted average rate of and  respectively 
the increase in our borrowings was primarily used for repurchases of our class a common stock in fees in connection with the facility of million are being amortized over the term of the facility using the straight line method which approximates the effective interest method 
this agreement includes the following two financial covenants a consolidated funded debt ratio of not greater than to  as determined for the four fiscal quarter periods preceding the date of determination 
this ratio compares  for any period  our funded debt to our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as adjusted for non operational impairment charges recorded as a result of fasb statement no

 goodwill and other intangible assets  to our interest expense

in such case  we may seek to amend or replace our current credit facility with one or more capital sources on appropriate terms 
if we were unable to remain in compliance with these covenants or to amend or replace our current facility on appropriate terms  we could face increased pressure to reduce or delay capital expenditures  further decrease dividend payments  dispose of assets or operations  further reduce the size of our workforce or take other steps to revise our capital structure or our business operations 
we cannot assure you that we will have the ability to take any of these actions or that these actions would be successful 
given the current economic crisis  including the current instability of financial institutions  one or more of the lenders in our credit facility syndicate could fail or be unable to fund future draws thereunder or take other positions adverse to us 
in such an event  our liquidity could be severely restrained with an adverse impact on our ability to operate our businesses and we may be forced to take the actions described above

in october  given the challenging economic environment  we suspended our share repurchase program 
we do not know how deeply this recession will impact our cash and earnings in  therefore  we believe the suspension will allow us to direct a significant portion of our cash flow to debt reduction 
cash flow continuing operations cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by accounts receivable collections 
cash used for investing activities was million in compared to cash provided by investing activities of million in capital expenditures were million in compared to million in our capital expenditures at our daily newspaper are primarily targeted towards equipment  building improvements and technology upgrades 
our capital expenditures in our broadcasting segment are targeted towards technology upgrades  including investments in television and radio digital infrastructure 
we believe these expenditures will help us to better serve our advertisers and viewers and to facilitate our cost control initiatives 
in  our capital expenditures are expected to be significantly less than the amount of capital expenditures in cash used for acquisitions was million in compared to million in our broadcast business acquired two television stations for million and our community newspapers and shoppers acquired several publications in northern wisconsin and florida for million

in and  we paid million and million  respectively  to purchase our class a and class b common stock 
we paid cash dividends of million and million in and  respectively 
discontinued operations cash used for discontinued operations was million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to million in estimated tax payments on the gains on the sales of norlight and the three regional publishing and printing operations of our community newspapers and shoppers business and a decrease in cash provided by the operations of norlight due to its sale in february capital expenditures  which related primarily to norlight  were million in contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  are summarized below 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years dollars in millions contractual obligations long term notes payable to banks pension and other postretirement benefits operating leases purchase commitments other liabilities total includes the associated interest calculated on our borrowings of million outstanding as of december  at a weighted average rate of 
for the pension and other postretirement benefits  payments included in the table have been actuarially estimated over a ten year period 
these payments are expected to be funded directly from company assets through while benefit payments under these benefit plans are expected to continue beyond  we believe that an estimate beyond this period is unreasonable 
our million unsecured revolving facility expires on june  as of december   we had borrowings outstanding of million under the facility 
we expect to make contributions to the qualified pension plan from company assets of million over a ten year period 
as of december   we expect to make payments over a ten year period for the non qualified pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan of million and million  respectively 
we lease office space  certain broadcasting facilities  distribution centers  buildings used for printing plants and equipment under both short term and long term leases accounted for as operating leases 
some of the lease agreements contain renewal options and rental escalation clauses  as well as provisions for the payment of utilities  maintenance and taxes 
we have a purchase commitment relating to printing equipment for our publishing business of approximately million as of december  purchase commitments related to audience research services and cellular phone services for our broadcasting business were approximately million as of december  over the next five years  we are committed to purchase million of television program rights that currently are not available for broadcast  including programs not yet produced 
if such programs are not produced  our corresponding commitment would expire without obligation 
other liabilities consist primarily of obligations for syndicated contracts  a national advertising representative litigation settlement  our unrecognized tax benefits  a capital lease  deferred income and deferred compensation arrangements 
as of december   our expected payment for significant contractual obligations includes approximately million of liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
we have reasonably estimated that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits will be settled as follows million will occur in one to three years  million will occur in three to five years  and million will occur in more than five years 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations  and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  capital resources  or significant components of revenues or expenses 
we do not rely on off balance sheet arrangements for liquidity  capital resources  market risk support  credit risk support or other benefits 
critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related footnote disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  property and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  litigation  and pension and other postretirement benefits 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we do not believe our past results have differed materially from these estimates  however  we cannot predict how actual results may differ from these estimates in the future 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and changes in our customer payment patterns and terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us such as bankruptcy filings  credit history  etc  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due us to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past loss history  the length of time the receivables are past due and the current business environment 
if our evaluations of the collectability of our accounts receivable differ from actual results  increases or decreases in bad debt expense and allowances may be required 
property and equipment and definite lived intangibles we assign useful lives for our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles based on our estimate of the amount of time that we will use those assets and we have selected the straight line method to depreciate our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles 
a change in the estimated useful lives or the depreciation or amortization method used could have a material impact upon our results of operations 
accounting standards require that  if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from an asset or group of assets  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
an evaluation of impairment of our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles was performed in no impairment resulted from this evaluation 
the estimated future cash flows related to an asset or group of assets is highly susceptible to change because we must make assumptions about future revenue and the related cost of sales 
changes in our assumptions could require us to recognize a loss for asset impairment in the future 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill and broadcast licenses accounted for and of total assets as of december  and december   respectively 
the annual impairment tests for goodwill and broadcast licenses under statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by factors including competitive industry valuations and long term interest rates that exist at the time the annual impairment tests are performed 
accordingly  we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under statement no 
to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  and to the extent that market values and long term interest rates in general decrease and increase  respectively 
for purposes of testing the carrying values of goodwill related to our reporting units  we determined fair value by using an income and a market valuation approach 
the income approach uses expected cash flows for each reporting unit 
the cash flows were then discounted for risk and time value 
in addition  the present value of the projected residual value was estimated and added to the present value of the cash flows 
the market approach was based on price multiples of publicly traded stocks of comparable companies to derive fair value 
each approach was weighted equally to determine a fair value estimate of each reporting unit 
we based our fair value estimates  in large measure  on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable 
however  actual future results may differ from those projections  and those differences may be material 
the valuation methodology used to estimate the fair value of our total company and our reporting units requires inputs and assumptions ie market growth  operating profit margins  and discount rates that reflect current market conditions as well as management judgment 
the current economic downturn has negatively impacted many of those inputs and assumptions 
if expected cash flows of our community newspapers and shoppers reporting unit continues to deteriorate and management concludes expected cash flows will not improve within a reasonable period of time  we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge in future periods  which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
for broadcast licenses at individual television and radio stations  we used an income approach to estimate fair value 
the fair value estimates of our broadcast licenses contain significant assumptions incorporating variables that are based on past experiences and judgments about future performance using industry normalized information for an average station within a market with the type of signal that each subject station produces 
these variables include  but are not limited to the forecasted growth rate of each market  including market population  household income and retail sales  market share and profit margins of an average station within a market  estimated capital expenditures and start up costs  risk adjusted discount rate  likely media competition within the market and expected growth rates into perpetuity to estimate terminal values 
adverse changes in significant assumptions such as an increase in discount rates or a decrease in projected market revenues could result in additional non cash impairment charges on our broadcast licenses in future periods  which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
accrued income taxes the internal revenue service irs and various state departments of revenue routinely examine our federal and state tax returns 
from time to time  the irs and the state departments of revenue may challenge certain of our tax positions 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law  and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged 
the final disposition of any positions challenged by the irs or state departments of revenue could require us to make additional tax payments or have an impact on our effective tax rate 
nonetheless  we believe that we have adequately reserved for any foreseeable payments related to such matters and consequently do not anticipate any material earnings impact from the ultimate resolution of such matters 
as of december  and december   we recorded liabilities for our unrecognized tax benefits of million and million  respectively 
we deduct broadcast licenses and tax deductible goodwill over a period of years from the date of acquisition 
the non cash goodwill and broadcast license impairment charges recorded during are not currently deductible for income tax purposes and have caused us to recognize deferred tax assets 
we have evaluated the realizability of our deferred tax assets and we believe that they will be utilized to offset future taxable income over the next years in accordance with current income tax law 
in the future  we may be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets if we have future operating losses or reductions in our expected future profitability which would cause us to believe we would be unable to utilize them 
accrued litigation we are subject to various legal actions  administrative proceedings and claims 
when necessary  we record a liability for an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of such claims 
the estimate would be developed in consultation with counsel and would be based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we believe that such unresolved legal actions and claims would not materially affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
employee benefits we are self insured for a majority of our employee related health and disability benefits and workers compensation claims 
third party administrators are used to process all claims 
liabilities for unpaid claims are based on our historical claims experience 
liabilities for workers compensation claims are developed from actuarial valuations 
actual amounts could vary significantly from such estimates which would require us to record additional expense in the future 
there are certain assumptions that have a significant effect on our obligations  such as the discount rate used to arrive at the net present value of the obligations and expense  the return on assets used to estimate the growth in invested asset value available to satisfy certain obligations  the salary increases used to calculate the impact future pay increases will have on pension obligations  and the employee turnover statistics used to estimate the number of employees to be paid pension benefits 
the assumptions used in accounting for pension benefits and other postretirement benefits for and are pension benefits other postretirement benefits discount rate for expense discount rate for obligations rate of compensation increases for expense rate of compensation increases for obligations expected return on plan assets for our pension plans  as of december   a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would have the following effects increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost components in effect on pension benefit obligation as of december  to determine the discount rate assumptions for the pension and the other postretirement benefit plans  we studied our plans specific discount rate by matching our projected benefit payments to a yield curve developed from high grade corporate bonds 
the results of those studies were used as the benchmark to determine the discount rate assumptions 
we study historical markets to determine the long term rate of return assumption for pension plan assets 
we preserved the long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income securities consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
we evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before we determine long term capital market assumptions 
we review peer data and historical returns to check for reasonability and appropriateness 
we make other assumptions that affect the accounting for pension benefits  such as the rate of compensation increase 
changes in these assumptions affect the benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the pension plan and the other postretirement plan and the required funding of the pension plan 
we review these assumptions on an annual basis 
the discount rate and medical cost inflation assumptions could have a significant effect on our other postretirement benefits obligations 
the discount rate is used to arrive at the net present value of the obligation 
the health care cost trend rate is used to calculate the impact future medical costs would have on postretirement obligations 
a one percent increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost components in less than less than effect on postretirement benefit obligation as of december  new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no
