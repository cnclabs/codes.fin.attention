in may  the state of texas enacted legislation replacing its franchise tax with a new margin tax 
despite an effective date of january   the enactment of the tax reform bill represents a change in tax law  and sfas  accounting for income taxes  requires that effects of the change must be reflected in the financial statements in the quarter in which the new tax is enacted 
as of december   the company expects to incur federal and state net operating losses of  these net operating losses can be carried forward to offset future taxable income  and will begin to expire in the years and if not utilized 
sfas  places a threshold for recognition of deferred tax assets based on whether it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
in making this determination  the company considers all positive and negative evidence  including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  projected taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial results 
based on the criteria established by sfas  the company established a valuation allowance of  against the deferred tax assets  as it is possible that a portion of the benefit resulting from these net operating loss carry forwards will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets of  which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of  and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of  as previously discussed  the valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
this allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets on certain net operating loss carry forwards 
the company will evaluate the ability to realize its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and adjusting the amount of such allowance if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s reversal of future deferred tax liabilities  available tax planning strategies and future taxable income

revenue recognition 
newspaper advertising revenue is recorded  net of agency commissions  when the advertisements are published in the newspaper

impairment of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets 
the company s intangible assets and goodwill result from its significant business acquisitions  which occurred prior to in connection with these acquisitions  the company obtained appraisals of the significant assets purchased 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired was recorded as goodwill 
at december   a 
h 
belo had net investments of  in property  plant and equipment   in goodwill  and  in intangible assets  which consist of subscriber lists 
the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by sfas  the company tests for goodwill annually at year end or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the required two step approach uses accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results 
changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
the company performs the impairment testing at its three newspaper operating units 
an impairment loss generally is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the 
table of contents reporting unit 
the estimates and judgments that most significantly affect the fair value calculation are assumptions related to revenue growth  newsprint prices  compensation levels  discount rate and private and public market trading multiples for newspaper assets 
see consolidated financial statements  note  for a discussion of the impairment charges taken 
as a result of the assessment as of december   the company incurred a non cash charge to goodwill of approximately  in the fourth quarter of related to impairment at the press enterprise

there is no tax effect related to the impairment charge  and this non cash charge will not affect the company s liquidity  cash flows from operating activities  debt covenants  or have any effect on future operations 
based on the assessments performed as of december   the company did not record any impairment charges related to goodwill or intangible assets 
the company reviews the carrying value of property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property and equipment is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to the future net cash flows the property and equipment is expected to generate 
based on assessments done during the year ended december   the company recorded an impairment loss related to a year old printing press of  based on assessments performed during the years ended december  and  the company did not record any impairment losses related to property  plant  and equipment

belo is involved in certain claims and litigation related to its operations 
in the opinion of management  liabilities  if any  arising from these claims and litigation would not have a material adverse effect on a 
h 
belo s consolidated financial position  liquidity  or results of operations 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters

belo  administer benefits for the belo and a 
h 
belo current and former employees who participate in the pension plan in accordance with the terms of the pension plan 
the distribution caused each a 
h 
belo employee to have a separation from service for purposes of commencing benefits under the pension plan at or after age as sponsor of the pension plan  belo will be solely responsible for satisfying the funding obligations with respect to the pension plan and retains sole discretion to determine the amount and timing of any contributions required to satisfy such funding obligations 
belo also retains the right  in its sole discretion  to terminate the pension plan 
a 
h 
belo will reimburse belo for percent of each contribution belo makes to the pension plan 
the company has recorded an accrual for the estimated future contributions to be paid to belo 
this estimate is based on input from the company s actuary of such contributions 
estimates of future contributions can change significantly based on assumptions required for funding of the pension plan 
significant assumptions include future interest rate levels  the amount and timing of asset returns  how current contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amounts and timing of future contributions and any changes to current law which would grant additional funding relief for defined benefit plan sponsors 
share based compensation 
the company records the compensation expense related to its stock options according to sfas r  as adopted on january  the company records the compensation expense related to its options using the fair value as of the date of grant as calculated using the black scholes merton method 
the company records the compensation expense related to its restricted stock units using the fair value as of the date of grant 
taxes 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the company also assesses the realizability of these deferred tax assets  and establishes a valuation allowance in accordance with sfas if the realizability threshold of more likely than not is not met 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax asset include reversal of future deferred tax liabilities  available tax planning strategies  and future taxable income 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and 
table of contents measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  any business combinations the company engages in will be recorded and disclosed following existing accounting principles until january  the company expects sfas r will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions  if any  that are consummated after the effective date 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
this statement permits entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the company has elected not to implement the fair value option with respect to existing assets or liabilities  therefore  the adoption of sfas had no effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas establishes  among other things  a framework for fair value measurements in the financial statements by providing a single definition of fair value  provides guidance on the methods used to estimate fair value  and increases disclosures about estimates of fair value 
sfas was effective for financial assets and liabilities in financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and is effective for non financial assets and liabilities in financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the company has adopted sfas but the adoption has not had a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   the company was not in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio as required by its credit facility 
during the fourth quarter of  the company s bank group approved an amendment and waiver to its credit facility 
on january   the company entered into the amended and restated credit agreement  which is more fully described in the financing cash flow discussion as well as in the consolidated financial statements note long term debt 
among other matters  the amended and restated credit agreement establishes minimum adjusted ebitda covenant requirements in compliance with the minimum adjusted ebitda and other financial covenants depends on the company s financial condition and results of operations  which are subject to a number of factors  including current and future economic conditions 
based on the company s projections for the remainder of fiscal year  which incorporate the company s assessment of current economic conditions  the projections currently indicate that the company will be able to meet these financial covenants throughout fiscal year these projections are based on revenue and expense estimates for the remainder of and include the implementation of continued expense savings initiatives  which are being implemented as well as other expense and revenue expectations for the remainder of fiscal year however  there can be no assurance of the company s ability to meet these financial covenants 
throughout and the beginning of  the economy has experienced disruptions resulting from the sub prime mortgage crisis and general credit market conditions in the united states 
the full extent that these disruptions will have on the company s results as well as their length and ultimate severity are difficult to predict 
should conditions worsen  or persist for an extended time  the company s results could be materially adversely affected 
due to the dynamic nature of assumptions used in estimating the company s financial results and the company s inability to control the effect of the current economic conditions  actual results may differ materially from the company s projections 
furthermore  the company s results may be affected by continued economic and political developments and those effects could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
if the current economic recession causes advertising revenues to decline more than currently anticipated  if other parts of our business experience adverse effects  or if our expense saving initiatives prove insufficient  then we may not be able to meet these financial covenants 
absent a waiver from the credit agreement lenders  not meeting these financial covenants will result in an event of default under the credit agreement 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  the credit agreement lenders could elect to terminate all commitments to extend further credit and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
the company s ability to borrow under the credit agreement depends on a borrowing base determined from a formula based on the levels of our accounts receivable and inventory 
if our accounts receivable and inventory are insufficient including  with respect to accounts receivable  as a result of decreased revenues  then we may be unable to borrow under the credit agreement notwithstanding compliance with the credit agreement s financial covenants
