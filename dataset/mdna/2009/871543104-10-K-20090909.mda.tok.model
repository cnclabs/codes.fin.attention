item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report on form k 
overview symmetricom is a leading supplier of precise timing standards to industry  government  utilities  research centers and aerospace markets 
we also supply qoe quality of experience solutions that enable communication service providers to monitor the performance  as perceived by end users  of ip based video and other next generation network applications 
timing and synchronization products and services include network synchronization systems and timing elements used by network operators and users  governments and professional services 
such products play an important role in the operation  bandwidth utilization  and quality of service of wireline  wireless and cable networks enabling our customers to increase the reliability of their networks in today s evolving communications environment 
symmetricom s customers include worldwide public network providers  incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs  public telephone and telegraph companies ptts  competitive local exchange carriers clecs  other telephone companies  wireless service providers  cable television operators  distributors and systems integrators  communications original equipment manufacturers oems  aerospace contractors  governments and research facilities 
our fiscal year is the or weeks ending on the sunday closest to june fiscal years through were week fiscal years 
fiscal year summary for the year ended june   symmetricom achieved revenues of million  up from the previous year  augmented by sales of our new cable timing product and continued strength in the timing  test and measurement business 
fiscal was a year of continuing innovation and progress in our growth investments and included measurable gains across many markets 
we are now the leading supplier of timing products to the cable market  and have fortified our position in evolving wireless  wireline  government and enterprise networks 
in fiscal we began to realize the benefits of our outsource manufacturing strategy as we completed the transfer of printed circuit board assemblies to our outsourcing vendor 
we made additional business model refinements during the year that further reduced costs in support of our near and long term profitability objectives 
our new product initiatives continued to show progress and promise with our cable timing product sales contributing meaningfully to gross margin 
sales of packetime  though still emerging  are gaining traction  with nearly a dozen carriers and oems now customers 
the chip scale atomic clock  which we believe will be an important long term growth driver for our timing  test and measurement business  continues to make appreciable progress toward volume production 
impairment of goodwill during the third quarter of fiscal  due to a decline in our stock price and a lowered business outlook  we determined that indicators of a potential goodwill impairment existed 
accordingly  we completed a step one goodwill impairment test to determine whether the decline in market capitalization and business outlook revisions indicated that the carrying value of our reporting units were in excess of fair value 
based on the results of our step one test  we determined that the fair values of the wireline and timing  test and measurement reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts  and therefore the second step of the goodwill impairment test was performed to measure the amount of impairment loss for each reporting unit 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million in the third quarter of fiscal  
table of contents consisting of million related to the wireline reporting segment and million related to the timing  test and measurement reporting segment 
restructuring during the second half of fiscal  we announced two restructuring plans to further streamline manufacturing operations and improve operational efficiencies 
as part of our ongoing outsourcing and operational efficiency program  we eliminated approximately positions  or about of our total workforce 
the reductions began in january and will be completed by the third quarter of fiscal we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately million in connection with the plans 
total restructuring charges are expected to include approximately million in accelerated depreciation charges and approximately million in one time termination benefits and other restructuring related charges 
total charges related to these two restructurings in fiscal were million  including million related to accelerated depreciation and million in one time termination benefits and other restructuring related charges 
upon completion  we expect the restructuring and other actions to reduce our annual manufacturing and operating costs by approximately million 
over the first nine months of fiscal  we expect to incur remaining integration and restructuring charges amounting to million  including approximately million in accelerated depreciation charges and approximately million in one time termination benefits and other restructuring related charges 
other on october   we announced justin spencer had been named as chief financial officer and executive vice president  effective september  on june   our president and chief executive officer  thomas w 
steipp  retired from symmetricom and resigned from our board of directors 
on july   we announced that david g 
c t had been named as president and chief executive officer  effective august  the board of directors has also appointed mr 
c t to the board of directors 
known trends and uncertainties impacting future results of operations global market and economic conditions financial markets in the us and abroad have experienced a severe downturn arising from a multitude of factors  including concerns about the systemic impact of inflation and deflation  geopolitical issues  adverse credit conditions  higher energy costs  lower corporate profits and capital spending  and declining real estate and mortgage markets  combined with volatile oil prices  decreased business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases cease  to provide funding to borrowers 
adverse economic conditions in the us and other markets in which we operate and into which we sell our products have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
if current economic conditions or the constrained credit environment continue  our customers may be unable to timely replace maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs on satisfactory terms or at all  resulting in adverse effects on our results of operations 
in addition  our customers may delay or reduce capital expenditures 
this could result in reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  additional excess and obsolete inventory  potential impairment charges related to our goodwill and intangible assets  gross margin deterioration  slower adoption of new technologies  increased price competition and supplier difficulties 

table of contents fiscal year outlook we believe our new product initiatives  an expanded geographic focus  and a more streamlined cost structure will enable us to continue to benefit from the modernization of communication networks worldwide and to capitalize on promising opportunities for growth in fiscal as communication service providers roll out next generation networks to keep up with rising traffic and demand  we expect sales of our sync equipment and investments in next generation timing products to contribute to our business and create opportunities for expansion 
government networks and systems are also evolving  driving the ongoing need for reliable sync and timing  and creating demand for innovative new products to support their changing needs 
we believe our timing  test  and measurement business is positioned to perform well in this environment 
while we will continue our focus on efficiency in fiscal  our primary efforts will be centered on maximizing existing opportunities and bringing to market innovative new products 
we also expect to identify and pursue potential new growth opportunities that leverage our strong technology platform and relationships 
we are mindful that we are still in an unpredictable economic environment and have limited visibility into our customers calendar capital spending plans 
we expect our fiscal revenue to have a seasonal pattern similar to prior years with stronger revenues in our fiscal second half as telecommunications and cable service providers release their capital budgets 
following the successful launch of our cable product  we now have the supply chain capabilities to meet market demand and expect revenue for this product to more closely reflect cable infrastructure spending seasonality 
profit is expected to be even more heavily weighted to the second half as we realize the full benefit of the cost reductions we announced in june critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical accounting estimates due to their subjective nature and judgments involved in each revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our standard arrangement for our domestic and international customers includes a signed purchase order or contract and no right of return of delivered products 
revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities 
we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral from our customers 
however  for many of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
if we determine that collection of the invoice is not reasonably assured  we recognize the revenue at the time that collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 

table of contents generally  product revenue is generated from the sale of synchronization and timing equipment with embedded software that is incidental to product functionality 
for instances where embedded software is more than incidental to product functionality  we account for the transactions in accordance with the rules applicable to software revenue recognition 
we commonly have transactions that involve sales of both product and services to our customers 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed provided collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for returns or credits under certain circumstances 
accordingly  we defer an estimate of returns from distributors based on a historical average of distributor returns 
we record commission expense both when orders are received and shipped  at which times the commission is both earned and payable 
revenue from contracts that require development and manufacture in accordance with customer specifications and have a lengthy development period may be categorized into two types firm fixed price and cost plus reimbursement 
revenue is recognized under the fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method cost to cost basis  principally based upon the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs at completion on the individual contracts 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
revenue recognized under cost plus contracts is recognized on the basis of direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of costs or as a performance based award fee 
revenue from long term contracts is reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an ongoing review of customer accounts  payment patterns and specific collection issues 
where specific collection issues are identified  we record a specific allowance based on the amount that we believe will be uncollected 
for accounts where specific collection issues are not identified  we record a reserve based on the age of the receivable and historical collection patterns 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts on a periodic basis 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value less costs to sell  if less than its cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand and technological obsolescence 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold 
warranty our standard warranty agreement is one year from shipment 
however  our warranty agreements are contract and component specific and can range to twenty years for selected components 
we offer extended warranty contracts on products that are less than eight years old 
the extended warranty contract is applicable for a maximum of nine years after the expiration of the standard one year warranty 
the revenue from extended warranty contracts is recognized ratably over the period of contract 
we accrue for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment 
our warranty reserve is based on the number of installed units  historical analysis of the volume of product returned to us under the warranty program  management s judgment regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and associated repair costs 
we use the historical data to forecast our anticipated future warranty obligations 
this analysis is updated on a quarterly basis 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we provide for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in the financial statements in the period that includes the enactment date 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  which are made up of tax deductions  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits  assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully realize these assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we do not generate sufficient future income  the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  resulting in an additional income tax expense 
a portion of our tax credits is related to stock options and has a valuation allowance because of uncertainty regarding their realization 
if these tax credits are realized  the benefit will be credited to common stock 
in fiscal  we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
short term investments short term investments consist of government securities  mutual funds and corporate debt securities that mature between three and months 
all of our short term investments  except the deferred compensation assets  are classified as available for sale 
during fiscal  we reclassified the deferred compensation assets from available for sale to trading securities in order to maintain consistency with the method in which we account for the deferred compensation obligations 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value with temporary unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as a component of stockholders equity 
unrealized gains and losses related to trading securities are included in earnings  net of taxes 
short term investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
we consult with our investment manager and consider available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments on a quarterly basis 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
during fiscal  we recorded million in losses related to short term investments 
see the liquidity and capital resources section below for additional information regarding this loss and our determination of the fair value of these investments at june  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb staff position fsp fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary 
table of contents impairments fsp fas 
fsp fas requires entities to separate an other than temporary impairment of a debt security into two components when there are credit related losses associated with an impaired debt security that management asserts it has no intent to sell  and it is more likely than not that management will not be required to sell the security before recovery of the security s cost basis 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to a credit loss is recognized in earnings  and the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to other factors is recorded in other comprehensive loss 
for fiscal  the adoption of fsp fas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
we engage an independent third party appraisal firm to assist us in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimations and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  and the brand awareness and the market position of the acquired products and assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
valuation of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test the carrying amount of goodwill annually during the fourth fiscal quarter as well as at other times if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  including goodwill 
during the third quarter of fiscal  due to a decline in our stock price and a lowered business outlook  we determined that indicators of a potential goodwill impairment existed 
accordingly  we completed a step one goodwill impairment test to determine whether the decline in market capitalization and business outlook revisions indicated that the carrying value of our reporting units were in excess of fair value 
a step one goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if a step two test is required 
we estimate our reporting unit s fair values using a weighted average of values determined under an income approach and a market approach 
we weighed these approaches at approximately and for the income approach and the market approach  respectively 
we applied a lower weighting to the market approach as there are a limited number of highly comparable companies  which are a key component of the market approach 
under the income approach  fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows 
the income approach is dependent on several significant assumptions  including our earnings projections and our cost of capital 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on pricing multiples of certain financial parameters observed in comparable companies 
based on the results of our step one test  we determined that the fair values of the wireline and timing  test and measurement reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts  and therefore the second step of the goodwill impairment test was performed to measure the amount of impairment loss for the each reporting unit 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million in the third quarter 
table of contents of fiscal  consisting of million related to the wireline reporting segment and million related to the timing  test and measurement reporting segment 
valuation of long lived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
intangible assets primarily include purchased technology and trademarks 
we review our intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if these criteria indicate that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
if an impairment charge were recognized  the amortization related to intangible assets would decrease during the remainder of the life of the asset 
in the third quarter of fiscal  because of the identification of goodwill impairment indicators see above valuation of goodwill  we first reviewed our other intangible and long lived assets for impairment and determined there was no impairment

table of contents key operating metrics key operating metrics for measuring our performance include sales backlog  contract revenue  headcount and deferred revenue 
these metrics  which compare fiscal year with fiscal year  are listed below 
sales backlog our backlog consists of firm orders that have yet to be shipped to the customer  or may not be shippable to a customer until a future period 
most orders included in backlog can be rescheduled or cancelled by customers without significant penalty 
historically  a substantial portion of net revenue in any fiscal period has been derived from orders received during that fiscal period 
our total backlog amounted to million as of june   compared to million as of june  the million reduction in backlog between june  and june  was primarily due to the ramp up in supply capacity at the end of fiscal to meet pent up demand for our new cable timing product 
our backlog  which is shippable within the next six months  was million as of june   compared to million as of june  contract revenue revenue from contracts that require development and manufacture in accordance with customer specifications and have a lengthy development period may be categorized into two types firm fixed price and cost plus reimbursement 
revenue is recognized under the fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  cost to cost basis principally based upon the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs at completion on the individual contracts 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
revenue recognized under cost plus contracts is recognized on the basis of direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of costs or as performance based award fee 
revenue from long term contracts is reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
as of june   we had approximately million in contract revenue to be performed and recognized within the next months  compared to approximately million in contract revenue that was to be performed and recognized within the following months as of june  these amounts have been accounted for as part of our sales backlog discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   working capital was million  compared to million as of june  cash and cash equivalents as of june  decreased million to million from million as of june  this decrease was primarily the result of the repayment of million of our convertible notes and a shift from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments 
short term investments increased from million as of june  to million as of june  net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million 
the net cash provided by operating activities was driven by the net loss of million  offset by non cash charges of million for impairment of goodwill  million of depreciation and amortization expenses  million of stock based compensation expense  million of provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  million for losses on short term investments  million for a loss on disposal of fixed assets  and a net million for other non cash adjustments to the net loss  for a total of million of operating cash inflows 
requirements for working capital assets and liabilities drove cash usage in operations of approximately million  comprised of a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventory  a million increase in prepaids and other assets  and a million reduction in accounts payable  partially offset by a million increase in accrued compensation and a million increase in other accrued liabilities 
the million net cash used for investing activities in fiscal was attributable to million in purchases of short term investments  partially offset by million in maturities of short term investments 
the million net cash used for financing activities was attributable to million used to repay a portion of our convertible notes  million used to repurchase common stock and million used to repay long term obligations 

table of contents our total capital spending commitments outstanding as of june  were approximately million 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days as of june   compared to days as of june  we believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating and working capital expenditure needs in the ordinary course of business for at least the next months and the foreseeable future 
we base our expense levels in part on our expectation of future revenue levels 
if our revenue for a particular period is lower than we expect  we may take steps to reduce our operating expenses accordingly 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements or if we require additional capital resources to grow our business or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses in the future  we may seek to issue additional equity securities or obtain additional debt financing 
additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
loss on short term investment  net in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we purchased asset backed commercial paper with a million par value maturing on march   and we classified this as a short term investment 
at the time of purchase  the investment s portfolio consisted primarily of triple a rated assets  with sub prime loan assets making up approximately of the investment 
subsequently  the structured investment vehicle siv issuing the commercial paper was declared insolvent and entered receivership 
on january   our investment manager advised us that the fair value of this investment had declined  and that the impairment loss should be considered other than temporary in accordance with discussions with the receiver as well as potential options that were expected to be made available to senior debt holders including symmetricom 
our investment manager determined the fair value of the investment using pricing levels of the underlying portfolio by three different broker dealers 
management then made an independent valuation assessment of similar securities using the abx index which is an index to track the performance of mortgage backed securities  to confirm that the valuation results from our investment manager were reasonable 
based on this assessment of fair value  symmetricom recognized a loss of million related to this investment during fiscal year after the receivers sold the siv to an investment bank  we received a cash distribution of million  relating to the cash portion of the fund  in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  the investment bank offered investors the option of cashing out of the fund or reinvesting in a new investment vehicle 
we elected to cash out and received a final capital distribution of million in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the final settlement with this investment  including a recovery on previously recognized losses  we recognized a million gain in the first quarter of fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we determined that three corporate debt instruments  the market values of which had declined  were other than temporarily impaired 
we made this determination based on the uncertainty and volatility of the market  particularly since these debt instruments were related to financial institutions  the failure of several other large financial institutions and the continued downgrades from credit rating agencies 
as a result of this assessment  we recognized a million other than temporary loss in the first quarter of fiscal this amount was partially offset by the previously mentioned million gain  resulting in net loss on short term investments of million for the first quarter of fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we determined that mutual funds related to our deferred compensation plan  whose market values had declined  were other than temporarily impaired 
we made this determination based on the overall decline in the value of the mutual funds and the uncertainty as to whether they would recover 
as a result of this assessment  we recognized a million other than temporary loss in the second quarter of fiscal

fsp fas requires entities to separate an other than temporary impairment of a debt security into two components when there are credit related losses associated with an impaired debt security that management asserts it has no intent to sell  and it is more likely than not that management will not be required to sell the security before recovery of the security s cost basis

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure as of june   we had short term investments of million 
these investments are mainly in government agency and corporate debt securities that have maturity dates of greater than three months 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk in as much as their fair value will fall if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels prevailing at june   the fair value of the portfolio would not decline by a material amount 
additionally  a decrease in the market interest rates would not materially impact the fair value of the portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks inherent in these securities 
however  we do attempt to reduce these risks by typically limiting the maturity date of such securities to no more than months  placing our investments with high credit quality issuers and limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
the possibility exists that some of these issues may be downgraded as a result of disruptions in the credit market  however  we believe that we currently have the ability and currently intend to hold these investments until maturity  and therefore  believe that reductions in the value of these securities attributable to short term fluctuations in interest rates would not materially harm our business 
on june   we issued convertible subordinated notes with a fixed rate of  which have no interest rate risk impact to our business 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates relates primarily to the intercompany balances with our subsidiaries in the united kingdom and germany 
although we transact business in various countries  settlement amounts are usually based on united states currency 
transaction gains or losses have not been significant in the past and we do not presently engage in hedging activity 
a hypothetical adverse change in sterling or euro against united states dollars would not result in a material foreign exchange loss 
consequently  we do not expect that a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have a direct material impact on our business 
notwithstanding the foregoing analysis of the direct effects of interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations on the value of certain of our investments and accounts  the indirect effects of such fluctuations could have a materially harmful effect on our business 
for example  international demand for our products is affected by foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect the buying patterns of our customers 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations have broad influence on the general condition of the united states  foreign and global economies which could materially harm our business
