item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture and sell versatile and high performance video products and system solutions that enable service providers to efficiently deliver the next generation of broadcast and on demand services  including high definition television  or hdtv  video on demand  or vod  network personal video recording and time shifted tv 
historically  the majority of our sales have been derived from sales of video processing solutions and edge and access systems to cable television operators and from sales of video processing solutions to direct to home satellite operators 
we also provide our video processing solutions to telecommunications companies  or telcos  broadcasters and internet companies that offer video services to their customers 
harmonic s net sales increased by in from  and increased by in from the increase in sales in compared to was primarily due to stronger demand from our domestic and international satellite operators and our domestic cable operators  and sales of our recently introduced products 
we also experienced an improved gross margin percentage in compared to primarily due to higher gross margins from new products and an increase in the proportion of net sales from software  which has higher margins that our hardware products 
our operating results in included a charge of million for the settlement of a patent litigation lawsuit 
we also recognized a benefit from income taxes of million resulting from the use of net operating loss carryforwards and the release of the substantial majority of our income tax valuation allowance 
the increase in sales in compared to was primarily due to stronger demand from our domestic and international satellite operators and our domestic cable operators  and sales of our recently introduced products 
we also experienced an improved gross margin percentage in compared to due to higher gross margins from new products and an increase in the proportion of net sales from software  which has higher margins than our hardware products 
in addition  in we continued to reduce our sales of fiber to the premises  or fttp  products which have significantly lower gross margins than our other products 
our operating results for also included a charge of million for the expected settlement of the securities class action lawsuit and a net credit of million consisting of a million credit from a revised estimate of expected sublease income due to the extension of a sublease of a building to the lease expiration which was partially offset by a charge of million from a change in sublease income for a sunnyvale building and a charge of million from the closure of the manufacturing and research and development activities of broadcast technology ltd 
we believe that the improvement in the industry capital spending environment that was experienced in  and has been  in part  a result of the intense competition between cable and satellite operators to offer more channels of digital video and new services  such as vod and hdtv  and in part the result of the entry of telephone companies into the business of delivering video services to their subscribers 
we also believe that the improvement has been due to more favorable conditions in industry capital markets during and and the completion or resolution of certain major business combinations  financial restructurings and regulatory issues 
adverse economic conditions in markets in which we operate and into which we sell our products can harm our business 
recently  economic conditions in the countries in which we operate and sell products have become increasingly negative  and global financial markets have experienced a severe downturn stemming from a multitude of factors  including adverse credit conditions impacted by the subprime mortgage crisis  slower economic activity  concerns about inflation and deflation  increased energy costs  decreased consumer confidence  rapid changes in foreign exchange rates  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns and other factors 
economic growth in the us and in many other countries slowed in the fourth quarter of  remained slow during  and is expected to slow further or recede in in the us and internationally 
during challenging economic times  and in tight credit markets  many customers may delay or reduce capital expenditures 
this could result in reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles  difficulties in collection of accounts receivable  excess and obsolete inventory  gross margin deterioration  slower adoption of new technologies  increased price competition and supplier difficulties 
for example  we believe that the recent global economic 
table of contents slowdown caused certain customers to reduce or delay capital spending plans in the fourth quarter of  and expect that these conditions could persist well into in addition  during challenging economic times  we are likely to experience increased price based competition from our competitors  which may result in our losing sales or force us to reduce the prices of our products  which would reduce our revenues and could adversely affect our gross margin 
historically  a majority of our net sales have been to relatively few customers  and due in part to the consolidation of ownership of cable television and direct broadcast satellite systems  we expect this customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future 
in  sales to comcast and echostar accounted for and of net sales  respectively 
in  sales to comcast and echostar accounted for and of net sales  respectively 
sales to comcast accounted for of net sales in sales to customers outside of the us in   and represented   and of net sales  respectively 
a significant portion of international sales are made to distributors and system integrators  which are generally responsible for importing the products and providing installation and technical support and service to customers within their territory 
sales denominated in foreign currencies were approximately  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
we expect international sales to continue to account for a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future  and expect that  following the completion of the proposed acquisition of scopus  our international sales may increase 
harmonic often recognizes a significant portion  or the majority  of its revenues in the last month of the quarter 
harmonic establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of harmonic s business is derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  the timing of such orders  delays in project completion and revenue recognition policies can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
harmonic s expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations  our operating results may be adversely impacted by our inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
in addition  because a significant portion of harmonic s business is derived from orders placed by a limited number of customers  the timing of such orders can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
on december   harmonic entered into a definitive agreement to acquire scopus video networks ltd  a publicly traded company organized under the laws of israel 
under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  harmonic will pay per share in cash  without interest  for all of the outstanding ordinary shares of scopus  which represents an enterprise value of approximately million  net of scopus cash and short term investments 
the acquisition of scopus is expected to extend harmonic s worldwide customer base and strengthen its market and technology leadership  particularly in international video broadcast  contribution and distribution markets 
the merger is expected to close in march on december   harmonic completed its acquisition of entone technologies  inc pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  or entone agreement  dated august   for a total purchase consideration of million 
the purchase consideration consisted of a payment of million  the issuance of  shares of harmonic common stock with a value of million  issuance of  options to purchase harmonic common stock with a value of million and acquisition related costs of million 
under the terms of the entone agreement  entone spun off its consumer premises equipment  or cpe  business into a separate private company prior to the closing of the merger 
as part of the terms of the entone agreement  harmonic purchased a convertible note with a face amount of million in the new spun off private company in july the convertible note was sold to a third party for approximately million during on july   harmonic completed its acquisition of rhozet corporation  pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  or rhozet agreement  dated july  under the rhozet agreement  harmonic paid or will pay an aggregate of approximately million in total merger consideration  comprised of approximately million in cash   shares of harmonic s common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of rhozet  and approximately million of cash which was paid in the first quarter of  as provided in the rhozet agreement  to the holders of outstanding options to acquire rhozet common stock 
in addition  in connection with the acquisition  harmonic incurred approximately million in transaction costs 
pursuant to the rhozet agreement  approximately million of the total merger consideration  consisting of cash and shares of harmonic common stock  are being held back by harmonic for at least months following the closing of the acquisition to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of rhozet s shareholders pursuant to the terms of the rhozet agreement 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  we sold and issued  shares of common stock in a public offering at a price of per share 
our net proceeds from the offering were approximately million  which was net of underwriters discounts and commissions of approximately million and related legal  accounting  printing and other costs totaling approximately million 
the net proceeds from the offering have been and are expected to continue to be used for general corporate purposes  including payment of existing liabilities  research and development  the development or acquisition of new products or technologies  equipment acquisitions  strategic acquisitions of businesses  general working capital and operating expenses 
in the third quarter of  we completed our facilities rationalization plan resulting in more efficient use of our sunnyvale campus and vacated several buildings  some of which were subsequently subleased 
this resulted in a net charge for excess facilities of million in the third quarter of in the third quarter of  we recorded a credit of million from a revised estimate of expected sublease income due to the extension of a sublease of a sunnyvale building to the lease expiration 
in addition  in we recorded a restructuring charge of million on a reduction in estimated sublease income for a sunnyvale building  and a charge of million from the closure of the manufacturing and research and development activities of broadcast technology limited 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a charge in selling  general and administrative expenses for excess facilities of million from a revised estimate of expected sublease income of a sunnyvale building 
the lease for such building terminates in september and all sublease income has been eliminated from the estimated liability 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a charge in selling  general and administrative expenses for excess facilities of million from a revised estimate of expected sublease income of two buildings in the united kingdom 
the leases for these buildings terminate in october and all sublease income has been eliminated from the estimated liability 
we are in the process of expanding our international operations and staff to better support our expansion into international markets 
this expansion includes the implementation of an international structure that includes  among other things  an international support center in europe  a research and development cost sharing arrangement  certain licenses and other contractual arrangements by and among the company and its wholly owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries 
our foreign subsidiaries have acquired certain rights to sell our existing intellectual property and intellectual property that will be developed or licensed in the future 
as a result of these changes and an expanding customer base internationally  we expect that an increasing percentage of our consolidated pre tax income will be derived from  and reinvested in  our international operations 
we anticipate that this pre tax income will be subject to foreign tax at relatively lower tax rates when compared to the united states federal statutory tax rate in future periods 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures requires harmonic to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and expenses if different judgments or different estimates were made

revenue recognition harmonic s principal sources of revenue are from sales of hardware products  software products  solution sales  services and hardware and software maintenance agreements 
harmonic recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and risk of loss and title have transferred to the customer 
we generally use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
we evaluate our products to assess whether software is more than incidental to a product 
when we conclude that software is more than incidental to a product  we account for the product as a software product 
revenue on software products and software related elements are recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
significant judgment may be required in determining whether a product is a software or hardware product 
revenue from hardware product sales is recognized in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
subject to other revenue recognition provisions  revenue on product sales is recognized when risk of loss and title has transferred  which is generally upon shipment or delivery  based on the terms of the arrangement 
revenue on shipments to distributors  resellers and systems integrators is generally recognized on delivery or sell in 
allowances are provided for estimated returns and discounts 
such allowances are adjusted periodically to reflect actual and anticipated experience 
distributors and systems integrators purchase our products for specific capital equipment projects of the end user and do not hold inventory 
they perform functions that include importation  delivery to the end customer  installation or integration  and post sales service and support 
our agreements with these distributors and systems integrators have terms which are generally consistent with the standard terms and conditions for the sale of our equipment to end users and do not provide for product rotation or pricing allowances  as are typically found in agreements with stocking distributors 
we have long term relationships with most of these distributors and systems integrators and substantial experience with similar sales of similar products 
we do have instances of accepting product returns from distributors and system integrators 
however such returns typically occur in instances where the system integrator has designed a component into a project for the end user but the integrator requests to return product that does not meet the specific project s functional requirements 
such returns are made solely at the discretion of the company  as our agreements with distributors and system integrators do not provide for return rights 
we have had extensive experience monitoring product returns from our distributors and accordingly  we have concluded that the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exits  and sab with respect to these sales  we evaluate the terms of sale and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and risk of loss and title have transferred 
when arrangements contain multiple elements  harmonic evaluates all deliverables in the arrangement at the outset of the arrangement based on the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
if the undelivered elements qualify as separate units of accounting based on the criteria in eitf  which include that the delivered elements have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and that objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for undelivered elements  harmonic allocates the arrangement fee based on the relative fair value of the elements of the arrangement 
if a delivered element does not meet the criteria in eitf to be considered a separate unit of accounting  revenue is deferred until the undelivered elements are fulfilled 
we establish fair value by reference to the price the customer is required to pay when an item is sold separately using contractually stated  substantive renewal rates  when applicable  or the average price of recently completed stand alone sales transactions 
accordingly  the determination as to whether appropriate objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists can impact the timing of revenue recognition for an arrangement 

table of contents for multiple element arrangements that include both hardware products and software products  harmonic evaluates the arrangement based on eitf  applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software 
in accordance with the provisions of eitf  the arrangement is divided between software related elements and non software deliverables 
software related elements are accounted for as software 
software related elements include all non software deliverables for which a software deliverable is essential to its functionality 
when software arrangements contain multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  harmonic accounts for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by sop no 
in arrangements where vsoe of fair value is not available for all undelivered elements  we defer the recognition of all revenue until all elements  except post contract support  have been delivered 
fair value of software related elements is based on separate sales to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in contracts when the quoted renewal rates are deemed to be substantive 
we also enter into solution sales for the design  manufacture  test  integration and installation of products to the specifications of harmonic s customers  including equipment acquired from third parties to be integrated with harmonic s products 
these arrangements typically include the configuration of system interfaces between harmonic product and customer third party equipment  and optimization of the overall solution to operate with the unique features of the customer s design and to meet customer specific performance requirements 
revenue on these arrangements is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction production contracts 
we measure performance under the percentage of completion method using the efforts expended method based on current estimates of labor hours to complete the project 
management believes that for each such project  labor hours expended in proportion to total estimated hours at completion represents the most reliable and meaningful measure for determining a project s progress toward completion 
if the estimated costs to complete a project exceed the total contract amount  indicating a loss  the entire anticipated loss is recognized 
deferred revenue includes billings in excess of revenue recognized  net of deferred costs of sales 
our application of percentage of completion accounting is subject to our estimates of labor hours to complete each project 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results  financial position or cash flows for a particular period could be adversely affected 
during the year ended december   we recorded a loss of approximately million related to a loss contract 
revenue from hardware and software maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement 
first year maintenance typically is included in the original arrangement and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
services revenue is recognized on performance of the services and costs associated with services are recognized as incurred 
fair value of services such as consulting and training is based upon separate sales of these services 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determination of the revenue to be recognized in any accounting period 
because of the concentrated nature of our customer base  different judgments or estimates made for any one large contract or customer could result in material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized in any particular period 
allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts we establish allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts based on credit profiles of our customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions and historical payment  return and discount experience  as well as for known or expected events 
if there were to be a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness or if actual defaults  returns or discounts were higher than our historical experience  our operating results  financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected 
at december   our allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts totaled million 
valuation of inventories harmonic states inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we write down the cost of excess or obsolete inventory to net realizable value based on future demand forecasts and historical demand 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to record additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
inventory management is of critical importance in order to balance the need 
table of contents to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
impairment of goodwill or long lived assets we perform an evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill and long lived assets  such as intangibles  on an annual basis in the fourth quarter  or whenever we become aware of an event or change in circumstances that would indicate potential impairment 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill on the basis of market capitalization adjusted for a control premium and discounted cash flows on a company level  which is the sole reporting unit 
we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and other long lived assets on the basis of undiscounted cash flows from each asset group 
if impairment is indicated  provisions for impairment are determined based on fair value  principally using discounted cash flows 
for example  changes in industry and market conditions or the strategic realignment of our resources could result in an impairment of identified intangibles  goodwill or long lived assets 
there can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
our review of intangibles in determined that the remaining balance of million of the intangibles acquired as a result of the btl acquisition in february had been impaired based on the discontinuance of the decoder product line obtained in the acquisition 
at december   our carrying values for goodwill and intangible assets totaled million and million  respectively 
restructuring costs and accruals for excess facilities for restructuring activities initiated prior to december  harmonic recorded restructuring costs when it committed to an exit plan and significant changes to the exit plan were not likely 
harmonic determines the excess facilities accrual based on estimates of expected cash payments reduced by any sublease rental income for each excess facility 
in the event that harmonic is unable to achieve expected levels of sublease rental income  it will need to revise its estimate of the liability which could materially impact our operating results  financial position or cash flows 
for restructuring activities initiated after december   harmonic adopted sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
at december   our accrual for excess facilities totaled million 
assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation harmonic records accruals for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
based on an agreement entered into on january  to settle its outstanding patent infringement litigation  harmonic believed that a probable and estimable liability had been incurred  and  accordingly  recorded a provision for million in its statement of operations for the year ended december  based on a preliminary agreement to settle its outstanding securities litigation  harmonic believed that a probable and estimable liability had been incurred  and  accordingly  recorded a provision for million in its statement of operations for the year ended december  in other pending litigation  harmonic believes that it either has meritorious defenses with respect to those actions and claims or is unable to predict the impact of an adverse action and  accordingly  no loss contingencies have been accrued 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will prevail 
an unfavorable outcome of these legal proceedings or failure to settle the securities litigation on the terms proposed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  operating results or cash flows 
accounting for income taxes in preparation of our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current tax exposures and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
during the year ended december   a full release of the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions  based on our 
table of contents judgment that the likelihood that our deferred tax assets in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions will be recovered from future taxable income is more likely than not  resulted in a benefit from income taxes of million recorded in the company s consolidated statement of operations and a million reduction in goodwill 
we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities on a periodic basis 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin as of the beginning of prior to adoption  our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
the effects of final resolution  if any  were recognized as changes to the effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
fin requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions 
if the recognition threshold is met  fin permits us to recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is more than percent likely to be realized upon settlement 
it further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change 
we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position  we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome 
we adjust these reserves and penalties as well as the related interest  in light of changing facts and circumstances 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
the changes in estimate could have a material impact on our financial position and operating results 
in addition  settlement of any particular position could have a material and adverse effect on our cash flows and financial position 
stock based compensation on january   harmonic adopted statement of financial accounting standards r  share based payment  sfas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan espp based upon the grant date fair value of those awards 
sfas r supersedes the company s previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations  and provided the required pro forma disclosures prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for stock based compensation  sfas as amended 
in addition  we have applied the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab  issued by the securities and exchange commission  in our adoption of sfas r 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of the company s fiscal year stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively  which consisted of stock based compensation expense related to employee equity awards and employee stock purchases 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
stock based compensation expense recognized in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december   and included compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas and compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  the company changed its method of attributing the value of stock based compensation costs to expense from the accelerated multiple option method to the straight line single option method 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted on or prior to 
table of contents december  will continue to be recognized using the accelerated approach while compensation expense for all share based payment awards related to stock options and employee stock purchase rights granted subsequent to december  are recognized using the straight line method 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in our results for the years ended december   and is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the fair value of share based payment awards is estimated at grant date using a black scholes option pricing model 
the company s determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the company s stock price as well as the assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
on november   the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards  fsp r 
we elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fsp r for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method provides a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
the adoption of fsp r did not have an impact on our overall consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
consistent with prior years  we use the with and without approach as described in eitf topic no 
d in determining the order in which our tax attributes are utilized 
the with and without approach results in the recognition of the windfall stock option tax benefits only after all other tax attributes of ours have been considered in the annual tax accrual computation 
also consistent with prior years  we consider the indirect effects of the windfall deduction on the computation of other tax attributes  such as the r d credit and the domestic production activities deduction  as an additional component of equity 
this incremental tax effect is recorded to additional paid in capital when realized

the increase in marketing expenses was primarily related to trade shows

the difference between the underlying effective tax rate for the year ended december  and the federal statutory rate of is primarily attributable to charges due to the differential in foreign tax rates as well as non deductible stock based compensation expense  offset by benefits due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  and the release of the valuation allowance 
in accordance with sfas  we have evaluated the need for a valuation allowance based on historical evidence  trends in profitability  expectations of future taxable income and implemented tax planning strategies 
as such  we determined that a valuation allowance was no longer necessary for our us and certain foreign deferred tax assets because  based on the available evidence  we concluded that a realization of these net deferred tax assets was more likely than not 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance for certain foreign deferred tax assets at the end of a release of the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions resulted in a credit of million to our consolidated statement of operations and a million reduction in goodwill for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes in is principally due to federal alternative minimum tax and foreign income taxes 
segments effective january   harmonic implemented a new organizational structure  and we have operated as a single operating segment and reported our financial results as a single segment since that time

liquidity and capital resources fiscal year ended december  in thousands  except percentages cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  compared to million as of december  cash provided by operations was million in  resulting from net income of million  adjusted for million in non cash charges and a million net change in assets and liabilities 
the 
table of contents non cash charges included deferred income taxes  stock based compensation  depreciation  amortization  other non cash adjustments and loss on disposal of fixed assets 
the net change in assets and liabilities included an increase in income taxes payable  lower inventories and accounts receivables  which was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable primarily from the payment for inventory purchases  a decrease in accrued excess facilities costs and a decrease in deferred revenue 
to the extent that non cash items increase or decrease our future operating results  there will be no corresponding impact on our cash flows 
after excluding the effects of these non cash charges  the primary changes in cash flows relating to operating activities resulted from changes in working capital 
our primary source of operating cash flows is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers 
our operating cash flows are also impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable and other liabilities 
we generally pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with the invoice terms and conditions 
in addition  we usually pay our annual incentive compensation to employees in the first quarter 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  resulting primarily from the net purchase of investments of million  the payment of million of capital expenditure primarily for test equipment and a payment of million to option holders of rhozet as part of the acquisition in july  which was partially offset by the sale to a third party of a convertible note from entone  inc for million 
harmonic currently expects capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million during net cash provided by financing activities was million in  resulting primarily from proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the sale of our common stock under our purchase plan 
under the terms of the merger agreement with c cube  harmonic is generally liable for c cube s pre merger tax liabilities 
approximately million of pre merger tax liabilities remained outstanding at december  and are included in accrued liabilities 
these liabilities represent estimates of c cube s pre merger tax obligations to various tax authorities in five countries 
we are working with lsi logic  which acquired the spun off semiconductor business in june and assumed its obligations  to settle these obligations  a process which has been underway since the merger in harmonic paid million during  but is unable to predict when the remaining obligations will be paid  or in what amount 
the full amount of the estimated obligation has been classified as a current liability 
to the extent that these obligations are finally settled for less than the amounts provided  harmonic is required  under the terms of the tax sharing agreement  to refund the difference to lsi logic 
conversely  if the settlements are more than the remaining million pre merger tax liability balance lsi is obligated to reimburse harmonic 
harmonic has a bank line of credit facility with silicon valley bank  which provides for borrowings of up to million that matures on march  as of december   other than standby letters of credit and guarantees  there were no amounts outstanding under the line of credit facility and there were no borrowings in or this facility  which was amended and restated in march  contains a financial covenant with the requirement for harmonic to maintain cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  net of credit extensions  of not less than million 
if harmonic is unable to maintain this cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance or satisfy the affirmative covenant requirement  harmonic would be in noncompliance with the facility 
in the event of noncompliance by harmonic with the financial covenants under the facility  silicon valley bank would be entitled to exercise its remedies under the facility which include declaring all obligations immediately due and payable if obligations were not repaid 
at december   harmonic was in compliance with the covenants under this line of credit facility 
the march amendment requires payment of approximately  of additional fees if the company does not maintain an unrestricted deposit of million with the bank 
future borrowings pursuant to the line bear interest at the bank s prime rate at december  
borrowings are payable monthly and are not collateralized 
harmonic s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were million 
as of december   we held approximately million of auction rate securities  or arss  classified as short term investments and the fair value of these securities approximate their par value at the balance sheet date 
these arss which are invested in preferred securities in closed end mutual funds  all have a credit rating of aa or better and the issuers are paying interest at the maximum contractual rate 
during  the company was able to sell million of arss through successful auctions and redemptions 
the remaining balance of million in arss that we held as of december   all had failed auctions in during august  we received notification from our investment manager who holds the arss that it had reached a settlement with certain regulatory authorities  pursuant to which the company would be able to sell its outstanding arss to the investment manager at par  plus accrued interest and dividends at any time during the period from january  through january  the entire balance of million in arss that we held at december  were sold at par plus interest in february 
table of contents in the event we need or desire to access funds from the other short term investments that we hold  it is possible that we may not be able to do so due to adverse market conditions 
our inability to sell all or some of our short term investments at par or our cost  or rating downgrades of issuers of these securities  could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
nevertheless  we believe that our existing liquidity sources will satisfy our requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  if our expectations are incorrect  we may need to raise additional funds to fund our operations  to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or to strengthen our financial position 
on december   harmonic entered into a definitive agreement to acquire scopus video networks ltd  a publicly traded company organized under the laws of israel 
under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  harmonic will pay per share in cash  without interest  for all of the outstanding ordinary shares of scopus  which represents an enterprise value of approximately million  net of scopus cash and short term investments 
the merger is expected to close in march in addition  we actively review potential acquisitions that would complement our existing product offerings  enhance our technical capabilities or expand our marketing and sales presence 
any future transaction of this nature could require potentially significant amounts of capital or could require us to issue our stock and dilute existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to harmonic  as well as factors beyond our control  including the global economic slowdown  market uncertainty surrounding the ongoing us war on terrorism  as well as conditions in financial markets and the cable and satellite industries 
there can be no assurance that any financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements none as of december  
table of contents contractual obligations and commitments future payments under contractual obligations  and other commercial commitments  as of december   were as follows payments due by period total amounts committed year or less years years over years in thousands contractual obligations operating leases inventory purchase commitment c cube pre merger tax liabilities rhozet outstanding purchase consideration patent litigation settlement foreign currency forward exchange contracts total contractual obligations other commercial commitments standby letters of credit indemnification obligations guarantees total commercial commitments operating lease commitments include million of accrued excess facilities costs 
harmonic indemnifies its officers and the members of its board of directors pursuant to its bylaws and contractual indemnity agreements 
harmonic also indemnifies some of its suppliers and customers for specified intellectual property rights pursuant to certain parameters and restrictions 
the scope of these indemnities varies  but in some instances  includes indemnification for damages and expenses including reasonable attorneys fees 
there have been no claims for indemnification and  accordingly  no amounts have been accrued in respect of the indemnification provisions at december  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits classified as income tax payable long term in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december   have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the operating results  financial position  or liquidity of harmonic due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
harmonic is exposed to market risk because of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and currencies of harmonic s subsidiaries  and changes in the value of financial instruments held by harmonic 
foreign currency exchange risk harmonic has a number of international subsidiaries each of whose sales are generally denominated in us dollars 
in addition  harmonic has various international branch offices that provide sales support and systems integration services 
sales denominated in foreign currencies were approximately of net sales in and of net sales in periodically  harmonic enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts to manage exposure related to accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
harmonic does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
at december   we had a forward exchange contract to sell euros totaling million that matures within the first quarter of while harmonic does not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on harmonic s operating results  financial position and liquidity  harmonic cannot assure you that a sudden and significant change in the value of local currencies would not harm harmonic s operating results  financial position and liquidity 
interest rate and credit risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to harmonic s investment portfolio of marketable debt securities of various issuers  types and maturities and to harmonic s borrowings under its bank line of credit facility 
harmonic does not use derivative instruments in its investment portfolio  and its investment portfolio only includes highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of less than two years 
these investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at estimated fair value  with material unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
as of december   we had gross unrealized losses of million that were determined by management to be temporary in nature 
if the credit market continues to deteriorate  we may conclude that the decline in value is other than temporary and we may also incur realized losses  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
there is risk that losses could be incurred if harmonic were to sell any of its securities prior to stated maturity 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance was million 
in a declining interest rate environment  as short term investments mature  reinvestment occurs at less favorable market rates 
given the short term nature of certain investments declining interest rates would negatively impact investment income 
based on our estimates  a basis point  or  change in interest rates would have increased or decreased the fair value of our investments by approximately million
