litigation and settlements various legal proceedings or claims  including litigation claiming that lung cancer and other diseases  as well as addiction  have resulted from the use of  or exposure to  rai s operating subsidiaries products  and seeking damages in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars  are pending or may be instituted against rjr tobacco  the conwood companies or their affiliates  including rai or rjr  or indemnitees  including b w 
for further discussion of the litigation and legal proceedings pending against rai or its affiliates or indemnitees  see item  note to consolidated financial statements 
rai s management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against rjr tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees  or the loss of any particular claim concerning the use of smokeless tobacco against the conwood companies  when viewed on an individual basis  is not probable 
rai and its subsidiaries believe that they have valid basis for appeal of adverse verdicts against them and have valid defenses to all actions and intend to defend all actions vigorously 
nonetheless  the possibility of material losses related to tobacco litigation is more than remote 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and generally it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against rjr tobacco  the conwood companies or their affiliates or indemnitees  or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss 
moreover  notwithstanding the quality of defenses available to it and its affiliates in tobacco related litigation matters  it is possible that rai s consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position could be materially adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of certain pending or future litigation matters 
employees at december   rai and its subsidiaries had approximately  full time employees and approximately part time employees 
the  full time employees include approximately  rjr tobacco employees and  conwood employees 
no employees of rai or its subsidiaries are unionized 
item a 
risk factors rai and its subsidiaries operate with certain known risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
the risks below are not the only ones rai and its subsidiaries face 
additional risks not currently known or currently considered immaterial also could affect rai s business 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors in connection with other information included in this annual report of form k 

table of contents rai s operating subsidiaries could be subject to substantial liabilities and bonding difficulties from litigation related to cigarette products or smokeless tobacco products  thereby reducing operating margins and cash flows from operations 
adverse litigation outcomes could have a negative impact on rai s ability to continue to operate due to their impact on cash flows 
rjr tobacco  the conwood companies and their affiliates  including rai  and indemnitees  including b w  have been named in a large number of tobacco related legal actions  proceedings or claims 
the claimants seek recovery on a variety of legal theories  including negligence  strict liability in tort  design defect  fraud  misrepresentation  unfair trade practices and violations of state and federal antitrust laws 
various forms of relief are sought  including compensatory and  where available  punitive damages in amounts ranging in some cases into the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars 
the tobacco related legal actions range from individual lawsuits to class actions and other aggregate claim lawsuits 
in particular  class action suits have been filed in a number of states against individual cigarette manufacturers  including rjr tobacco  alleging that the use of the terms lights and ultra lights constitutes unfair and deceptive trade practices 
many of these lights cases were stayed pending review of the good v 
altria group  inc case by the us supreme court 
on december   the us supreme court decided that these claims are not preempted by the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act or by the us federal trade commission s  referred to as ftc  historic regulation of the industry 
in light of this decision  it is likely that the stayed cases will be activated  additional cases may go to trial  new cases will be filed and defense costs will increase 
in the event rjr tobacco and its affiliates and indemnitees lose one or more of the pending lights class action suits  rjr tobacco  depending upon the amount of any damages ordered  could face difficulties in obtaining the bond required to stay execution of the judgment 
for a more complete description of these cases  see class action suits lights cases in item  note to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  in engle v 
rj reynolds tobacco co  et al 
circuit court  dade county  florida  filed may   the florida supreme court issued a ruling that  among other things  determined that the case could not proceed further as a class action 
the ruling also permitted members of the engle class to file individual claims  including claims for punitive damages  through january  rjr tobacco refers to these cases as the engle progeny cases 
although the final number of engle progeny cases is not yet known  rjr tobacco has been served in  cases on behalf of approximately  plaintiffs 
the engle progeny cases will result in increased litigation activity  including an increased number of trials in  and increased expenses 
for a more complete description of the engle progeny cases  see engle progeny cases in item  note to consolidated financial statements 
it is likely that similar legal actions  proceedings and claims arising out of the sale  distribution  manufacture  development  advertising  marketing and claimed health effects of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products will continue to be filed against rjr tobacco  the conwood companies  or their affiliates and indemnitees and other tobacco companies for the foreseeable future 
victories by plaintiffs in highly publicized cases against rjr tobacco and other tobacco companies regarding the health effects of smoking may stimulate further claims 
a material increase in the number of pending claims could significantly increase defense costs 
in addition  adverse outcomes in pending cases could have adverse effects on the ability of rjr tobacco and its indemnitees  including b w  to prevail in other smoking and health litigation

as a result of the order issued in a case brought by the us department of justice  rjr tobacco could be subject to additional  substantial marketing restrictions  which would negatively impact revenue  increase related compliance costs and reduce operating margins of rjr tobacco  and  consequently of rai 
in september  the us department of justice brought an action against rjr tobacco  b w and other tobacco companies 
the government sought  in addition to other remedies  pursuant to the civil provisions of rico  disgorgement of profits the government contends were earned as a consequence of a rico racketeering 
table of contents enterprise 
in august  the court found certain defendants  including rjr tobacco  liable for the rico claims  but did not impose any direct financial penalties 
instead  the court  among other things  enjoined the defendants from committing future racketeering acts  participating in certain trade organizations  making misrepresentations concerning smoking and health and youth marketing  and using certain brand descriptors such as low tar  light  ultra light  mild and natural  and ordered the defendants to issue corrective communications on five subjects  including smoking and health  and addiction 
both sides have appealed 
in october  the us court of appeals granted the defendants motion to stay pending the outcome of the defendants appeal 
oral argument occurred on october  a decision is pending 
rjr tobacco does not know the timing of an appellate decision or  if the order is affirmed  the compliance deadlines that will be imposed 
if the order is affirmed without modification  then rjr tobacco believes that certain provisions of the order would have adverse business effects on the marketing of rjr tobacco s current product portfolio and that such effects could be material 
also  if the order is affirmed  then rjr tobacco would incur costs in connection with complying with the order  such as the costs of corrective communications 
for a more complete description of this case  see health care cost recovery cases department of justice case in item  note to consolidated financial statements 
rjr tobacco s overall retail market share of cigarettes has declined in recent years and is expected to continue to decline  if rjr tobacco is not able to continue to grow market share of its growth brands  or develop  produce or market new alternative tobacco products profitably  results of operations  cash flows and financial position of rjr tobacco and consequently  of rai could be adversely impacted 
rjr tobacco s us retail market share of cigarettes has been declining for a number of years  and rjr tobacco expects this market share to continue to decline 
according to data from iri  rjr tobacco s share of the us cigarette retail market declined to in from in  continuing a trend in effect for several years 
if rjr tobacco s growth brands do not continue to grow market share  results of operations  cash flows and financial position will be adversely affected 
in addition  consumer health concerns  changes in adult consumer preferences and changes in regulations require or cause rjr tobacco to introduce new alternative tobacco products 
consumer acceptance of new products  such as camel snus or camel dissolvables  may not be achieved 
furthermore  rjr tobacco may not find vendors willing to produce alternative tobacco products resulting in additional capital expenditures for rjr tobacco 
rjr tobacco is dependent on the us cigarette market  which it expects to continue to decline  negatively impacting revenue 
the international rights to substantially all of rjr tobacco s brands were sold in to jti 
in addition  in connection with the b w business combination in  rai entered into a non competition agreement with bat under which rai s operating subsidiaries generally are prohibited  subject to certain exceptions  from manufacturing and marketing certain tobacco products outside the united states until july therefore  rjr tobacco is dependent on the us cigarette market 
price increases  restrictions on advertising and promotions  funding of smoking prevention campaigns  increases in regulation and excise taxes  health concerns  a decline in the social acceptability of smoking  increased pressure from anti tobacco groups and other factors have reduced us cigarette consumption 
us cigarette consumption is expected to continue to decline 
rjr tobacco is rai s largest operating segment 
as such  it is the primary source of rai s revenue  operating income and cash flows 
rjr tobacco s contract manufacturing agreements with bat may end in rjr tobacco s contract manufacturing for bat accounted for of total rai sales and approximately of total rjr tobacco cigarette production in these contract manufacturing agreements may expire at the end of if bat s contracts are not renewed or extended  rjr tobacco s revenue  operating income and cash flows will be unfavorably impacted 

table of contents rai s operating subsidiaries are subject to significant limitations on advertising and marketing of tobacco products  which could harm the value of their existing brands or their ability to launch new brands  thus negatively impacting revenue 
in the united states  television and radio advertisements of cigarettes have been prohibited since  and television and radio advertisements of smokeless tobacco products have been prohibited since under the msa  certain of rai s operating subsidiaries  including rjr tobacco  cannot use billboard advertising  cartoon characters  sponsorship of certain events  non tobacco merchandise bearing their brand names and various other advertising and marketing techniques 
in addition  the msa prohibits targeting of youth in advertising  promotion or marketing of tobacco products  including the smokeless tobacco products of rjr tobacco 
the conwood companies are not participants in the msa 
although these restrictions were intended to ensure that tobacco advertising was not aimed at young people  some of the restrictions also may limit the ability of rai s operating subsidiaries to communicate with adult tobacco users 
additional restrictions may be imposed legislatively or agreed to in the future 
recent proposals have included limiting tobacco advertising to black and white  text only advertisements 
similar to the potential us food and drug administration  referred to as the fda  restrictions described below  these limitations may make it difficult to maintain the value of existing brands or brand styles  and could significantly impair the ability of rai s operating subsidiaries to launch new brand styles 
in the us  tobacco products are subject to substantial and increasing regulation and taxation  which has a negative effect on revenue and profitability 
tobacco products are subject to substantial federal and state excise taxes in the united states 
on february   president obama signed an increase of in the federal excise tax per pack of cigarettes  for a total of per pack of cigarettes  and significant tax increases on other tobacco products  to fund expansion of the state children s health insurance program  referred to as the schip 
these tax increases are effective on april  under the schip  the tax rate for chewing tobacco will increase per pound to per pound and will increase per pound to per pound for snuff 
the federal tax on small cigars  defined as those weighing three pounds or less per thousand  will increase per thousand to per thousand 
large cigars currently are taxed at a rate of of the manufacturer s price  with a cap of per thousand 
under the schip  the rate on large cigars will increase to of the manufacturer s price with a maximum rate of per cigar 
in addition  the tax rate for roll your own tobacco will increase from per pound to per pound 
the increases in federal excise tax under the schip are substantial  and  as a result  rai expects its operating subsidiaries volume will be adversely impacted beginning in the second quarter of in addition to federal and state excise taxes  certain city and county governments also impose substantial excise taxes on tobacco products sold 
increased excise taxes are likely to result in declines in overall sales volume and shifts by consumers to less expensive brands 
a wide variety of federal  state and local laws limit the advertising  sale and use of cigarettes  and these laws have proliferated in recent years 
for example  many local laws prohibit smoking in restaurants and other public places 
private businesses also have adopted regulations that prohibit or restrict  or are intended to discourage  smoking 
such laws and regulations also are likely to result in a decline in the overall sales volume of cigarettes 
for additional information on the issues described above  see governmental activity in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item the proposed regulation of tobacco products by the food and drug administration may adversely affect rai s sales and operating profit 
a bill that would grant the fda  authority to regulate tobacco products was introduced in congress in february on july   the us house of representatives passed the bill by a vote of the us senate health  education  labor and pensions committee approved the fda regulation bill on august   but the senate adjourned in without any further action on the bill 
in  it is likely that congress will again take up the issue of fda regulation of tobacco products 

table of contents it is anticipated that any proposed fda regulation bill most likely would require larger and more severe health warnings on packs and cartons  ban the use of descriptors on tobacco products  such as low tar and light  require the disclosure of ingredients and additives to consumers  require pre market approval by the fda for claims made with respect to reduced risk or reduced exposure products  allow the fda to require the reduction of nicotine and the reduction or elimination of any other compound in tobacco products  prohibit the use of foreign grown tobacco that has been grown or processed with pesticides not approved under federal law for use in domestic tobacco farming and processing  allow the fda to place more severe restrictions on the advertising  marketing and sale of cigarettes  permit inconsistent state regulation of labeling and advertising and eliminate the existing federal preemption of such regulation  and grant the fda the regulatory authority to impose broad additional restrictions 
it is possible that such additional regulation could result in a decrease in cigarette and smokeless tobacco sales in the united states  including sales of rjr tobacco s and conwood s brands  and an increase in costs to rjr tobacco and conwood which may have a material adverse effect on rai s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
rai believes that such regulation may adversely affect the ability of its operating subsidiaries to compete against its larger competitors  including philip morris usa  inc  who may be able to more quickly and cost effectively comply with these new rules and regulations 
over the years  various state and local governments have continued to regulate tobacco products  including smokeless tobacco products 
these regulations relate to  among other things  the imposition of significantly higher taxes  increases in the minimum age to purchase tobacco products  sampling and advertising bans or restrictions  ingredient and constituent disclosure requirements and significant tobacco control media campaigns 
additional state and local legislative and regulatory actions will likely be considered in the future  including  among other things  restrictions on the use of flavorings 
additional federal or state regulation relating to the manufacture  sale  distribution  advertising  labeling  mandatory ingredients disclosure and nicotine yield information disclosure of tobacco products could reduce sales  increase costs and have a material adverse effect on the business of the operating subsidiaries of rai 
for additional information on the issues described above  see governmental activity in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item rjr tobacco s and conwood s volumes  market share and profitability may be adversely affected by competitive actions and pricing pressures in the marketplace 
the tobacco industry is highly competitive 
among the major manufacturers  brands primarily compete on product quality  price  brand recognition  brand imagery and packaging 
substantial marketing support  merchandising display  discounting  promotions and other financial incentives generally are required to maintain or improve a brand s market position or introduce a new brand 
in addition  substantial payment obligations under the msa adversely affect rjr tobacco s ability to compete with manufacturers of deep discount cigarettes that are not subject to such substantial obligations 
for a more complete description of the msa  see health care recovery cases msa in item  note to consolidated financial statements 
conwood s largest competitor  ust inc  was acquired by the parent company of philip morris usa  inc in january this acquisition of ust inc may change the competitive dynamics by combining pricing and merchandising display for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products 
pricing pressure and limited merchandising 
table of contents display could adversely affect conwood s and rjr tobacco s market share  which would adversely affect rai s profitability and revenues 
increases in commodity prices will increase costs and may reduce profitability 
increases in the cost of tobacco leaf  other raw materials and other commodities used in rai s operating subsidiaries products could cause profits to decline 
certain of rai s operating subsidiaries may be required to write down intangible assets or goodwill due to impairment  thus reducing operating profit 
rai conducts an impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets at least once a year  or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset may not be recoverable 
during  rjr tobacco repositioned its kool brand as a support brand from a growth brand  which resulted in an impairment charge of million and an additional million impairment charge was incurred during the annual testing of rjr tobacco s brands 
conwood recorded an impairment of million related to kodiak  as well as multiple loose leaf and little cigar brands  as a result of annual impairment testing 
for more information on intangible asset impairment  see item  note to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the recent passage of the schip increases the federal excise tax on cigarettes by per pack and significantly increases the federal tax on other tobacco products 
these tax increases are effective april   and rai s operating subsidiaries expect the tax increases to significantly and adversely impact sales volume 
rai s operating subsidiaries believe that the federal excise tax increase is an event that will require that their goodwill and trademarks be tested for impairment during the first quarter of  and the resulting fair value of certain of their trademarks could be less than their carrying value 
in particular  rjr tobacco believes that impairment charges related to support and non support cigarette brands are possible  and conwood also believes that impairment charges related to certain brands are possible 
no reasonable estimate of trademark impairment charges can be made at this time by rai s operating subsidiaries 
changes in financial market conditions could result in higher costs and decreased profitability 
changes in financial market conditions could negatively impact rai s foreign currency exchange rate risk  interest rate risk and the return on corporate cash  thus increasing costs and reducing profitability 
during  adverse conditions in the financial markets forced rai to invest excess cash in either low interest funds or near zero interest funds  thereby  lowering interest income 
adverse changes in liquidity in the financial markets could result in additional realized or unrealized losses on investments 
continued adverse changes in the liquidity in the financial markets could result in additional realized or unrealized losses associated with the value of rai s investments  which would negatively impact rai s consolidated results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
during  rai recorded million of impairment losses from declines in the value of short term and long term investments 
as of december   million of unrealized losses remain in other comprehensive income loss 
for more information on investment losses  see item  note to consolidated financial statements 
rai s access to cash could be impacted by adverse changes in the financial markets and bankruptcy of financial institutions 
during  lehman commercial paper inc  referred to as lcpi  filed for protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code 
lcpi is a lender in rai s fifth amended and restated credit agreement  which as subsequently amended  is referred to as the credit facility 
there can be no assurance that lcpi would loan lcpi s pro rata share of any borrowing requests made by rai 
for more information on participants in rai s credit facility  see liquidity and financial condition in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item in addition  the adverse conditions in the financial markets during  caused rai to invest primarily in treasury money market funds 
if there were a high demand for cash from the treasury money market funds  restrictions could be placed on the funds  preventing immediate withdrawal and rai s access to needed cash 

table of contents increases in the cost of pension benefits or pension funding may reduce rai s profitability and cash flow 
rai s profitability is affected by the costs of pension benefits available to employees generally hired prior to january  adverse changes in investment returns earned on pension assets and discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities or changes in required pension funding levels may have an unfavorable impact on pension expense and cash flows 
due to adverse changes in the financial markets  rai s rate of return in on pension assets was negative 
this unfavorable return  along with an unfavorable discount rate  will increase rai s required pension funding for to a minimum of million and increase pension expense approximately million in rai actively seeks to control increases in pension costs  but there can be no assurance that profitability will not be adversely affected 
in addition  changes to pension legislation or changes in pension accounting may adversely affect profitability 
rjr tobacco relies on outside suppliers to manage certain non core business processes 
any interruption in these services could negatively affect the operations of rjr tobacco and harm its reputation and consequently the operations and reputation of rai 
in an effort to gain cost efficiencies  rjr tobacco has either outsourced or is in the process of outsourcing many of its non core business processes 
non core business process functions include  but are not limited to  information technology  human resources  trucking and facilities 
if any of the suppliers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at a satisfactory quality level  rjr tobacco may fail to operate effectively and fail to meet shipment demand 
rai s operating subsidiaries rely on a limited number of suppliers for direct materials 
an interruption in service from any of these suppliers could adversely affect the results of operations  cash flows and financial position of rai 
rai s operating subsidiaries rely on a limited number of suppliers for direct materials 
if a supplier fails to meet any of rai s operating subsidiary s demand for direct materials  the operating subsidiary may fail to operate effectively and may fail to meet shipment demand  adversely impacting rai s results of operations 
certain of rai s operating subsidiaries face a customer concentration risk 
the loss of this customer would result in a decline in revenue and have an adverse effect on cash flows 
revenues from mclane company  inc  a distributor  comprised of rai s consolidated revenues in the loss of this customer  or a significant decline in its purchases  could have a material adverse effect on revenue of rai 
fire  violent weather conditions and other disasters may adversely affect the operations of rai s operating subsidiaries 
a major fire  violent weather conditions or other disasters that affect manufacturing and other facilities of rai s operating subsidiaries  or of their suppliers and vendors  could have a material adverse effect on the operations of rai s operating subsidiaries 
despite rai s insurance coverage for some of these events  a prolonged interruption in the manufacturing operations of rai s operating subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on the ability of its operating subsidiaries to effectively operate their businesses 
the agreement relating to rai s credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit the flexibility of rai and its subsidiaries 
breach of those covenants will result in a default under the agreement relating to the facility 
restrictions in the agreement relating to rai s credit facility limit the ability of rai and its subsidiaries to obtain future financing  and could impact the ability to withstand a future downturn in their businesses or the economy in general  conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise 
in addition  if rai does not comply with these covenants  any indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility could become immediately due and payable 
the lenders under rai s credit facility could refuse to lend funds if rai is not in compliance with the covenants or could terminate the credit facility 
if rai were unable to repay accelerated amounts  the lenders under rai s credit facility could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation proceeding 

table of contents for more information on the restrictive covenants in rai s credit facility  see item  note to consolidated financial statements 
rai has substantial long term debt  which could adversely affect its financial position and its ability to obtain financing in the future and react to changes in its business 
because rai has debt of billion its ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements or general corporate purposes  and its ability to satisfy its obligations with respect to its indebtedness  may be impaired in the future  a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available to it for other purposes  it may be at a disadvantage compared to its competitors with less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates  and its flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited  and it may be more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions or its business  or be unable to carry out capital spending that is necessary or important to its growth strategy and its efforts to improve operating margins 
it is likely that rai will refinance  or attempt to refinance  a significant portion of this indebtedness prior to its maturity through the incurrence of new indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that rai s available cash or access to financing on acceptable terms will be sufficient to satisfy such indebtedness 
the ability of rai to access the debt capital markets could be impaired if the credit rating of its debt securities falls below investment grade 
the outstanding notes issued by rai and rjr are rated investment grade 
in certain cases  if rai s credit rating falls below investment grade  rai and certain of rai s subsidiaries  including its material domestic subsidiaries  referred to as the guarantors  will be required to provide collateral to secure rai s credit facility and senior notes 
in such event  rai may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in such amounts  at the times  at the lower interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if its debt was rated investment grade 
in addition  future debt security issuances or other borrowings may be subject to further negative terms  including limitations on indebtedness or similar restrictive covenants 
rai s credit ratings are influenced by some important factors not entirely within the control of rai or its affiliates  such as tobacco litigation  the regulatory environment and the performance of suppliers and vendors to rai s operating subsidiaries 
moreover  because the kinds of events and contingencies that may impair rai s credit ratings and the ability of rai and its affiliates to access the debt capital markets are often the same kinds of events and contingencies that could cause rai and its affiliates to seek to raise additional capital on an urgent basis  rai and its affiliates may not be able to issue debt securities or borrow money upon acceptable terms  or at all  at the times at which they may most need additional capital

b w s significant equity interest in rai could be determinative in matters submitted to a vote by rai shareholders  resulting in rai taking actions that rai s other shareholders do not support 
b w also has influence over rai by virtue of the governance agreement  which requires b w s approval before rai takes certain actions 
b w owns approximately of the outstanding shares of rai common stock 
only one other stockholder owns more than of the outstanding shares of rai common stock 
unless substantially all of rai s public shareholders vote together on matters presented to rai shareholders  b w would have the power to determine the outcome of matters submitted to a shareholder vote 

table of contents moreover  in connection with the b w business combination  rai  b w and bat entered into an agreement  referred to as the governance agreement  relating to various aspects of rai s corporate governance 
under the governance agreement  the approval of b w  as a rai shareholder  is required in connection with  among other things  the following matters the sale or transfer of certain rai intellectual property associated with b w brands having an international presence  other than in connection with a sale of rai  rai s adoption of any takeover defense measures that would apply to the acquisition of equity securities of rai by b w or its affiliates  other than the adoption of the rai rights plan  and rai s participation in any transaction  effected before july   that would reasonably be expected to jeopardize b w s tax ruling obtained in connection with  or b w s tax free treatment of  the b w business combination 
such influence could result in rai taking actions that rai s other shareholders do not support 
under the governance agreement  b w is entitled to nominate certain persons to rai s board  and the approvals of the majority of such persons is required before certain actions may be taken  even though such persons represent less than a majority of the entire board 
in addition  certain provisions of rai s articles of incorporation may create conflicts of interest between rai and certain of these persons 
under the governance agreement  b w  based upon its current equity stake in rai  is entitled to nominate five directors to rai s board  at least three of whom are required to be independent directors and two of whom may be executive officers of bat or any of its subsidiaries 
rai s board currently is comprised of persons  including b w s five designees 
matters requiring the approval of rai s board generally require the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting 
under the governance agreement  however  the approval of a majority of b w s designees on rai s board is required in connection with the following matters any issuance of rai securities in excess of of its outstanding voting stock  unless at such time b w s ownership interest in rai is less than  and any repurchase of rai common stock  subject to a number of exceptions  unless at such time b w s ownership interest in rai is less than 
as a result  b w s designees on rai s board may prevent the foregoing transactions from being effected  notwithstanding a majority of the entire board may have voted to approve such transactions 
under rai s articles of incorporation  a b w designated director who is affiliated with  or employed by  bat or its subsidiaries and affiliates is not required to present a transaction  relationship  arrangement or other opportunity  all of which are collectively referred to as a business opportunity  to rai if that business opportunity does not relate primarily to the united states 
b w s significant ownership interest in rai  and rai s shareholder rights plan  classified board of directors and other anti takeover defenses could deter acquisition proposals and make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of rai without the cooperation of b w 
this could have a negative effect on the price of rai s common stock 
as rai s largest shareholder  b w could vote its shares of rai common stock against any takeover proposal submitted for shareholder approval or refuse to accept any tender offer for shares of rai common stock 
this right would make it very difficult for a third party to acquire rai without b w consent 
in addition  rai has a shareholder rights plan  a classified board of directors and other takeover defenses in its articles of incorporation and bylaws 
b w s ownership interest in rai and these defenses could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of rai 
these deterrents could adversely affect the price of rai common stock and make it very difficult to remove or replace members of the board of directors or management of rai without cooperation of b w 

table of contents rai shareholders may be adversely affected by the expiration of the standstill and transfer restrictions in the governance agreement  which would enable b w to  among other things  transfer all or a significant percentage of its rai shares to a third party  seek additional representation on the rai board of directors  replace existing rai directors  solicit proxies or otherwise acquire effective control of rai 
the standstill provisions contained in the governance agreement generally restrict b w from acquiring additional shares of rai common stock and taking other specified actions as a shareholder of rai 
these restrictions generally will expire upon the earlier of ten years from the date of the b w business combination and the date on which a significant transaction  as defined in the governance agreement  is consummated or occurs 
subject to the terms of the rai shareholder rights plan  b w will be free after expiration of the standstill period to increase its ownership interest in rai to more than and may use this controlling vote to elect any number of or all the members of rai s board of directors 
in addition  if the transfer restrictions in the governance agreement are terminated  subject to the terms of the rai shareholder rights plan  there will be no contractual restrictions on b w s ability to sell or transfer its shares of rai common stock on the open market  in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
these sales or transfers could create a substantial decline in the price of shares of rai common stock or  if these sales or transfers were made to a single buyer or group of buyers that own rai shares  could result in a third party acquiring effective control of rai
