there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the policies management considers most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are the following revenue recognition twin disc recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title 
while we respect the customer s right to return products that were shipped in error  historical experience shows those types of adjustments 
table of contents have been immaterial and thus no provision is made 
with respect to other revenue recognition issues  management has concluded that its policies are appropriate and in accordance with the guidance provided by the securities and exchange commissions staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
accounts receivable twin disc performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjusts credit limits based on payment history and the customer s credit worthiness as determined by review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues 
in addition  senior management reviews the accounts receivable aging on a monthly basis to determine if any receivable balances may be uncollectible 
although our accounts receivable are dispersed among a large customer base  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of our largest customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost has been determined by the last in  first out lifo method for the majority of the inventories located in the united states  and by the first in  first out fifo method for all other inventories 
management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage  forecasted production based on future orders  demand forecasts  and economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
the adjustments to the reserve are estimates that could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from the actual requirements if future economic conditions  customer demand or competitive conditions differ from expectations 
goodwill in conformity with us gaap  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment might exist 
the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units using a fair value method based on management s judgments and assumptions or third party valuations 
the company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
the impairment testing performed by the company at june  indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying value  including goodwill and as such  no impairment existed at that time 
while the company believes its judgments and assumptions were reasonable  different assumptions  economic factors and or market indicators could change the estimated fair values of the company s reporting units and  therefore  impairment charges could be required in the future 
warranty twin disc engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers 
however  its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the extent of the market affected by the failure and the expense involved in satisfactorily addressing the situation 
the warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for warranty costs  management takes into consideration the term of the warranty coverage  historical claim rates and costs of repair  knowledge of the type and volume of new products and economic trends 
while we believe the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable in the future could differ materially from what actually transpires 

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefit plans the company provides a wide range of benefits to employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement health care coverage 
plan assets and obligations are recorded annually based on the company s measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  expected return on plan assets  compensation increases  retirement and mortality tables  and health care cost trend rates as of that date 
the approach used to determine the annual assumptions are as follows discount rate based on the hewitt top quartile yield curve at june  as applied to the expected payouts from the pension plans 
this yield curve is made up of corporate bonds rated aa or better 
expected return on plan assets based on the expected long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds  which is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers historical returns earned on the funds 
compensation increase reflect the long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
retirement and mortality rates based upon the generational mortality table for fiscal and  and the up mortality table for any prior years presented 
health care cost trend rates developed based upon historical cost data  near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
measurements of net periodic benefit cost are based on the assumptions used for the previous year end measurements of assets and obligations 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods 
based on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources  the company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable  however  changes in these assumptions could impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
