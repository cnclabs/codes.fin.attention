item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  above 
investments we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non marketable equity securities 
our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program 
under our strategic investment program  from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us 
the fair value of our portfolio of available for sale marketable equity securities  which are included in short term investments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  was million as of january  and million as of december  while we actively monitor these investments  we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect to these equity investments 
accordingly  we could lose all or part of our investment portfolio of marketable equity securities if there is an adverse change in the market prices of the companies we invest in 

table of contents our investments in non marketable equity securities would be negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market prices  although the impact cannot be directly quantified 
such a change  or any negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the companies whose non marketable securities we own  would harm the ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings  acquisitions and private sales 
these types of investments involve a high degree of risk  and there can be no assurance that any company we invest in will grow or will be successful or that we will be able to liquidate a particular investment when desired 
accordingly  we could lose all or part of our investment 
our investments in non marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of million as of january  and million as of december  if we determine that an other than temporary decline in fair value exists for a non marketable equity security  we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related write down as an investment loss in our consolidated statements of operations
