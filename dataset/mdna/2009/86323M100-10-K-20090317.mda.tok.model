critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of consolidated condensed financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires the appropriate application of accounting policies  many of which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated condensed financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results may differ from estimates 
such differences may be material to the consolidated condensed financial statements 

table of contents equipment and fixtures equipment and fixtures are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
furniture and fixtures are depreciated over a five year life  software over a three to five year life and equipment generally over a three to five year life 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the remaining term of the associated lease 
assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease 
amortization expense is computed using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease and is recorded in depreciation and amortization expense 
repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
the carrying value of equipment and fixtures to be held and used is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
an asset is considered to be impaired when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition does not exceed its carrying amount 
the amount of the impairment loss  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value  which is generally determined based on appraisals or sales prices of comparable assets 
occasionally  we redeploy equipment and fixtures from underutilized centers to other locations to improve capacity utilization if it is determined that the related undiscounted future cash flows in the underutilized centers would not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of these assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas no 
 goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that an asset might be impaired 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
we operate in one reporting unit  which is the basis for impairment testing and the allocation of acquired goodwill 
intangible assets with a finite life are recorded at cost and amortized using their projected cash flows over their estimated useful life 
client lists and relationships are amortized over ten and one half years  market adjustments related to facility leases are amortized over the term of the respective lease and developed software is amortized over five years 
brands and trademarks are not amortized as their life is indefinite 
in accordance with sfas  indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the carrying value of intangibles is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets

stock based compensation at december   we had a stock based compensation plan for employees and directors 
we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  at our inception 
for share based payments  the fair value of each grant  including both the time based grants and the performance based grants  is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option 
table of contents valuation model and assumes the performance goals will be achieved 
if such goals are not met  no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized cost is reversed 
stock compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting term  net of an estimated future forfeiture rate 
the forfeiture rate assumption as of december  is based on the predecessor s historical experience 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred assets and liabilities for the future income tax consequence of transactions that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes  and the amounts used for income tax  using the enacted tax rates for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets whenever we believe it is more likely than not  based on available evidence  that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin at our inception 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and requires the impact of a tax position to be recognized in the financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained by the taxing authority 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas no 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to permit entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the fasb s objective in this statement is to provide reporting entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we adopted sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal year the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flow  as we did not elect this fair value option on any financial assets or liabilities 
in december  the fasb issued fas no 
r  business combinations  or fas r 
fas r replaces fasb statement no 
 business combinations fas 
fas r retains the fundamental requirements in fas that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations  that an acquirer be identified for each business combination and for goodwill to be recognized and measured as a residual 
fas r expands the definition of transactions and events that qualify as business combinations to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses 
fas r broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and interests transferred as a result of business combinations 
fas r also increases the disclosure requirements for business combinations in the financial statements 
fas r is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  therefore  we are required to adopt fas r on january  adoption of fas r will not impact our accounting for business combinations closed prior to its adoption  but given the nature of the changes noted above  we expect our accounting for business combinations occurring subsequent to adoption will be significantly different than that applied following current accounting literature 
in december  the fasb issued fas no 
 non controlling interest in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 or fas fas requires that a non controlling interest in a subsidiary be separately reported within equity and the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the non controlling interest be presented in the statement of operations 
fas also calls for consistency in 
table of contents reporting changes in the parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary and necessitates fair value measurement of any non controlling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation 
fas is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  therefore  we are required to adopt fas on january  we are currently evaluating the requirements of fas and the potential impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  which amends sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  by requiring increased qualitative  quantitative  and credit risk disclosures about an entity s derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets  or fsp no 
fas fsp no 
fas amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
the intent of fsp no 
fas is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under fas r and other us generally accepted accounting principles 
fsp no 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of fsp no 
fas on our consolidated results of operations and financial conditions 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  or sfas sfas identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles the gaap hierarchy 
sfas will become effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
we do not currently expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition

results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to growth in revenue due to increased volumes with our ten largest clients from both existing and new services provided to those clients in revenues for services performed in our us and canada service centers decreased million  or  for the year ended december   as a result of large volumes from a seasonal client in the year ended december   coupled with an isp client contract which ended in the last half of revenues for services performed in european service centers increased million  or 
the majority of this increase is attributable to increased volumes from both new and existing clients  coupled with additional revenue due to a strengthened euro relative to the us dollar 
revenues for services performed in offshore service centers in india  costa rica  the dominican republic and tunisia increased million  or  due to additional volume from existing and new clients 
revenues in our offshore service centers represented of consolidated revenues for the year ended december   compared to in the same period in we expect our revenues to continue to grow in our revenue growth is a result of a number of factors 
these factors include a re vamp of our sales and client management teams  introduction of new services such as warranty and up sell programs and winning of new client contracts from both existing and new accounts 
we believe that our growth is being effected positively by a number of macro economic factors that include our clients propensity to outsource to gain flexible solutions  our clients seeking to work with more global service providers like us and an ongoing effort by certain of our clients to consolidate service providers to those with global operations and broader service offerings 
direct cost of revenue 
direct cost of revenue exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to incremental labor cost required to support revenue growth 
after excluding the million canadian and euro currency exchange impact  direct labor costs increased from million to million  or 
we expect cost of services as a percentage of revenues to decline in the future 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from to 
gross margin percentage increased primarily due to higher margin contracts implemented and better management of our costs in connection with services performed in our european service centers 
following the acquisition of shc  we implemented a number of changes  including hiring key operating personnel in the america s operations 
our focus on operations improved certain metrics such as agent utilization  average call handle time  agent attrition and productivity 
in addition  our focus on operating metrics resulted in an increase in customer satisfaction 
we expect gross profit as a percentage of revenues to continue to improve in fiscal due to continuing improvements in operating metrics and investment in new tools and technologies to improve efficiencies 
we are also expanding into new geographic regions such as egypt  south america  latin america and the philippines 
these new regions are expected to produce higher gross profit as a percentage of revenues due to the lower labor rates in those countries 
operating expenses 
operating expenses which includes depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million or of revenues for the year ended december   
table of contents compared to million or of revenues for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in selling  general and administrative expense  which grew from million to million  or 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was due to i a million increase in labor costs due to incremental management  operations and administrative staff required to support our revenue growth  and ii an occupancy expense increase of million primarily attributable to new service center openings after the first half of  and a million canadian and euro currency exchange impact 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were approximately for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  we expect that the selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues will increase in due to investments in sales and marketing  operations personnel and investments in information technology 
we also expect that we will incur additional costs in finance and legal due to implementation of sarbanes oxley and the general requirements of being a publicly traded company 
depreciation and amortization increased million as a result of additions to equipment and fixtures totaling million including capital leases during the twelve months ended december  the additions to equipment and fixtures were to support new business  open new service centers and maintain and upgrade our technology infrastructure 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  other income expenses  net 
other income expenses  net increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase consisted of a foreign exchange gain for the year ended december  of million  compared to a foreign exchange loss of million for the year ended december  foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of intercompany activity and related hedging 
we expect interest expense to increase in due to the new bank debt agreement that we finalized in january which has a higher blended interest rate than the prior bank loan agreements 
income taxes 
income taxes increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  foreign tax expense comprised million for the year ended december  and million for the same period in and the effective foreign tax rate increased from to 
the increase in expense was driven by a million charge in respect to additional foreign tax liabilities  higher income in foreign jurisdictions offset by the decrease in the effective rate reflecting changes in the mix of operations 
we operate in a number of countries outside the us that are generally taxed at lower rates and this can have a significant impact on the effective tax rate 
we are in process of re organizing our legal entity structure to more efficiently utilized both our income tax and cash management process  and in an effort to reduce our income tax provision in the future 
net income loss 
net loss decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to increased revenue and margins offset by increased income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are for financing working capital associated with the expenses we incur in performing services under our client contracts and capital expenditures for the opening of new service centers  including the purchase of computers and related equipment 
we have in place a credit facility that includes term loans and a revolving line of credit that allow us to manage our cash flows 
our ability to make payments on the credit facility  to replace our indebtedness  and to fund working capital and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
we have secured our working capital facility through our accounts receivable and therefore  our ability to continue servicing debt is dependant upon the timely collection of those receivables 
on a pro forma basis  we made capital expenditures of million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the prior year for shc 
we continue to make capital expenditures to build new 
table of contents service centers  meet new contract requirements and maintain and upgrade our technology 
we expect to continue to expand into new facilities in such as in the philippines  egypt  tunisia and south and latin america 
we also expect to invest in technology initiatives such as home shoring  unified communications and enabling technology  business continuity and data security  web based solutions and applications and distributed collaboration networking 
the convergence of voice and data as well as the demand for real time diagnostics and analytics by our clients are requiring us to make substantial future investments in technology and solutions that will require additional capital investments

on march   we entered into the reimbursement agreement with ares described above in this liquidity and capital resources section  and we expect to request that ares provide replacement letters of credit for some or all of our outstanding standby letters of credit 

table of contents contractual obligations 
we have various contractual obligations that will affect our liquidity 
the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations capital lease obligations total certain facility leases are backed by letters of credit totaling approximately million at december  the obligations under the letters of credit decline annually as the underlying obligations are satisfied 
as of december   we had million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  and working capital measured by current assets less current liabilities of million 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   a million increase from the million used in the period ended december  shc used million in cash from operations for the year ended december  non cash charges were million greater in the year ended december  than those generated in the period ended december  primarily as a result of the million increase for the depreciation and amortization of acquired assets related to the purchase of shc 
the increase of million in changes from operating assets and liabilities is due primarily to the increase of million in cash used for accrued expenses and other liabilities and an increase of million in accounts receivable 
shc non cash charges were million and changes in operating assets and liabilities was a use of cash of million for the year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities totaled million for the year ended december   a million increase from the million used in the period ended december  this is primarily attributable to the release of restrictive cash from our ipo offset by the cash used to acquire shc 
shc used million for the year ended december  primarily for investments in new sales and technology based assets 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million for the year ended december   a million increase from the million of cash provided by financing activities for the period ended december  the increase is due to proceeds from issuance of the series a preferred stock offset by cash used to purchase shares of common stock in our self tender offer and the proceeds from the sale of units in our ipo in the period ended december  shc provided million of cash in financing activities in the year ended december  primarily due to borrowings on their line of credit 
our foreign exchange forward contracts require the exchange of foreign currencies for us dollars or vice versa  and generally mature in four months or less 
we had outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts with aggregate notional amounts of million as of december  and zero as of december  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
seasonality we are exposed to seasonality in our revenues because of the nature of certain consumer based clients 
we may experience approximately increased volume associated with the peak processing needs in the fourth quarter coinciding with the holiday period and a somewhat seasonal overflow into the first quarter of the following calendar year 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our risk management strategy includes the use of derivative instruments to reduce the effects on our operating results and cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange and interest rates 
in using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates we exposes ourselves to counterparty credit risk 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our debt facilities since some of those instruments bear interest at variable rates  including capital leases 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings under variable debt agreements that totaled approximately million 
a hypothetical increase in the interest rate would have increased interest expense by approximately million and would have decreased annual cash flow by a comparable amount 
the carrying amount of our borrowings reflects fair value due to their short term and variable interest rate features 
there were no outstanding interest rate swaps covering interest rate exposure at december  foreign currency exchange rate risk we serve many of our us based clients using our service centers in canada  india  the dominican republic and costa rica 
although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in the local currency of the country in which the contracts are serviced which creates foreign exchange exposure 
we expect to begin incurring costs in the philippine peso in we are evaluating our hedging strategy related to the peso 
given the significance of our foreign operations and the potential volatility of the canadian dollar and indian rupee versus the us dollar  we use forward purchases of canadian dollars and indian rupees to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations 
as of december   we had entered into forward contracts with two financial institutions to acquire a total of million in canadian dollars at prices ranging from 
to 
usd cad and million in indian rupees at prices ranging from to usd inr 
market risk market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates  foreign exchanges  commodity prices  equity prices  and other market driven rates or prices 
changes in market rates may impact the banks libor rate or prime rate 
for instance  if either the libor or prime rate were to increase or decrease by one percentage point  our annual interest expense would change by approximately million based upon our total credit facility
