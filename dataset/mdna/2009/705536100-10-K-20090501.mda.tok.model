for a discussion of factors and trends that could impact our business and results  please refer to the section above entitled risk factors 
the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
highlights during fiscal year  we have experienced the following significant changes during the first quarter ended april   we realized a net pre tax gain of million upon the sale of substantially all of our assets to kmc 
we continue to experience a downturn in revenue due to lower demand for the technology we offer from year to year 
consolidated revenues declined from the third quarter of fiscal year product licensing revenues decreased as a result of a decrease in block licensing revenue 
engineering services and maintenance revenues declined  as of our engineering work force was transferred to kmc on april  as part of the sale to kmc 
the transaction was primarily due to downward pricing pressures arising from an increasingly competitive global market  as well as substantial pressure on our oem customers to consolidate 
the sale to kmc and the financial resources that it has provided is allowing us to pursue opportunities outside the imaging marketplace 
the overall decrease in our revenues was primarily attributable to declines in the demand for our technologies  third party technologies that we license to sell and the requirement for traditional engineering services 
we have significantly reduced our staffing levels while striving to achieve the goals of properly supporting our existing customer base and meeting the requirements of a publicly traded company 
we have reduced our staffing levels to a total of as of march  this represents a staff reduction from the levels that existed immediately after the kmc transaction 
we have significantly reduced our facilities cost by terminating the leases for  square feet in kent washington and  square feet in el segundo  california 
we have sublet  square feet for our headquarters resulting in savings of approximately million in annual rental costs 
in  we entered into a postscript software development license and sublicense agreement  or the adobe license agreement  with adobe that expanded the application and integration of our respective technologies 
the adobe license agreement expired on june  the adobe license agreement was amended to provide a period of twenty one months following the expiration of the agreement in which we continue to license and provide services to our existing oem customers 
our inability to implement our strategic plan  develop and offer products  and manage expansion in the aforementioned marketplaces  as well as the declining sales trend of our existing licenses  downward price pressure on our existing technologies  uncertainty surrounding third party license revenue sharing agreements  downward price pressure on oem products and the anticipated consolidation of the number of oems in the marketplace  may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results

risk factors 
the future demand for our products is uncertain above 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that they believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
we account for our software revenues in accordance with statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  staff accounting bulletin no  revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
over the past several years  we entered into block license agreements that represent unit licenses for products that will be licensed over a period of time 
in accordance with sop  revenue is recognized when the following attributes have been met an agreement exists between us and the oem selling product utilizing our intellectual property and or a third party s intellectual property for which we are an authorized licensor  delivery and acceptance of the intellectual property has occurred  the fees associated with the sale are fixed and determinable  and collection of the fees are probable 
under our accounting policies  fees are fixed and determinable if of the fees are to be collected within a twelve month period  in accordance with sop if more than of the payments of fees extend beyond a twelve month period  they are recognized as revenues when they are due for payment  in accordance with sop for fees on multiple element arrangements  values are allocated among the elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  vsoe 
we generally establish vsoe based upon the price charged when the same elements are sold separately 
when vsoe exists for all undelivered elements  but not for the delivered elements  revenue is recognized using the residual method as prescribed by statement of position if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered elements  all revenue for the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such vsoe does exist for the undelivered elements or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered  unless the only undelivered element is a service in which revenue from the delivered element is recognized over the service period 
we recognize revenues for certain of our engineering services projects on a percentage of completion basis  in accordance with accounting research bulletin  long term construction type contracts  and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the estimates to complete the projects are determined by the individual project engineering manager responsible for the oversight of the individual projects 
the estimates are made at the end of each accounting period and are subject to unforeseen circumstances that can increase or decrease the hours necessary to complete the efforts 
for fiscal years  and  we reported no engineering services revenues on a percentage of completion basis 
we provide an accrual for estimated product licensing costs owed to third party vendors whose technology is included in the products sold by us 
the accrual is impacted by estimates of the mix of products shipped under certain of our block license agreements 
the estimates are based on historical data and available information as provided by our customers concerning projected shipments 
should actual shipments under these agreements vary from these estimates  adjustments to the estimated accruals for product licensing costs may be required 
such adjustments have historically been within management s expectations 
however  product licensing cost increased by million during the third quarter of fiscal as a result of a change in estimate reported by one of our oem customers and decreased by million in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the settlement of differences arising from a third party licensing agreement review 
as of january   we had tax credit carry forwards available to reduce future income tax liabilities of approximately million which begin to expire fiscal year the realization of these assets is based upon management s estimates of future taxable income 
we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of any customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based primarily on specifically identified customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of any of our customers  or the economy as a whole  were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
actual results have historically been consistent with management s estimates 
our recurring product licensing revenues are dependent  in part  on the timing and accuracy of product sales reports received from our oem customers 
these reports are provided only on a calendar quarter basis and  in any event  are subject to delay and potential revision by the oem 
therefore  we are required to estimate all of the recurring product licensing revenues for the last month of each fiscal quarter and to further estimate all of our quarterly revenues from an oem when the report from such oem is not received in a timely manner 
in the event we are unable to estimate such revenues accurately prior to reporting financial results  we may be required to adjust revenues in subsequent periods 
actual results have historically been consistent with management s estimates 
on february   we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  prior period results are not restated 
compensation cost recognized subsequent to adoption includes i compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but unvested as of january   based on the grant date fair value  which is determined in accordance with the original provision of sfas no 
using a black scholes option pricing model  and ii compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to february   based on the grant date fair value  which is determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no r using a black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of share based awards 
we use our actual stock trading history as a basis to calculate the expected volatility assumption to value stock options 
the expected dividend yield is based on peerless practice of not paying dividends 
the risk free rate of return is based on the yield of us treasury strips with terms equal to the expected life of the option as of the grant date 
the expected life in years is based on historical actual stock option exercise experience 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if actual forfeitures vary from our estimates  we will recognize the difference in compensation cost in the period the actual forfeitures occur 
upon adoption of sfas r  we changed our method of attributing the value of stock based compensation expense from the multiple option ie accelerated approach to the single option ie straight line method 
compensation expense for share based awards granted through january  will continue to be subject to the accelerated multiple option method  while compensation expense for share based awards granted on or after february  will be recognized using a straight line  or single option method 
we recognize these compensation costs over the service period of the award  which is generally the options vesting term of four years 
we recorded  in share based compensation expense during the fiscal year ended january  share based compensation expense was allocated as follows for the twelve month period ended january   included in cost of sales   included in research and development expense   included in sales and marketing and  included in general and administrative expense 
we granted options to purchase  shares of common stock for the fiscal year ended january  on february   we adopted fin see note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information

net income net income for the twelve month period ended january  was million or per basic and per diluted share  compared to a net income of million  or per basic and per diluted share  in fiscal year  and a net income of million  or per basic and per diluted share  in fiscal year consolidated revenues for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year was primarily the result of the asset sale to kyocera mita corporation 
the decrease in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily the result of the decrease in block license sales 
product licensing revenues for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year block licensing agreements totaling million were signed during fiscal year  all of which was recognized as revenue during fiscal year this is compared with block licensing agreements of million signed in fiscal year  of which million was recognized as revenue during fiscal year the decrease in product licensing revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was the result of the elimination of licensing revenues from kmc as a result of the sale and a decline in the demand for our technologies and services 
engineering services and maintenance revenues generated by us were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the decrease resulted from the kmc sale and the transfer of employees to kmc 
the decrease realized over the previous two years was the result of increased competition for business on a global basis 
there were no hardware sales in fiscal year  compared to minimal sales in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the decreases from fiscal to and were the result of the discontinuance of the everest controller product 
contract and maintenance backlog at january  was approximately million  as compared with million at january  cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal year was million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year product licensing costs were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year in product licensing costs was the result of the million change in estimate of third party licensing costs as a result of the restructured license agreement with kmc 
the overall decrease in cost of revenues over the last two years was the result of lower levels of third party technologies in our product licensing revenues 
engineering services and maintenance cost of sales decreased to million in fiscal year compared to and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal year over fiscal year was due the employees transferred to kmc as a part of the asset sale 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year  and in fiscal year the percentage decrease in fiscal year was the result of the million change in estimate of third party licensing costs as a result of the restructured license agreement with kmc 
operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal year were million  which includes a million gain and million restructuring expenses associated with the kmc asset sale  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year research and development expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year over fiscal year was due to a decrease in staffing 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the decreases over the last two fiscal years were the result of a reduction in staffing levels and sales commission expense 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the fiscal level was impacted by the high level of professional fees associated with the kmc transaction and the restructuring subsequent to the transaction 
interest income  other income and expenses  and taxes interest income earned in all fiscal years was attributable to interest and investment income earned on cash and cash equivalents and investment balances 
the year to year increases were the result of higher levels of investments 
on february   we adopted fin fin clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income tax law 
this interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
the interpretation requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority as of the reporting date 
if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained  then no benefits of the position are to be recognized 
the tax benefit expected to be realized from deferred tax assets upon the consummation of the kmc transaction was primarily the result of research and development tax credits 
the provisions for income taxes for fiscal years prior to were primarily the result of foreign income taxes paid 
these income taxes were paid through withholdings on payments of licensing revenues made by our customers to us 
as of january  we continue to provide a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty with respect to our ability to generate future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income or reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based on this consideration  we determined that it is more likely than not that million of certain deferred tax assets will be realized in fiscal year reducing the effective rate for fiscal year the tax provision for fiscal year was credited for a million reduction in the valuation reserve for deferred tax assets realized in fiscal year in connection with the kmc transaction 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at january   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at january  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations outstanding purchase orders total liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents  which  as of january   were million in the aggregate  compared to million at january  the increase was primarily the result of cash provided by investing activities of million  which includes the gain associated with the kmc asset sale 
compared to january   total assets at january  increased to million and stockholders equity increased to million 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was compared to last year 
we used million in cash by operations during the twelve month period ended january   as compared to million in cash provided by operations during the twelve month period ended january  as noted above  our investing activities during the fiscal year ended january  provided cash of million compared to million used in fiscal year during fiscal year  million was provided by exercise of stock options and million was used in the purchase of treasury stock 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal year at january   net trade receivables were million lower than at january   due to the lower level of licensing revenues at year end and to the timing of the signings and collections of the licensing agreements 
on april   we consummated the transactions contemplated by that certain asset purchase agreement  dated as of january   between kmc and peerless 
as consideration for the sale  kmc assumed certain of our liabilities  and paid us approximately million  less a holdback amount of million relating to potential indemnification obligations the net proceeds from the kmc transaction have been used for general corporate purposes  including satisfying our working capital needs and paying our liabilities as they come due  relating to the assets that we retain following the consummation of this transaction  including our rights under our sublicenses with adobe systems incorporated and novell  inc and our customized intellectual property 
in addition to the net proceeds that we received from the kmc transaction  our operating costs and selling  general and administrative expenses have been significantly reduced  freeing up additional capital which will permit us to pursue our long term goal of providing new growth opportunities and a diversified revenue base 
we intend to aggressively seek investment opportunities leveraged by the infusion of capital resulting from this transaction 
our long term strategy includes diversifying our business to better ensure growth and profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of january   we do not hold any positions in equity securities of other publicly traded companies 
we are exposed to a variety of risks in investments  mainly a lowering of interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal of our investments and to maintain a liquid level of investments to meet short term capital requirements for potential investment opportunities  while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we  from time to time  maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents  fixed rate debt instruments of the federal  state and local governments and high quality corporate issuers and short term investments in money market funds 
as of january   we did not hold any corporate debt securities 
although we are subject to interest rate risks  we believe an effective increase or decrease of in interest rate percentages would not have a material adverse effect on our results from operations 
we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments 
currently all of our contracts  including those involving foreign entities  are denominated in us dollars and as a result  we have experienced no significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date  and have no intention of doing so
