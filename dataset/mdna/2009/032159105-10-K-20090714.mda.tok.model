item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction for a description of the company s business  refer to item of part i of this annual report on form k 
as indicated in item  the company is primarily engaged in four business segments the real estate business operated by amrep southwest and the subscription fulfillment services  newsstand distribution services and product fulfillment services and other businesses operated by kable collectively  media services 
the company s foreign sales and activities are not significant 
previously  the company reported three business segments  however  as a result of the purchase of assets of certain businesses in november see note  the company has reclassified certain revenues  expenses and capital expenditures for prior reporting periods that were previously reported as part of its subscription fulfillment services segment and has reported them with revenues  expenses and capital expenditures of those businesses since the date of purchase as a separate segment  product fulfillment services and other 
data concerning industry segments is set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
all references in this item to  and mean the fiscal years ended april   and  unless otherwise qualified 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company discloses its significant accounting policies in the notes to its audited consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of those financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas that require significant judgments and estimates to be made include i the determination of revenue recognition for the newsstand distribution services business  which is based on estimates of allowances for magazine returns to the company from wholesalers and the offsetting returns of magazines by the company to publishers for credit  ii allowances for doubtful accounts  iii real estate cost of sales calculations  which are based on land development budgets and estimates of costs to complete  iv cash flow and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long lived assets  goodwill impairment and assets held for sale  v actuarially determined benefit obligations for pension plan accounting  vi risk assessment of certain uncertain tax positions  and vii legal contingencies 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
there are numerous critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas 
management bases its critical assumptions on historical experience  third party data and various other estimates that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the most critical assumptions made in arriving at these accounting estimates include the following i newsstand distribution services revenues represent commissions earned from the distribution of publications for client publishers  which are recorded by the company at the time the publications go on sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
the publications generally are sold on a fully returnable basis  which is in accordance with prevailing trade practice 
accordingly  the company provides for estimated returns by charges to income that are determined on an issue by issue basis utilizing historical experience and current sales information 
the financial impact to the company of a change in the sales estimate for magazine returns to it from its wholesalers is substantially offset by the simultaneous change in the company s estimate of its cost of purchases since it passes on the returns to publishers for credit 
as a result  the effect of a difference between the actual and estimated return rates on the company s commission revenues is the amount of the commission attributable to the difference 
the effect of an increase or decrease in the company s estimated rate of returns of during any period would be dependent upon the mix of magazines involved and the related selling prices and commission rates  but would generally result in a change in that period s net commission revenues of approximately  ii management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by attempting to identify troubled accounts by analyzing the credit risk of specific customers and by using historical experience applied to the aging of accounts and  where appropriate within the real estate business  by reviewing any collateral which may secure a receivable  iii real estate development costs are incurred throughout the life of a project  and the costs of initial sales from a project frequently must include a portion of costs that have been budgeted based on engineering estimates or other studies  but not yet incurred  iv asset impairment determinations including that of goodwill  which is based on the fair value of reporting units are based upon the intended use of assets and expected future cash flows  v benefit obligations and other pension plan accounting and disclosures are based upon numerous assumptions and estimates  including the expected rate of investment return on retirement plan assets  the discount rate used to determine the present value of liabilities  and certain employee related factors such as turnover  retirement age and mortality 
as of april   the effect of every change in the investment rate of return on retirement plan assets would increase or decrease the pension expense by approximately  per year  and the effect of every change in the discount rate would increase or decrease the subsequent year s pension cost by approximately  vi the company assesses risk for certain uncertain tax positions and recognizes the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities  and vii the company is currently involved in legal proceedings which are described in item of this annual report on form k 
it is possible that the consolidated financial position or results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an outcome of litigation that is significantly different from the company s assumptions 
results of operations year ended april  compared to year ended april  the company recorded a pre tax  non cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of of   after tax  or per share 
this impairment charge reflected the write off of all of the goodwill of the company s subscription fulfillment services segment 
after giving effect to this impairment charge  the company had a net loss of  or per share  for fiscal compared to net income of  or per share  in revenues for were  compared to  in the prior year 
results for were entirely from continuing operations  including the impairment charge  while s results included a net loss from discontinued operations of  or per share  that reflected costs incurred in connection with the settlement of all litigation related to the company s el dorado  new mexico water utility subsidiary that were in addition to costs that had been accrued for this matter in excluding the impairment charge  the net loss from continuing operations was  or per share  for this included the fourth quarter write off of a  receivable from a major magazine wholesaler which recently closed its business  after tax  or per share 
the primary reason for the fourth quarter non cash goodwill impairment charge was the lower than expected fiscal revenues and operating results of the company s subscription fulfillment services segment and a change in the company s internally projected future cash flows from that segment based on current industry trends 
these reduced results and expectations reflected the well publicized decline in the magazine publishing industry during fiscal  which represents the subscription fulfillment services segment s principal customer base  as well as the deep recession which has impacted the us economy and consumers and the uncertainty about when this recession will end 
the goodwill impairment charge is a non cash item which is not expected to affect the day to day operations of the company or its subscription fulfillment services segment 
revenues from land sales at amrep southwest decreased from  in to  in amrep southwest continues to experience substantially lower land sales in its principal market of rio rancho  new mexico due to the continuing severe decline in the real estate market in the greater albuquerque metro and rio rancho areas 
total acres sold were in  in and  in the trend of declining permits for new home construction in the rio rancho area also continues  with fewer single family residential building permits issued during than in the company believes that this decline has been consistent with the well publicized problems of the national home building industry and credit markets  including fewer sales of both new and existing homes  an increasing number of mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures and a tightening of mortgage availability 
faced with these adverse conditions  builders have slowed the pace of building on developed lots previously purchased from the company in rio rancho and delayed or cancelled the purchase of additional developed lots 
these factors have also contributed to a steep decline in the sale of undeveloped land to both builders and investors 
in rio rancho  the company offers for sale both developed and undeveloped lots to national  regional and local home builders  commercial and industrial property developers and others 
the average selling price of land sold by the company in rio rancho was  per acre in   per acre in and  per acre in  reflecting differences in the mix of the types of properties sold in each period 
as a result of these and other factors  including the nature and timing of specific transactions  revenues and related gross profits from real estate land sales can vary significantly from period to period and prior results are not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods 
revenues from the company s media services operations decreased from  for to  for magazine publishers  who are the principal customers of the company s media services operations  suffered generally from lower advertising revenues and lower subscription and newsstand sales during both periods  which led to reduced business for the company s media services operations 
revenues from subscription fulfillment services operations decreased from  for to  for  primarily reflecting the net effect of reduced and lost business that resulted from lower publisher customer volumes and higher attrition of magazine titles than has been previously experienced  offset in part by revenue gains from new and some existing clients 
revenues from newsstand distribution services decreased from  for to  in with the decline due in part to the effects of a disruption in the wholesale distribution industry during the fourth quarter of caused by the closure of a major newsstand distribution wholesaler 
revenues from product fulfillment services and other increased from  for to  for  primarily from the inclusion of a product repackaging and fulfillment business and a temporary staffing business from the date of their asset purchases in november media services operating expenses increased by  for compared to  primarily attributable to the  write off of an uncollectible account receivable from the major newsstand distribution wholesaler that closed and  to a lesser extent  higher consulting and computer systems integration costs of the subscription fulfillment services business 
although there are multiple revenue streams in the subscription fulfillment services business  including revenues from the maintenance of customer computer files and the performance of other fulfillment related activities  including telephone call center support and graphic arts and lettershop services  a customer generally contracts for and utilizes all available services as a total package  and the company would not normally provide ancillary services to a customer unless it was also providing the core service of maintaining a database of subscriber names 
thus  variations in subscription fulfillment services revenues are the result of fluctuations in the number and sizes of customers rather than in the demand for a particular service 
this is also true in the newsstand distribution services business where there is only one primary service provided  which results in one revenue source  the commissions earned on the distribution of magazines 
the company competes with other companies  including three much larger companies in the newsstand distribution services business and one larger company in the subscription fulfillment services business  and the competition for new customers is intense in both segments  which results in a price sensitive industry that limits the company s ability to increase its prices 
in january  the company announced a project to consolidate its subscription fulfillment services business operations from three locations in colorado  florida and illinois into one existing location at palm coast  florida  which is expected to streamline operations  improve service to clients and create cost efficiencies through reduced overhead costs and the elimination of operating redundancies 
this project  which is now well underway  is expected to require capital expenditures in the range of  to  it is scheduled to be implemented over the next two years and may involve approximately  of non recurring cash costs for severance  training and transition  facility closings and equipment relocation 
the state of florida and the city of palm coast have agreed to provide incentives for the project  including cash and employee training grants and tax relief  which could amount to as much as  largely contingent on existing job retention  new job creation and capital investment 
previously during  the company announced i one significant workforce reduction in its subscription fulfillment services business that occurred in the third quarter  and ii a plan to redistribute the work performed at the marion  ohio facility of its subscription fulfillment services business and the scheduled closing of that facility and the consolidation of subscription fulfillment operations customer call centers  which was completed in during  the company recognized  of income for certain incentives related to the consolidation project  which are netted with costs of  principally for severance 
as a result  the company reported a net charge to operations of  related to the consolidation project in compared to a net charge of  for  principally for severance and consulting costs 
the items of income for incentives and costs related to the consolidation project are included in restructuring and fire recovery costs in the company s consolidated statements of operations and retained earnings 
in december  a warehouse of approximately  square feet leased by a kable subsidiary in oregon  illinois and its contents were totally destroyed by fire 
the warehouse was used principally to store back issues of magazines published by certain customers for whom the company filled back issue orders as part of its services 
the company was required to provide insurance for that property of certain of those customers 
through june   the company s insurance carrier had paid approximately  to customers for lost materials 
the company believes that the resolution of other pending or unasserted claims related to materials of certain publishers for whom it was required to provide insurance after taking into account the proceeds from its property insurance claims  will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company has filed a preliminary claim with its insurance provider for its property loss as a result of the fire and has been advanced  for replacement of such property 
during  the company replaced a portion of the fixed assets lost in the warehouse fire and recorded a  gain resulting from the recognition of insurance proceeds  which is netted against costs related to the fire  principally for legal and other advisory costs that were not covered by insurance 
as a result  the company reported a net gain to operations of  for in the company recorded a net charge to operations of  related to fire recovery costs 
the item of income related to insurance proceeds and the fire recovery costs are included in restructuring and fire recovery costs in the company s consolidated statements of operations and retained earnings 
in addition  the company recorded  of other income in for a business interruption claim resulting from the fire 
interest and other revenues decreased  for compared to  primarily due to a pre tax gain from the sale of a commercial property  and the forfeiture of deposits for the purchase of land by homebuilders who did not exercise purchase options  in  with no similar transactions occurring in in addition  interest and other revenues were also lower in compared to due to lower cash balances to invest 
real estate commissions and selling expenses decreased  for compared to  principally due to the reduced land sales 
other operating expenses increased  for compared to the prior year  primarily due to a net favorable  adjustment to real estate tax expense in resulting from the finalization of a property tax valuation appeal by amrep southwest 
general and administrative expenses of media services operations increased  in compared to  primarily due to the aforementioned higher consulting fees and computer system integration costs associated with the consolidation project of the subscription fulfillment services business 
real estate operations and corporate general and administrative expense decreased  for compared to  primarily due to reduced professional fees 
the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations was in compared to in the decrease from the statutory rate in was primarily due to i permanent items  the most significant being the charge against book income associated with non amortizable goodwill  and ii the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations 
the decrease from the statutory rate in was primarily due to tax benefits associated with charitable contributions of land and tax exempt interest income 
year ended april  compared to year ended april  results of operations net income in was  or per share  compared to net income of  or per share 
results for consisted of net income from continuing operations of  or per share  and a net loss from discontinued operations of  or per share  compared to results which consisted of net income from continuing operations of  or per share  and a net loss from discontinued operations of  or per share 
revenues were  a decrease of  from revenues of  the decrease in revenues was attributable to reduced land sales revenues from the company s real estate operations  offset in part by the increased subscription fulfillment services revenues from the inclusion of palm coast s revenues for all of as compared with three and a half months in the decrease in net income from continuing operations was principally due to the reduced land sales 
the net loss from discontinued operations in was attributable to  of costs incurred in connection with the settlement of all litigation related to the company s el dorado  new mexico water utility subsidiary that were in addition to costs estimated and accrued for this matter in the fourth quarter of the amount accrued for the settlements in  including legal fees  was  net of tax  and was also accounted for as a discontinued operation 
revenues from real estate land sales at amrep southwest decreased from  in to  in this decrease was due to substantially lower land sales in the company s principal market of rio rancho  new mexico  reflecting the severe decline that occurred in this market in compared to and earlier years 
the number of permits for new home construction was down significantly for calendar compared to  with rio rancho showing a decrease of nearly 
this decline was generally consistent with the well publicized problems of the national home building industry  including fewer sales of both new and existing homes  the increasing number of mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures and a tightening of mortgage availability 
faced with these adverse conditions  builders slowed the pace of building on land previously purchased from the company in rio rancho and  in some cases  delayed or cancelled the purchase of additional land 
these factors also contributed to a sharp decline in sales of undeveloped land to both builders and investors 
revenues from sales of developed lots to homebuilders decreased from  in to  in  principally due to a reduction in the number of lots sold 
revenues from sales of undeveloped builder lots decreased from  in to  in  principally due to a reduction in the number of lots sold and  to a lesser extent  a lower average price per lot due to a greater number of lots sold from locations in rio rancho that were further removed from developed areas 
revenues from sales of commercial and industrial properties decreased in to  from  in as a result of fewer and lower valued transactions 
the average gross profit percentage on land sales decreased from in to for  principally attributable to lower selling prices for commercial and undeveloped lots in the average selling price of land sold by the company in rio rancho declined from  per acre in to  per acre in  reflecting differences in the mix of the types of properties sold in each period and the effects of a strong regional market in in rio rancho and a much softer market in as a result of these and other factors  including the nature and timing of specific transactions  revenues and related gross profits from real estate land sales can vary significantly from period to period and prior results are not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods 
kable s revenues increased  from  in to  in  principally attributable to the january acquisition of palm coast 
subscription fulfillment services revenues increased by  from  in to  in due to the contribution from palm coast 
the increase in revenues from the palm coast acquisition was partially offset by decreases in other parts of kable s subscription fulfillment services business that resulted from continued competitive market pressures and customer losses 
pricing pressure from customers also had a negative effect on subscription fulfillment services revenues 
newsstand distribution services revenues decreased by  from  in to  in the decrease in newsstand distribution services revenues was due to reduced billings and lower commission rates  as well as the inclusion of certain revenues in the prior year that did not recur in product fulfillment services and other revenues were generally unchanged from to media services operating expenses increased by  in compared to  primarily attributable to the addition of operating expenses of palm coast  which were offset in part by decreased payroll and benefit expenses resulting from lower revenues in other parts of kable s subscription fulfillment services business 
the company s project to integrate certain other aspects of the kable and palm coast subscription fulfillment operations in order to improve operating efficiencies and customer service and also to reduce costs resulted in charges of  in  principally for severance and other consulting costs related to the integration  and these costs are included in the restructuring and fire recovery costs in the company s consolidated statement of income 
there were no similar costs in the december  accidental fire that totally destroyed a leased warehouse resulted in a charge to operations of approximately  from the write off of gross assets of  net of  of accumulated depreciation 
in addition  the company recorded other charges to operations of  related to fire recovery costs for the year ended april   principally due to legal and other costs that were not covered by insurance and these costs were included in the restructuring and fire recovery costs in the company s consolidated statement of income 
real estate commissions and selling expenses decreased  in compared to  principally attributable to the reduced volume of land sales 
other operating expenses decreased  in compared to  principally due to a favorable adjustment of approximately  in the third quarter of for real estate tax expense resulting from the finalization of a property tax valuation appeal by amrep southwest 
media services general and administrative expenses increased  in compared to as the addition of the palm coast expenses was only partially offset by lower costs in other subscription fulfillment services operations 
real estate operations and corporate general and administrative expenses decreased  in compared to  principally as a result of lower professional and consulting services costs 
interest and other revenues decreased by  in compared to the decrease was partly attributable to lower cash balances to invest in in addition  during  the company sold a commercial rental property at amrep southwest that resulted in a pre tax gain of  and it also recognized pre tax income of  from the forfeiture of deposits for the purchase of land by homebuilders who did not exercise purchase options 
during the first quarter of  the company sold certain of amrep southwest s investment assets  including the company s office building in rio rancho  which in the aggregate contributed a pre tax gain of  the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations was in compared to in the decrease from the statutory rate in both years was primarily due to tax benefits associated with charitable contributions of land and tax exempt interest income 
liquidity and capital resources the company finances its operations from internally generated funds and from borrowings under its various loan agreements 
cash flows from financing activities in january  amrep southwest entered into a loan agreement that replaced a prior loan agreement 
the new loan agreement consisted of a new  term loan facility and an existing  unsecured revolving credit facility from the secured agreement it replaced 
during september  the maturity date of the revolving credit facility was extended from september to september  with all other terms remaining unchanged

the present credit agreement requires the borrowers to maintain certain financial ratios  which are changed in a number of respects from those contained in the prior credit agreement 
the present credit agreement  as did the prior credit agreement  also contains other customary covenants and restrictions  the most significant of which limit the ability of the borrowers to declare or pay dividends or make other distributions to the company  and that limit the annual amount borrowers may incur for capital expenditures and other purposes and impose certain minimum ebitda requirements on the borrowers

 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related disclosures  which requires that industry segment information be prepared in a manner consistent with the manner in which financial information is prepared and evaluated by management for making operating decisions 
a number of assumptions and estimations are required to be made in the determination of segment data  including the need to make certain allocations of common costs and expenses among segments 
on an annual basis  management has evaluated the basis upon which costs are allocated  and has periodically made revisions to these methods of allocation 
accordingly  the determination of income from continuing operations before income taxes of each segment as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements is presented for informational purposes  and is not necessarily the amount that would be reported if the segment were an independent company 
impact of inflation operations of the company can be impacted by inflation 
within the industries in which the company operates  inflation can cause increases in the cost of materials  services  interest and labor 
unless such increased costs are recovered through increased sales prices or improved operating efficiencies  operating margins will decrease 
within the land development industry  the company encounters particular risks 
a large part of the company s real estate sales are to homebuilders who face their own inflationary concerns that rising housing costs  including interest costs  may substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers and make it difficult for them to finance the purchase of a new home or sell their existing home 
if this situation were to exist  the demand for the company s land by these homebuilder customers could decrease 
in general  in recent years interest rates have been at historically low levels and other price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in the company s markets  and as a result the company has not found the inflation risk to be a significant problem in any of its businesses
