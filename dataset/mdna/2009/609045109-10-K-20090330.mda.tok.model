item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of monarch community bank 
the discussion and analysis does not include any comments relating to monarch community bancorp since monarch community bancorp has no significant operations 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
monarch s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on loans  investments  and overnight deposits  and interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowings 
monarch s results of operations also are significantly affected by the level of its gains from sales of mortgage loans 
critical accounting policies other than described in note to the consolidated financial statements  management does not believe the use of estimates and management judgment is likely to present a material risk to the financial statements 
in cases where estimates or management judgment are required  internal controls and processes are established to provide assurance that such estimates and management judgments are materially correct to the best of management s knowledge 
management strategy our strategy is to operate as an independent retail oriented financial institution dedicated to serving the needs of customers in our market area 
we are committed to providing a broad range of products and services to meet the needs of our consumer and small business customers 
as part of this commitment  we expect to continue our origination of higher credit quality residential and commercial real estate loans to borrowers in our market area 
our focus in is to lower our cost of funds through core deposit growth by broadening our relationships with consumer and business customers and continuing to provide a high level of customer service 
we will continue to monitor non interest expense 
we will continue to monitor and improve of credit quality 
we are dedicating resources to these initiatives that management believes will lead to a higher level of profitability  shareholder value and overall success 
management believes focusing on these areas in will serve the company well into the future 
changes in financial condition from december  to december  general 
monarch s total assets increased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  the most significant increase was in loans which increased million 
loans 
monarch s net loan portfolio increased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  gross loans increased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  the increase in the loan portfolio was the result of management s continued strategy to originate commercial loans 
one to four family loans decreased million as a result of this strategy 
commercial real estate loans increased million and the bank also experienced increases in the level of multifamily real estate  construction and commercial business loans due to the focus on commercial loan originations 
management expects future growth in the loan portfolio to come from increased originations of commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
securities 
the bank s security portfolio decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  securities were of total assets at december  as compared to at december  due to the bank s dependence on borrowed funds and brokered cds  management did not consider growth in the investment portfolio to be prudent in management purchases securities to maintain sufficient liquidity and to provide yield to offset declines in the loan portfolio when they occur 
liabilities 
monarch s deposits increased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  this increase was primarily in money market accounts which increased million 
brokered cds increased from million at december  to million at december  the bank has attempted to reduce its reliance on brokered and large  out of area cds  although the success of this strategy is dependent on growing core deposits 
local cd deposits increased  savings account balances decreased  million as we experience movement out of these types of accounts into higher yielding deposit account types 
other interest bearing checking accounts decreased million 
this decrease is seen as a normal balance fluctuation 
non interest bearing deposit accounts increased  the bank expects its non interest bearing deposits to increase in the future as a result of strategies to attract more small business depositors and municipal depositors 
federal home loan bank advances increased  or  to million at december  from million at december  we replaced maturing advances and increased our outstanding advances because the interest rates available on these borrowings were lower than the market interest rates for brokered cds 
for several years our strategy has been to replace borrowed funds and brokered cds with lower costing core deposits 
our lack of growth in core deposits has made this a challenge 
equity 
total equity amounted to million at december  and million at december   or and  respectively  of total assets at both dates 
the decrease in equity resulted from the repurchase during of  shares of company stock at a total cost of million and dividends payments of  net income for of  helped offset the equity reductions

rate volume analysis the following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to changes in volume  which are changes in volume multiplied by the old rate  and changes in rate  which are changes in rate multiplied by the old volume 
changes attributable to both rate and volume are shown as mixed

monarch reported net income of  for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  and net income of million in the reasons for the change in net income for the years are discussed below 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan losses increased to million for compared to million in and matched million in our net interest margin has increased from in to in compared to the decline from in to the increase from to is primarily due to the bank s cost of funds decreasing more rapidly than its yield on earning assets 
management attributes this to the declining interest rate environment consistent throughout previously the cost on interest bearing liabilities increased more rapidly in to than yields on interest earning assets in to in 
growing lower cost core deposits remains a challenge in our current market area 
our reliance on money market accounts  brokered cds and fhlb borrowings continues to have an impact on our high cost of funds 
interest income 
total interest income in decreased  primarily from the decline in interest rates consistent through this followed a  increase in compared to due to increased interest income on loans 
the modest increase in loan interest income in compared to was due to minimal growth in average loans outstanding and average yields 
the decline in the average yield in  from in to in significantly offset the increase of million in average loans outstanding from to interest expense 
total interest expense increased  in compared to this followed an increase of  in compared to the increase in was primarily due to an increase in average money market accounts of million from to the increase in was primarily the result of higher interest cost for money market accounts and cds 
despite a decline in the average cost from in to in the bank has seen its cost of funds increase because of increased market rates for cds and further competition for money market deposits which has also resulted in higher rates being paid 
provision for loan losses 
the bank recorded a provision for loan losses of million in for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in no provision for loan losses was recorded for the increased provision for was necessitated by net charge offs of million in and increased loan delinquencies at december  as compared to december  nonperforming assets increased to of assets at december  compared to 
at december  these levels have increased over the previous two years see selected financial and other data 
the bank did not record a provision in despite net charge offs of  as management believed its allowance for loan losses to be adequate 
maintaining asset quality remains a priority and while management believes our new loan originations over the last three years are of higher quality than those originated previously  more losses can be expected due to the economic conditions statewide and in the markets we operate in and provisions for loan losses in could approach the level of see loans discussion above 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased slightly to million for the year ended december  compared to million for saw an increase in income to from million for the year ended december  this represented a decrease of in compared to which increased compared to fees and service charges were million for  million for  million for income from the bounce protection program has increased from million in to million in due to increased customer usage  an increase in the per transaction fee which took effect in and a decrease in in the charge from the third party service provider of the program 
future increases in this source of income are dependent on the bank increasing the number of checking account customers 
management does not expect significant increases in bounce protection income from its existing customer base 
income from brokering residential mortgage loans decreased to  in compared to  in compared to  in during  the bank developed new mortgage banking relationships with several brokerage companies 
the bank has continued to utilize these companies as a resource for lending opportunities 
the bank does not expect brokered loan income to be a significant source of income in the future 
loan fees have declined from  in to  in due to competitive pressures as well as lower originations of construction and consumer loans 
gain on sale of loans decreased  in to  from  in our strategy  which began in has been to sell as many of the residential mortgage originations as possible to manage the bank s interest rate risk  credit risk and liquidity 
this is a continuing strategy  management expects similar results in as seen in due to the decline in interest rates 
gains in represented a  increase over gains in net gain on sale of premises and equipment was in   in and in as the company closed and disposed of one of its branch locations in coldwater in other income decreased  from  in to  in after increasing  in compared to this is due to a net gain of  on sales of foreclosed properties in compared to a net gain in compared to a net loss of  in these fluctuations were created by the bank selling more foreclosed properties in as compared to either or the net gain on sales of foreclosed properties for compared to was also impacted by the decline in the housing market in the bank does occasionally experience a gain on sale of foreclosed property  as it has become increasingly more conservative in valuing these properties upon acquisition 
management expects to be similar to in terms of foreclosure activity and thus potential gains or losses on subsequent sales of the foreclosed properties 
the soft real estate market may lead to longer holding periods as well as larger losses on disposal as compared to recent years 
non interest expense 
non interest expenses have decreased since by 
we have sought to reduce certain expenses and slow the growth of other operating expenses in an attempt to improve our profitability 
management is confident that the actions taken to control expenses will not affect the company s ability to fulfill its obligations to its customers and shareholders 
salaries and employee benefits expense increased slightly from million in to million in as a result of normal increases in salaries and wages 
there has been a decrease in expense from million in to million due to cost reduction measures implemented in including a staff reduction  modifications to certain employee benefit programs and changes to the employee health program 
these are expected to stabilize salaries and employee benefit costs in the future 
recruiting and retaining qualified staff continues to be a priority of management 
repossessed property expense has increased slightly from  in to  in management attributes this increase to increased foreclosures and expects increases in due to the downturn in the economy 
repossessed property expense has decreased from  in to  in this is attributed management s continued focus on better management of properties during the holding period  better sales efforts that have led to shorter holding periods and decreased impairment write downs due to better valuation techniques at the time of foreclosure 
professional services expenses decreased to  in compared to  in as the expenses moved to similar levels previously experienced in and for the year ended december  we did experience an increase in professional services expense of  due to the costs incurred in the company s attempt at going private 
these costs in offset decreases the company has experienced since in auditing expense  loan related legal fees and supervisory expenses 
the bank s supervisory expense has been reduced because of a charter conversion in which changed the bank s primary regulator 
we expect professional services expenses to increase in and beyond due to the company s need to continue to comply with provisions of sarbanes oxley 
amortization expense of intangible assets has decreased consistent with the aging of the core deposit intangible established upon the acquisition of msb financial in as indicated in note to the company s financial statements  this expense will continually decline over the remaining life of the related asset 
other general and administrative expense has decreased from million in to  in compared to an increase to million the increase from to is due to additional fdic insurance coverage and an increase in advertising and marketing which was primarily attributable to costs incurred in conjunction with a more aggressive marketing strategy for that did not occur in federal income taxes 
our effective tax rate for purposes of the tax provision was in compared to in  and in the difference between the effective tax rates and the federal corporate income tax rate of is attributable to the low income housing credits available to the bank from the investment in the limited partnership as well as fluctuation of permanent book and tax differences such as non taxable income and non deductible expenses 
liquidity and commitments we are required to maintain appropriate levels of liquid assets under fdic regulations 
appropriate levels are determined by our board of directors and management and are included in our asset liability management policy 
liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans 
we have maintained liquidity at levels above those believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations  including new loan funding and potential deposit outflows 
at december   our liquidity ratio  which is our liquid assets as a percentage of total deposits less certificates of deposit maturing in more than one year and plus borrowings maturing in one year or less  was 
this level of liquidity is lower than that maintained last year 
management has taken steps to increase liquidity and is confident they will be able to effectively address the bank s liquidity needs while facilitating increased profitability 
monarch s liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a product of our operating  investing and financing activities 
monarch s primary sources of funds are deposits  amortization  prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans  overnight deposits and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and overnight deposits are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
monarch also generates cash through borrowings 
monarch utilizes federal home loan bank advances to leverage its capital base and provide funds for its lending and investment activities  and to enhance its interest rate risk management 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
excess liquidity is generally invested in overnight deposits  including fed funds  and short term treasury and governmental agency securities 
on a longer term basis  monarch maintains a strategy of investing in various investments and lending products 
monarch uses its sources of funds primarily to meet its ongoing commitments  to pay maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals and to fund loan commitments 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at december   totaled million 
based on historical experience  management believes that a significant portion of these certificates of deposit can be retained by continuing to pay competitive interest rates 
if necessary  additional funding sources include additional deposits including core deposits  brokered deposits  and federal home loan bank advances 
management is committed to increasing our core deposit balances but we have had difficulty doing so and core deposit growth may not be a significant source of liquidity in the future 
based on current collateral levels  at december   monarch could borrow an additional million from the federal home loan bank at prevailing interest rates 
we anticipate we will continue to have sufficient funds  through deposits and borrowings  to meet our current commitments 
for the year ended december   monarch had a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to a net decrease of million for the year ended december  the company s primary sources of funds during were operations of million  increase in deposits of million and net proceeds from federal home loan bank advances of million 
the primary uses of funds in were an increase in net loan originations of million and repurchases of the company s stock of million 
the company s primary sources of funds during were operations of million  excess of repayments over new funding of loans of million and net proceeds from federal home loan bank advances of million 
the primary uses of funds in were a decrease in deposits of million and repurchases of the company s stock of million 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   the total unused commercial and consumer lines of credit were million and there were outstanding commitments under letters of credit of  at december   the total unused commercial and consumer lines of credit were million and there were outstanding commitments under letters of credit of  the company has no arrangements with any other entities that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
capital consistent with its goals to operate a sound and profitable financial organization  monarch actively seeks to maintain a well capitalized institution in accordance with regulatory standards 
note to the financial statements details the capital position of the bank as well as the capital levels necessary to remain well capitalized 
at december  the equity to assets ratio of the company was which management and the board of directors feels is more than adequate 
during  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock in open market purchases 
impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
our primary assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates  however  do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the price of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation 
in a period of rapidly rising interest rates  the liquidity and maturity structures of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
the principal effect of inflation  as distinct from levels of interest rates  on earnings is in the area of non interest expense 
such expense items as employee compensation  employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation 
an additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in the dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made 
we are unable to determine the extent  if any  to which properties securing our loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation 
recent developments on february   the company completed the sale of million of preferred stock and a warrant to purchase common stock to the united states department of the treasury the us treasury under us treasury s capital purchase program under the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa 
the company issued and sold  shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock series a  liquidation preference of  per share the series a preferred shares  and a ten year warrant the warrant to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock common stock at an exercise price of per share  or an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
cumulative dividends on the series a preferred shares will accrue on the liquidation preference at a rate of per annum for the first five years  and at a rate of per annum thereafter 
the securities purchase agreement  dated february  the purchase agreement  between the company and the us treasury  pursuant to which the series a preferred shares and the warrant were sold  limits the payment of dividends on the common stock to the current quarterly cash dividend of per share  limits the company s ability to repurchase its common stock  and subjects the company to certain of the executive compensation limitations included in the eesa 
as a condition to the closing of the transaction  each of the company s senior executive officers as defined in the purchase agreement executed a waiver voluntarily waiving any claim against the treasury or the company for any changes to their compensation or benefits  as required to comply with the regulation issued by the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program 
the senior executive officers also acknowledged that the regulation may require modification of the compensation  bonus  incentive and other benefit plans  arrangements and policies and agreements including so called golden parachute agreements as they relate to the period the us treasury holds any equity or debt securities of the company acquired through the capital purchase program 
in addition to eesa  on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was enacted 
the arra contains numerous provisions which modify eesa and which require additional rule making by various regulatory bodies 
the precise impact of arra and the rules promulgated under it will become known in the coming months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management and market risk our risk when interest rates change 
the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk 
how we measure our risk of interest rate changes 
as part of our attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor our interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk  we continually analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities  and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
the board of directors sets and recommends the asset and liability policies of the bank which are implemented by the asset and liability management committee 
the asset and liability management committee is comprised of members of our senior management 
the purpose of the asset and liability management committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with our business plan and board approved policies 
the asset and liability management committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset and liability management committee generally meets on a quarterly basis to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital position  anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and interest rate risk exposure limits versus current projections 
the chief financial officer is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementation and strategies to the board of directors  each quarter 
in order to manage our assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  we have focused our strategies on originating shorter term commercial real estate loans for retention in our portfolio  selling a significant portion of the long term  fixed rate residential mortgage loans we make  managing our deposits to establish stable deposit relationships with an emphasis on core  non certificate deposits  supplementing these with brokered deposits  as appropriate  and maintaining longer term borrowings at fixed interest rates to offset the negative impact of longer term fixed rate loans in our loan portfolio 
future borrowings are expected to be short term to reduce the average maturity of our borrowings 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the asset and liability management committee may determine to increase monarch s interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain the net interest margin 
in addition  in an effort to manage our interest rate risk and liquidity  in and we sold million and million  respectively  of fixed rate  one to four family mortgage loans in the secondary market 
we expect to continue to sell a significant portion of our originated long term  fixed rate  one to four family loans but may retain some portion of our year and shorter  fixed rate loans 
monarch uses an internally generated model that uses scenario analysis to evaluate the irr exposure of the bank by estimating the sensitivity of the bank s portfolios of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts to changes in market interest rates 
the information presented in the following table presents the expected change in monarch s net portfolio value at december  that would occur upon an immediate change in interest rates 
change in interest rates net portfolio value as basis points bp net portfolio value of present value of assets rate shock in rates amount change change npv ratio change bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp bp   bp bp   bp bp n m n m n m n m n m assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
based on the data from the model  management believes that the bank s irr level remains minimal 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  if interest rates change  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
the bank  like other financial institutions  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
our net interest margin can change  either positively or negatively  as the result of increases or decreases in market interest rates 
some factors affecting net interest margin are outside of our control  market interest rates are but one factor affecting the bank s net interest margin 
however  management has the ability  through its asset liability management and pricing policies to affect the bank s net interest margin notwithstanding the level of market interest rates 
the preceding table indicates the bank s net portfolio value will decrease in an increasing interest rate scenario and increase in a decreasing interest rate scenario 
management believes that its net interest margin will behave similarly 
if rising interest rates stifle loan demand or create additional competitive pressures in attracting and retaining deposits  the bank s desire for growth in total assets may cause management to alter its strategy that could negatively impact the net interest margin 
the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes  as well as the sector affected short term vs 
long term will have an impact on the bank s net interest margin 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes to interest rates as of december  the company had no derivative instruments  or trading portfolio as of that date 
the expected maturity date values for loans receivable  mortgage backed securities and investment securities were calculated without adjusting the contractual maturity dates for expectations of repayments 
expected maturity date values for non maturity  interest bearing deposits were based on the opportunity for repricing 
principal amount maturing in and fair value beyond total rate sensitive assets fed funds and overnight deposits average interest rate securities average interest rate gross loans average interest rate rate sensitive liabilities savings interest bearing demand deposits average interest rate certificates of deposit average interest rate fhlb advances average interest rate
