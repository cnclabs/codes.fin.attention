while the granting of leases is governed by many aspects of doral financial s general credit policies and procedures  due to the nature of the exposure  additional credit parameters are applied to leases 
automobile leasing is done by way of finance leases  where the lessee is responsible for any residual value at the end of the lease term

table of contents mortgage loan underwriting doral bank pr s underwriting standards are designed to comply with the relevant guidelines set forth by the department of housing and urban development hud  gnma  rhs  va  fnma  fhlmc  federal and puerto rico banking regulatory authorities  private mortgage investment conduits and private mortgage insurers  as applicable 
doral bank pr s underwriting policies focus primarily on the borrower s ability to pay and secondarily on collateral value 
the maximum loan to value ratio on conventional first mortgages generally does not exceed 
doral bank pr also offers certain first mortgage products with higher loan to value ratios  which may require private mortgage insurance 
in conjunction with a first mortgage  doral bank pr may also provide a borrower with additional financing through a closed end second mortgage loan  whose combined loan to value ratio exceeds 
doral bank pr does not originate adjustable rate mortgages arm or negatively amortizing loans 
during the first half of  the company originated loans through various mortgage banking subsidiaries each of which had different underwriting processes 
during the second half of  the company revamped its underwriting process to achieve a uniform rules based standard and improve the quality of its non conforming loan originations 
the implementation of these standards contributed to a significant reduction in the company s loan originations during the second half of and the first two quarters of the company  however  believes that these changes have allowed it to more efficiently underwrite assets with better credit quality that is consistent with the company s goal of retaining a greater portion of its loan production 
doral bank pr retains the majority of its non conforming loan originations in portfolio 
the company uses external credit scores as a useful measure for assessing the credit quality of a borrower 
these scores are supplied by credit information providers  based on statistical models that summarize an individual s credit record 
fico scores  developed by fair isaac corporation  are the most commonly used credit scores 
the implementation of the adjustments to the company s underwriting standards described above has resulted in loan originations with higher fico scores

mortgage loan servicing when doral financial sells originated or purchased mortgage loans  it generally retains the right to service such loans and to receive the associated servicing fees 
doral financial s principal source of servicing rights has traditionally been its mortgage loan production 
doral financial also seeks to purchase servicing rights in bulk when it can identify attractive opportunities 
in july of  all servicing operations were transferred to doral bank pr 
the company believes that loan servicing for third parties is important to its asset liability management tool because it provides an asset whose value in general tends to move in the opposite direction to the value 
table of contents of its loan and investment portfolio 
the asset also provides additional fee income to help offset the cost of its mortgage operations 
servicing rights represent a contractual right and not a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying mortgage loans 
failure to service the loans in accordance with contract requirements may lead to the termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees 
in general  doral bank pr s servicing agreements are terminable by the investors for cause 
however  certain servicing arrangements  such as those with fnma and fhlmc  contain termination provisions that may be triggered by changes in the servicer s financial condition that materially and adversely affect its ability to provide satisfactory servicing of the loans 
as of december   approximately  and of doral financial s mortgage loans serviced for others related to mortgage servicing for fnma  fhlmc and gnma  respectively 
as of december   doral bank pr serviced approximately billion in mortgage loans on behalf of third parties 
termination of doral bank pr s servicing rights by any of these agencies could have a material adverse effect on doral financial s results of operations and financial condition 
in certain instances  the company also services loans with no contractual servicing fee 
the servicing asset or liability associated with this type of servicing arrangement is evaluated solely based on ancillary income  float  late fees  prepayment penalties and costs 
doral bank pr s mortgage loan servicing portfolio is subject to reduction by reason of normal amortization  prepayments and foreclosure of outstanding mortgage loans 
additionally  doral bank pr may sell mortgage loan servicing rights from time to time to other institutions if market conditions are favorable 
for additional information regarding the composition of doral financial s servicing portfolio as of each of the company s last three fiscal year ends  refer to table k loans serviced for third parties in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this report 
the degree of credit risk associated with a mortgage loan servicing portfolio is largely dependent on the extent to which the servicing portfolio is non recourse or recourse 
in non recourse servicing  the principal credit risk to the servicer is the cost of temporary advances of funds 
in recourse servicing  the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans  such as fnma or fhlmc  or with a private investor  insurer or guarantor 
losses on recourse servicing occur primarily when foreclosure sale proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest of such mortgage loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property 
in the past  doral financial often sold non conforming loans on a partial recourse basis 
these recourse obligations were retained by doral financial when doral bank pr assumed the servicing rights from doral financial 
for additional information regarding recourse obligations  see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  off balance sheet activities in this report 
sale of loans and securitization activities doral financial sells or securitizes a portion of the residential mortgage loans that it originates and purchases to generate income 
these loans are underwritten to investor standards  including that of fnma  fhlmc  and gnma 
as described below  doral financial utilizes various channels to sell its mortgage products 
doral financial issues gnma guaranteed mortgage backed securities  which involve the packaging of fha loans  rhs loans or va loans into pools of million or more for sale primarily to broker dealers and other institutional investors 
during the years ended december   and  doral financial issued approximately million  million and million  respectively  in gnma guaranteed mortgage backed securities 
conforming conventional loans are generally either sold directly to fnma  fhlmc or private investors for cash  or are grouped into pools of million or more in aggregate principal balance and exchanged for fnma or fhlmc issued mortgage backed securities  which doral financial sells to broker dealers 
in connection with such exchanges  doral financial pays guarantee fees to fnma and fhlmc 
the issuance of mortgage backed securities provides doral financial with flexibility in selling the mortgage loans that it originates or purchases and also provides income by increasing the value and marketability of such loans 

table of contents for the years ended december   and  doral financial securitized approximately million  million and million  respectively  of loans into fnma and fhlmc mortgage backed securities 
in addition  for the years ended december   and  doral financial sold approximately million  million and million  respectively  of loans through the fnma and fhlmc cash window programs 
prior to the fourth quarter of  doral financial s non conforming loan sales were generally made on a limited recourse basis 
pursuant to the restructuring of several recourse transactions consummated during  the company s outstanding principal balance of loans sold subject to recourse decreased by billion  from billion as of december  to billion as of december  as of december   and  doral financial s maximum contractual exposure relating to its portfolio of loans sold with recourse was approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  which included recourse obligations to fnma and fhlmc as of such dates of approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively 
as of december   and  doral financial had a recourse liability of million  million and million  respectively  to reflect estimated losses from such recourse arrangements 
during the third quarter of  doral financial refined its estimate for determining expected losses from recourse obligations as it began to develop more data regarding historical losses from foreclosure and disposition of mortgage loans adjusted for expectations of changes in portfolio behavior and market environment 
this actual data on losses showed a substantially different experience than that used for newer loans for which insurance quotes are published 
the company believes that this method resulted in an adequate valuation of its recourse allowance as of december   but actual future recourse obligations may be different and a different result may have been obtained if the company had used another method for estimating this liability 
commencing in the fourth quarter of and continuing throughout  the company sold non conforming loans to major financial institutions in the us mainland on a non recourse basis  except recourse for certain early defaults 
during and  the company retained all of its non conforming loan production in its loan receivable portfolio 
while the company currently anticipates that it will continue to retain its non conforming loan production in portfolio  in the future  the company may seek to continue to diversify secondary market outlets for its non conforming loan products both in the us mainland and puerto rico 
in the ordinary course of business  doral financial makes certain representations and warranties to purchasers and insurers of mortgage loans at the time of the loans sales to third parties regarding the characteristics of the loans sold  and in certain circumstances  such as in the event of early or first payment default 
to the extent the loans do not meet specified characteristics  if there is a breach of contract of a representation or warranty or if there is an early payment default  doral financial may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan and bear any subsequent loss related to the loan 
doral financial works with purchasers to review the claims and correct alleged documentation deficiencies 
for the years ended december  and  repurchases amounted to million and million  respectively

puerto rico secondary mortgage market and favorable tax treatment in general  the puerto rico market for mortgage backed securities is an extension of the us market with respect to pricing  rating of investment instruments  and other matters 
however  doral financial has benefited historically from certain tax incentives provided to puerto rico residents to invest in fha and va loans and gnma securities backed by such loans 
under the puerto rico internal revenue code of the pr code  the interest received on fha and va loans used to finance the original purchase of newly constructed housing in puerto rico and mortgage

basel ii capital standards the minimum risk based capital requirements adopted by the federal banking agencies follow the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision 
in  the basel committee published its new capital guidelines basel ii governing the capital adequacy of large  internationally active banking organizations core banking organizations with at least billion in total assets or at least billion in foreign exposure 
in december  the federal banking agencies adopted final rules to implement basel ii for core banking organizations the advanced approaches final rule 
under basel ii  core banking organizations will be required to enhance the measurement and management of their risks  including credit risk and operational risk  through the use of advanced approaches for calculating risk based capital requirements 
the agencies announced they will issue a proposed rule that will provide all non core banking organizations which are not required to adopt basel ii s advance approaches  such as doral bank pr  with the option to adopt a standardized approach under basel ii the standardized approach 
the proposed rule is intended to be finalized before the core banking organizations may start their first transition period under basel ii december  
this new proposal will replace the earlier proposal to adopt the so called basel ia option 
on june   the board of directors of the fdic approved an interagency proposal that would provide banks with the option to adopt an alternative risk based capital framework based largely upon the standardized approach set forth in the basel ii framework 
the standardized approach capital framework would be available to all banks except the largest and most complex banks that are subject to the advanced approaches final rule issued on december  until such time as the new rules for non core banking institutions are adopted  doral financial is unable to predict whether it will adopt a standardized approach under basel ii or the effect that the new rules for non core banking institutions might have on doral bank pr s financial condition or results of its operations 
opting into the basel ii standardized approach would require doral bank to implement advanced measurement techniques employing internal estimates of certain key risk drivers to derive capital requirements 
opting into the basel ii standardized approach may also require meeting more onerous computational requirements 
prior to implementation of the new capital regime  a bank holding company will be required to demonstrate to its primary federal regulator that its measurement approaches meet relevant supervisory standards 
fdicia under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of and the regulations promulgated thereunder fdicia  federal banking regulators must take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
fdicia and the regulations thereunder  establish five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  
table of contents undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
a depository institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least  a risk based tier capital ratio of at least and a risk based total capital ratio of at least  and is not subject to any written agreement or regulatory directive to meet a specific capital level 
a depository institution is deemed to be adequately capitalized if it is not well capitalized but maintains a leverage ratio of at least or at least if given the highest regulatory rating and not experiencing or anticipating significant growth  a risk based tier l capital ratio of at least and a risk based total capital ratio of at least 
a depository institution is deemed to be undercapitalized if it fails to meet the standards for adequately capitalized institutions unless it is deemed to be significantly or critically undercapitalized 
an institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than  a risk based tier capital ratio of less than or a risk based total capital ratio of less than 
an institution is deemed to be critically undercapitalized if it has tangible equity equal to or less of total assets 
a depository institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives a less than satisfactory examination rating in any one of four categories 
at december   doral financial s banking subsidiaries were well capitalized 
doral bank pr s and doral bank ny s capital categories  as determined by applying the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia  may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of doral bank pr or doral bank ny  and should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding the institutions financial condition and results of operations 
fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the federal reserve system 
in addition  undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans 
a depository institution s holding company must guarantee the capital plan  up to an amount equal to the lesser of i of the depository institution s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or ii the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan 
the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining  among other things  that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it were significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator 
the capital based prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia and their implementing regulations apply to fdic insured depository institutions such as doral bank pr and doral bank ny  but they are not directly applicable to bank holding companies  such as doral financial  which control such institutions 
however  federal banking agencies have indicated that  in regulating bank holding companies  they may take appropriate action at the holding company level based on their assessment of the effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary insured depository institutions pursuant to such provisions and regulations

for purposes of the riegle neal act amendments to the fdia  doral bank pr is treated as a state bank and is subject to the same restrictions on interstate branching as other state banks 
however  for purposes of the international banking act the iba  doral bank pr is considered to be a foreign bank and may branch interstate by merger or de novo to the same extent as a domestic bank in doral bank pr s home state 
because doral bank pr does not currently operate in the mainland united states  it has not designated a home state for purposes of the iba 
it is not yet possible to determine how these statutes will be harmonized  with respect either to which federal agency will approve interstate transactions or with respect to which home state determination rules will apply

in addition  it granted a one time initial assessment credit of approximately billion to recognize institutions past contributions to the fund 

table of contents as mentioned above  on october   the president of the united states signed eesa  which among other things  temporarily raised the basic limit on fdic deposit insurance from  to  the temporary increase in deposit insurance became effective on october   with the president s signature of the eesa  and ends on december  under the reform act  the fdic made significant changes to its risk based assessment system so that effective january   the fdic imposes insurance premiums based upon a matrix that is designed to more closely tie what banks pay for deposit insurance to the risks they pose 
the new fdic risk based assessment system imposes premiums based upon factors that vary depending upon the size of the bank 
these factors are for banks with less than billion in assets capital level  supervisory rating  and certain financial ratios  for banks with billion up to billion in assets capital level  supervisory rating  certain financial ratios and if at least one is available debt issuer ratings  and additional risk information  and for banks with over billion in assets capital level  supervisory rating  debt issuer ratings unless none are available in which case certain financial ratios are used  and additional risk information 
the fdic has adopted a new base schedule of rates that the fdic can adjust up or down  depending on the revenue needs of the dif  and set initial premiums for that range from cents to cents per of domestic deposits for the banks in the lowest risk category  cents per of domestic deposits for the banks in the second risk category  cents per of domestic deposits for the banks in the third risk category to cents per of domestic deposits for banks in the fourth and highest risk category 
the new assessment system is expected to result in increased annual assessments on the deposits of doral financial s banking subsidiaries of to basis points per of deposits 
doral financial s banking subsidiaries have available an fdic credit to offset future assessments 
significant increases in the insurance assessments of our bank subsidiaries will increase our costs once the credit is fully utilized 
the aforementioned assessment rates that were established by the fdic commencing on january  remained in effect unchanged for and as a result of the substantial increase in bank failures in as well as the deterioration in banking and economic conditions  which have significantly increased the deposit insurance fund s losses and provisions for future losses  the fdic announced that the dif s reserve ratio measured by dividing the amount of available funds in the dif by the total amount of insured deposits in all fdic insured depository institutions had fallen below 
on these circumstances  the reform act requires that the fdic adopt a restoration plan to restore the dif s reserve ratio to within five years  unless the fdic determines that there are extraordinary circumstances 
on october   the fdic published a proposed rule that would implement such restoration plan 
the proposed rule would implement i a substantial increase to the base assessment rates  and ii other changes to the assessment system primarily to ensure that riskier institutions will bear a greater share of the proposed increase in assessments 
the proposed changes to the assessment system to ensure that riskier institutions pay a greater share would involve adjustments to an institution s base rate based on the following i a possible decrease in assessment rate based on the institution s ratio of long term unsecured debt to domestic deposits  ii a possible increase in assessment rate based on the institution s ratio of secured debt to domestic deposits  and iii a possible increase in assessment rate based on the institution s ratio of brokered deposits to domestic deposits and its related asset growth 
on december   the fdic published a final rule that sets the new assessment rates for the first quarter of the final rule implemented an across the board increase of cents per of domestic deposits 
the assessment rates for the first quarter of now range from cents to cents per of domestic deposits for the banks in the lowest risk category  cents per of domestic deposits for the banks in the second risk category  cents per of domestic deposits for the banks in the third risk category to cents per of domestic deposits for banks in the fourth and highest risk category 
the increase in assessment rates is expected to result in higher assessments on the deposits of doral financial s banking subsidiaries of to basis points per of deposits  which is an increase of more than when compared to the previous assessment range of to basis points 
this initial increase will translate into a projected increase of approximately million in the annual assessments to be paid by doral financial s banking subsidiaries during 
table of contents the fdic also noted that the other proposed changes to the assessment system would be implemented in a final rule expected to be published in early and which would be effective in april  on february   the fdic announced that it had adopted the final rule that would make changes to the risk assessment system and set assessment rates as of april  the new base assessment rates commencing with the second quarter of now will range from cents to cents per of domestic deposits for the banks in the lowest risk category  cents per of domestic deposits for the banks in the second risk category  cents per of domestic deposits for the banks in the third risk category  and cents per of domestic deposits for the banks in the fourth and highest risk category 
as mentioned above  there are additional adjustments to an institution s base rate to make sure that the riskier institutions pay a greater share 
the possible adjustments to the base rate involve the following i a possible decrease from to basis points based on the institution s ratio of long term unsecured debt to domestic deposits  ii a possible increase from to basis points the range of possible increase is larger based on the institution s risk category based on the institution s ratio of secured debt to domestic deposits  and iii a possible adjustment from to basis points there is no adjustment for institutions in the lowest risk category based on the institution s ratio of brokered deposits to domestic deposits and its related asset growth 
after all possible adjustments are taken into account  the new assessments for banks commencing in the second quarter of could fall in the following ranges i from cents to cents per of domestic deposits for the banks in the lowest risk category  ii from cents to cents per of domestic deposits for the banks in the second risk category  iii from cents to cents per of domestic deposits for the banks in the third risk category  and iv from cents to cents per of domestic deposits for the banks in the fourth and highest risk category 
in addition  the fdic announced on february  an interim rule pursuant to which it would be imposing an emergency special assessment of cents per of domestic deposits for all banks to be collected on september  the assessment base for the emergency special assessment would be the same as the assessment base for the second quarter risk based assessment 
the fdic stated that this emergency special assessment is being imposed because recent and anticipated failures of banks have significantly increased losses to the dif  resulting in a large decline in the dif s reserve ratio  which has reached its lowest level since in addition  the fdic s interim rule provides the fdic with authority to impose additional emergency special assessments of up to basis points if at the end of any quarter the fdic determines that the dif s reserve ratio has fallen close to zero or negative 
the deposit insurance funds act of also separated the financing corporation assessment to service the interest on its bond obligations from the bif and saif assessments

the ibc act and the regulations issued thereunder by the office of the commissioner limit the business activities that may be carried out in an ibe 
such activities are generally limited to persons and assets located outside of puerto rico 
the ibc act provides that every ibe must have not less than  in unencumbered assets or acceptable financial securities in puerto rico 
certain regulatory restrictions on investments in common stock because of doral financial s status as a bank holding company  owners of doral financial s common stock are subject to certain restrictions and disclosure obligations under various federal laws  including the bhc act 
regulations pursuant to the bhc act generally require prior federal reserve approval for an acquisition of control of an insured institution as defined or holding company thereof by any person or persons acting in concert 
control is deemed to exist if  among other things  a person or persons acting in concert acquires more than of any class of voting stock of an insured institution or holding company thereof 
control is presumed to exist subject to rebuttal  if a person or persons acting in concert acquires more than of any class of voting stock and either i the company has registered securities under section of the exchange act  or ii no person will own  control or hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction 
the concept of acting in concert is very broad and also is subject to certain rebuttable presumptions  including among others  that relatives  business partners  management officials  affiliates and others are presumed to be acting in concert with each other and their businesses 
section of the banking law requires the prior approval of the office of the commissioner with respect to a transfer of voting stock of a bank that results in a change of control of the bank 
under section  a change of control is presumed to occur if a person or group of persons acting in concert  directly or indirectly  acquires more than of the outstanding voting capital stock of the bank 
the office of the commissioner has interpreted the restrictions of section as applying to acquisitions of voting securities of entities controlling a bank  such as a bank holding company 
under the banking law  the determination of the office of the commissioner whether to approve a change of control filing is final and non appealable 

table of contents the provisions of the mortgage banking law also require regulatory approval for the acquisition of more than of doral financial s outstanding voting securities 
please refer to regulation and supervision mortgage origination and servicing above 
the above regulatory restrictions relating to investment in doral financial may have the effect of discouraging takeover attempts against doral financial and may limit the ability of persons  other than doral financial directors duly authorized by doral financial s board of directors  to solicit or exercise proxies  or otherwise exercise voting rights  in connection with matters submitted to a vote of doral financial s stockholders 
insurance operations doral insurance agency is registered as a corporate agent and general agency with the office of the commissioner of insurance of puerto rico the commissioner of insurance 
doral insurance agency is subject to regulation by the commissioner of insurance relating to  among other things  licensing of employees  sales practices  charging of commissions and obligations to customers 
doral insurance agency is subject to supervision and examination by the commissioner of insurance 
changes to legislation or regulation changes to federal and local laws and regulations including changes in interpretation and enforcement can affect the operating environment of the company and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways 
from time to time  various legislative and regulatory proposals are introduced 
these proposals  if adopted  may change laws and regulations and the company s operating environment 
if adopted  some of these laws and regulations could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks  savings institutions  credit unions and other financial institutions 
the company cannot accurately predict whether those changes in laws and regulations will occur  and  if those changes occur  the ultimate effect they would have upon our financial condition or results of operations 
it is likely  however  that the current high level of enforcement and compliance related activities of federal and puerto rico authorities will continue and potentially increase 
for example  on february   president obama called for a sweeping overhaul of wall street regulations  saying that big changes were necessary to avoid a repeat of the recent financial crises 
it is not possible at this time to ascertain what changes will be proposed and finally adopted in connection with this proposed overhaul  and what effect  if any  these changes will have on the financial condition and results of operations of doral financial 
recent puerto rico legislation and regulatory developments on august   the governor of puerto rico signed into a law an amendment to the puerto rico notarial law pursuant to which the rules regarding the payment of the notarial tariff in public deeds includes  among other things  deeds to purchase real estate and deeds to constitute mortgages over real estate executed before a notary public in puerto rico were changed 
subject to certain limited exceptions  the amendment makes mandatory the charging of the notarial tariff and prohibits any agreement that provides that any portion of the notarial tariff may be reduced  waived or credited to other legal services provided 
the required notarial tariff equals of the amount involved in the transaction up to a transaction amount of  and thereafter of of the amount involved in the transaction in excess of  up to a transaction amount of million 
this amendment has led to an increase of the closing costs and fees payable by persons involved in real estate purchase and mortgage loan transactions in puerto rico  which in turn may lead to a reduction in the number of real estate purchase and mortgage loan transactions in puerto rico 
in addition  this amendment may further make mortgage loan refinancings in puerto rico less sensitive to interest rate changes than mortgage loan refinancings in the united states 
law number of december  as later amended  law was enacted in puerto rico to provide tax incentives for certain housing unit purchases in order to stimulate the puerto rico construction industry and the puerto rico economy 
law provided tax credits to financial institutions in connection 
table of contents with their financing of the following housing unit purchase transactions i in connection with the purchase from a developer by an individual of a housing unit of new construction  a tax credit equal to of the sales price of the housing unit up to a maximum credit of ii in connection with the purchase from a developer by an individual of a housing unit of new construction that will be his or her principal residence must be owned and used as such for a period of at least years  a tax credit equal to of the sales price of the housing unit up to a maximum credit of  and iii in connection with the purchase from an existing owner by an individual of an existing housing unit  a tax credit equal to of the sales price of the housing unit up to a maximum credit of  in order to qualify for the credit  a financial institution had to i reduce the amount of the credit to be received from the principal amount owed by the borrower under the mortgage loan provided in connection with the qualifying housing purchase  and ii submit a credit request form to the puerto rico treasury department together with certain additional documents and information 
law provides that once the financial institution had filed all of the required information  the puerto rico treasury department secretary had a period of days to approve or deny the credit request  and that the credit would be approved if the puerto rico treasury department secretary failed to act within the day period 
the tax credits granted to financial institutions would be available for use to offset their income taxes in three installments i the first installment being from january  to june   ii the second installment being from july  to december   and iii the third installment being from january  to june  the tax credits were freely transferable by the financial institutions  and the financial institutions could request a refund from the puerto rico treasury department if the tax credits could not be used or transferred within the time periods provided 
law established the following limitations in connection with the tax credit program i in the case of housing units of new construction  the developers had to comply with certain requirements relating to qualifying the housing units available for sale under the tax credit program with the puerto rico department of consumer affairs  ii in the case of the existing housing units  the owners interested in participating in the program had to qualify their units with the puerto rico department of consumer affairs  and the total number of existing housing units that could be qualified was limited to iii the purchase transaction of the new or existing housing units had to be completed on or before december   and iv the total amount of the tax credits available under law could not exceed million 
on december   the puerto rico treasury department secretary notified puerto rico financial institutions that the total amount of tax credits of million available under law had been exhausted  and therefore no additional credits could be issued to financial institutions 
based on the fact that the puerto rico treasury department had not given sufficient advance notice of the fact that the amount of the tax credits was close to being exhausted  various puerto rico financial institutions  including doral financial  had closed mortgage loans in which the amount of the mortgage loan was reduced based on the expectation that the corresponding tax credit would be received once the required documentation was filed 
in the case of doral financial  it had closed a total of qualified mortgage loans that would have been eligible for additional tax credits in the amount of million if the tax credits under law had not been exhausted 

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
the following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could materially affect doral financial s results of operations and financial condition 
other factors that could affect doral financial s business and operations are discussed in the forward looking statements section of this annual report on form k 
however  factors besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this or other of doral financial s reports filed with or furnished to the sec  also could adversely affect doral financial 
the reader should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect doral financial 
risks relating to doral financial s business there can be no assurance that the actions of the us government  us federal reserve  us treasury and other government and regulatory bodies for the purpose of stabilizing the us financial markets  or market response to those actions  will achieve the intended effect 
on october   the president of the united states signed into law the eesa 
the legislation was the result of a proposal by then treasury secretary henry paulson to the us congress on september   in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions 
the eesa provides the us treasury secretary with the authority to use up to billion to  among other things  inject capital into financial institutions and establish the troubled asset relief program  or tarp  to purchase mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purposes of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
on october   the us treasury secretary announced a plan to use up to billion of the billion approved under the eesa to purchase senior preferred shares in financial institutions  including nine of the nation s largest banks 
the president of the united states also granted authority for the us treasury secretary to get access to an additional billion of the billion approved under the eesa to buy difficult to price assets from financial institutions  bringing the total commitment under eesa to billion 
on november   then treasury secretary paulson announced that the us treasury department was abandoning its original strategy to purchase troubled assets from financial institutions through the use of tarp funds under the eesa 
in january  the united states congress effectively released the remaining billion of tarp funds to the new obama administration 
on february   treasury secretary timothy geithner put forward a general description of a new financial stability plan  including a revised approach to tarp 
the new financial stability plan may commit in excess of trillion  from a combination of the remaining billion in tarp funds  federal reserve funds and private sector investments 
the new financial stability plan includes i new capital injections into banks than undergo a comprehensive stress test and need an additional capital buffer to help absorb losses  ii a new public private investment fund to be started by the us treasury department  along with the federal reserve and the fdic  to assist in disposition of illiquid assets in the balance sheets of financial institutions the plan initially seeks to leverage private capital with public funds on an initial scale of billion  but potentially up to trillion  iii an expansion of the previously announced talf program from billion to trillion and the inclusion in such program of commercial mortgage backed securities  and iv the commitment of billion from the tarp for foreclosure mitigation programs this is part of a much broader foreclosure mitigation program included in the homeowner affordability and stability plan discussed below 
on february   president obama announced the administration s homeowner affordability and stability plan that is designed to  among other things  assist homeowners unable to refinance their loans or struggling to meet their mortgage obligations 
the proposed homeowner affordability and stability plan seeks to help these homeowners by providing i access for borrowers to low cost refinancing on conforming loans owned or guaranteed by fnma or fhlmc  ii a billion homeowner stability initiative to prevent foreclosures  and iii additional commitments allowing the us treasury department to purchase up to an additional billion of preferred stock of fnma and fhlmc and allowing fnma and fhlmc to increase the size of their retained mortgage portfolios by billion 
the 
table of contents billion homeowner stability proposal includes financial incentives to borrowers and servicers in connection with loan modifications  the development of national standards for loan modifications  and support for the modification of bankruptcy laws to allow bankruptcy judges to modify residential mortgage loans 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the actual impact that the eesa and the new financial stability plan will have on the financial markets  including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability being experienced 
the failure of the eesa and the new financial stability plan to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  or access to credit 
in addition  the us government  the federal reserve  the us treasury department  the fdic and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken  or are considering taking  other actions to address the financial crisis 
we cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur or what impact  if any  such actions could have on our business  financial condition  results to operations  or access to credit 
current levels of market volatility are unprecedented 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than months 
during the second half of  the volatility and disruption reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect  which may be material  on our ability to access credit and on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the soundness of other financial institutions could affect us 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty and other relationships 
we have exposure to different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  investment companies and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  in certain of these transactions we are required to post collateral to secure our obligations to the counterparties 
in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving one of such counterparties  we may experience delays in recovering our assets posted as collateral or may incur a loss to the extent that the counterparty was holding collateral in excess of our obligation to such counterparty 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a loss may have to be accrued by doral financial with respect to a pending lehman brothers  inc claim 
doral financial and doral bank pr combined doral  had counterparty exposure to lehman brothers  inc lbi in connection with repurchase financing agreements and forward tba to be announced agreements 
lbi was placed in a sipc liquidation proceeding after the filing for bankruptcy of its parent lehman brothers holding inc the filing of the sipc liquidation proceeding was an event of default under the repurchase agreements and the forward agreements resulting in their termination as of september  
table of contents the termination of the agreements led to a reduction in the company s total assets and total liabilities of approximately million 
the termination of the agreements caused doral to recognize a previously unrealized loss on the value of the securities subject to the agreements  resulting in a million charge during the third quarter of doral filed a claim with the sipc trustee for lbi that it is owed approximately million  representing the excess of the value of the securities held by lbi above the amounts owed by doral under the agreements  plus ancillary expenses and damages 
doral has fully reserved ancillary expenses and interest 
in december  the sipc trustee announced that final submission of claims for customers was january and set a deadline of june for other creditor claims 
they also announced that they expect to have enough assets to cover customer claims but stated that they could not determine at this point what would be available to pay general creditors 
based on this information  doral determined that the process will likely take more than a year and that mounting legal and operating costs would likely impair the ability of lbi to pay of the claims  especially for general creditors 
the fourth quarter also saw the continued decline in asset values and management concluded that it was likely that lbi assets would also decline in value 
management evaluated this receivable in accordance with the guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  and related pronouncements 
as a result  doral accrued a loss of million against the million owed by lbi as of december  the net receivable of million is recorded in accounts receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
determining the reserve amount requires management to use considerable judgment and is based on the facts currently available 
as additional information on the sipc proceeding becomes available  doral may need to accrue further losses or reverse losses already accrued 
the actual loss that may ultimately be incurred by doral with respect to its pending lbi claim may have a significant adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
difficult market conditions have already affected our industry and may adversely affect us 
given that almost all of our business is in puerto rico and the united states and given the degree of interrelation between puerto rico s economy and that of the united states  we are particularly exposed to downturns in the us economy 
dramatic declines in the us housing market over the past year  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures  unemployment and under employment  have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities as well as major commercial banks and investment banks 
these write downs  initially of mortgage backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative and cash securities  in turn  have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital from private and government entities  to merge with larger and stronger financial institutions and  in some cases  fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of consumer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally 
the resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets has already adversely affected our industry and may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not expect that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are likely to improve in the near future 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry 
in particular  we may face the following risks in connection with these events we expect to face increased regulation of our industry  including as a result of the eesa and the new financial stability plan 
compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select  manage  and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future behaviors 
the processes we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  including forecast of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans  which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation and which may  in turn  impact the reliability of the processes 
our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in sales of mortgage loans to third parties including mortgage loan securitization transactions with government sponsored entities on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further 
table of contents disruptions in the capital markets or other events  including deteriorating investor expectations 
competition in our industry could intensify as a result of increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions 
the fdic has already increased the amount of the assessments that we will have to pay on our insured deposits during because market developments have led to a substantial increase in bank failures and an increase in fdic loss reserves  which in turn has led to a depletion of the insurance fund of the fdic and a reduction of the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
in addition  the fdic announced on february  an interim rule pursuant to which it would be imposing an emergency special assessment of cents per of domestic deposits for all banks to be collected on september  we may be required to pay in the future significantly higher fdic assessment on our deposits if market conditions do not improve or if market conditions deteriorate 
higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that either i reduces the amount that our borrowers are required to pay us  or ii limits our ability to foreclose on properties or collateral or makes foreclosures less economically viable 
in particular  there is legislation pending in the us congress that would allow a chapter bankruptcy plan to cram down the value of certain mortgages on a consumer s principal residence to its market value and or reset debtor interest rate and monthly payments to an amount that permits them to remain in their homes 
we have experienced declines in the market value of some of our assets 
some of our mortgage backed and other investments have experienced declines in their market values as a result of adverse market conditions 
a decline in the market value of our mortgage backed securities and other assets may require us to recognize an other than temporary impairment against such assets under gaap if we were to determine that  with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions  we do not have the ability and intent to hold assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of the amortized cost of such assets 
if such a determination were made  we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis  based on the fair market value of such assets on the date they are considered to be other than temporarily impaired 
such impairment charges reflect non cash losses at the time of recognition  subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains  as they are based on the difference between the sales price received and the adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale 
doral financial s business is concentrated in puerto rico and continued weakness of pr economy may continue to adversely affect doral financial 
doral financial s business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in puerto rico 
consequently  its financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on economic conditions in puerto rico 
adverse political or economic developments  decreases in housing values or natural disasters  such as hurricanes  could result in a downturn in loan originations  an increase in the level of non performing assets  an increase in the rate of foreclosure loss on mortgage loans and a reduction in the value of doral financial s loans and loan servicing portfolio 
since  the pr economy has been experiencing recessionary conditions 
based on information published by the puerto rico planning board on february   puerto rico real gross national product decreased during the fiscal year ended june  the preliminary figures for the fiscal year ended june  are that the puerto rico gross national product decreased by 
as reported by the puerto rico planning board  the growth deceleration during fiscal year constitutes the sharpest economic reduction since fiscal year the puerto rico planning board expects that recessionary conditions will continue in puerto rico during the fiscal years ending in june  and during fiscal year the projection is a reduction in real gross national product of  and during fiscal year the projection is a reduction in real gross national product of 

table of contents the continued adverse economic conditions in puerto rico  the recessionary conditions in the united states  as well as increased uncertainty in the credit and real estate markets may also have an adverse effect on the credit quality of the company s loan portfolios  as delinquency rates are expected to increase in the short term  until the economy stabilizes 
also  a potential reduction in consumer spending may also impact growth in other interest and non interest revenue sources of the company 
deteriorating credit quality particularly in real estate loans has adversely impacted doral financial and may continue to adversely impact doral financial 
doral financial has experienced a downturn in credit performances during and  and the company expects credit conditions and the performance of its loan portfolio to continue to deteriorate in the near future 
construction loans to finance residential or commercial projects involve greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans because they are larger in size  concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more sensitive to economic conditions 
the properties securing these loans are also harder to dispose of in foreclosure 
increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses may be necessary in the future 
accordingly  a decrease in the quality of doral financial s credit portfolio could have a material adverse effect on doral financial s earnings and results of operations 
changes in interest rates could affect doral financial s income and cash flows 
doral financial s income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest rates earned on interest earning assets such as loans and investment securities  and the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond doral financial s control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular  the federal reserve board 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  will influence the origination of loans  the prepayment speed of loans  the value of loans  investment securities and mortgage servicing assets  the purchase of investments  the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of funding 
the hedging transactions that the company enters into may not be effective in managing the exposure to interest rate risk 
the company uses derivatives  to a limited extent  to manage part of its exposure to market risk caused by changes in interest rates 
the derivative instruments that the company may use also have their own risks  which include i basis risk  which is the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and funding and or hedge cost  ii credit or default risk  which is the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations thereunder  and iii legal risk  which is the risk that the company is unable to enforce the terms of such instruments 
all or any of these risks could expose the company to losses 
our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk  which could negatively affect us 
management of risk requires  among other things  policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events 
we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future 
nonetheless  our policies and procedures may not be comprehensive given current market conditions 
some of our methods for managing risk and exposures are based upon the use of observed historical market behavior or statistics based on historical models 
as a result  these methods may not fully predict future exposures  which could be significantly greater than our historical measures indicate 
other risk management methods depend on the evaluation of information regarding markets  clients or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us 
this information may not always be accurate  complete  up to date or properly evaluated 

table of contents the preparation of doral financial s financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make significant estimates that affect doral financial s financial statements 
three of doral financial s most critical estimates are the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and the amount of its deferred tax asset 
due to the inherent nature of these estimates doral financial cannot provide absolute assurance that it will not significantly increase the allowance for loan and lease losses and or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance  nor that it will not recognize a significant provision for impairment of its mortgage servicing rights 
if doral financial s allowance for loan and lease losses is not adequate  doral financial s business  financial condition  including its liquidity and capital  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  in the future  doral financial may increase its allowance for loan and lease losses  which could have a material adverse effect on its capital and results of operations 
for more information on the sensitivity of these estimates  please refer to the critical accounting policies section in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this annual report on form k 
as of december   doral financial had a deferred tax asset of approximately million 
the deferred tax asset is net of a valuation allowance of million 
the realization of doral financial s deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income to realize the value of this asset 
due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances  it is reasonably possible that doral financial will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods 
doral financial s results of operations would be negatively impacted if it determines that increases to its deferred tax asset valuation allowance are required in a future reporting period 
for additional information on doral financial s deferred tax asset please refer to the information under the caption income taxes in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this annual report on form k 
defective and repurchased loans may harm doral financial s business and financial condition 
in connection with the sale and securitization of mortgage loans  doral financial is required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding the company and the loans being sold or securitized 
doral financial s obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan  and they relate to  among other things compliance with laws and regulations  underwriting standards  the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan file  and the characteristics and enforceability of the loan 
a loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell  may impact doral financial s ability to obtain third party financing for the loan  and be unsaleable or saleable only at a significant discount 
if such a loan is sold before doral financial detects a non compliance  doral financial may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly  or doral financial may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such loss  either of which could reduce doral financial s cash available for operations and liquidity 
the company s current management team believes that it has established controls to ensure that loans are originated in accordance with the secondary market s requirements  but no assurance can be given that mistakes will not be made  or that certain employees will not deliberately violate the company s lending policies 
doral financial seeks to minimize repurchases and losses from defective loans by correcting flaws  if possible  and selling or re selling such loans 
doral financial does not have a reserve on its financial statements for possible losses related to repurchases 
table of contents resulting from representation and warranty violations because it does not expect any such losses to be significant 
doral financial cannot assure however  that losses associated with defective loans will not adversely impact its results of operations or financial condition 
please refer to liquidity and capital resources under part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this annual report on form k 
doral financial is exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans held pending sale and mortgage loans that have been sold subject to recourse arrangements 
doral financial is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan until the time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage backed security 
in the past  doral financial retained  through recourse arrangements  part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans that did not qualify for gnma  fnma or fhlmc sale or exchange programs and consequently may suffer losses on these loans 
doral financial suffers losses on these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan and the costs of holding and disposing of the related property 
doral financial is subject to risks in servicing loans for others 
doral financial s profitability may also be adversely affected by mortgage loan delinquencies and defaults on mortgage loans that it services for third parties 
under many of its servicing contracts  doral financial must advance all or part of the scheduled payments to the owner of an outstanding mortgage loan  even when mortgage loan payments are delinquent 
in addition  in order to protect their liens on mortgaged properties  owners of mortgage loans usually require that doral financial  as servicer  pay mortgage and hazard insurance and tax payments on schedule even if sufficient escrow funds are not available 
doral financial generally recovers its advances from the mortgage owner or from liquidation proceeds when the mortgage loan is foreclosed 
however  in the interim  doral financial must absorb the cost of the funds it advances during the time the advance is outstanding 
doral financial must also bear the costs of attempting to collect on delinquent and defaulted mortgage loans 
in addition  if a default is not cured  the mortgage loan will be canceled as part of the foreclosure proceedings and doral financial will not receive any future servicing income with respect to that loan 
unforeseen disruptions in the brokered deposits market could compromise doral financial s liquidity position 
a relatively large portion of doral financial s funding is retail brokered deposits issued by doral bank pr 
total brokered deposits as of december  for doral financial were billion 
an unforeseen disruption in the brokered deposits market  stemming from factors such as legal  regulatory or financial risks  could adversely affect doral financial s ability to fund a portion of its operations and or meet obligations 
adverse credit market conditions may affect doral financial s ability to meet its liquidity needs 
the credit markets have recently been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption 
in the second half of  the volatility and disruptions reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity of certain issuers 
doral financial needs liquidity to  among other things  pay its operating expenses  interest on its debt and dividends on its preferred stock  maintain its lending activities and replace certain maturing liabilities 
without sufficient liquidity  doral financial may be forced to curtail its operations 
the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit and doral financial s credit capacity 
doral financial s cash flows and financial condition could be materially affected by continued disruptions in the financial markets 

table of contents doral financial may fail to retain and attract key employees and management personnel 
doral financial s success has been and will continue to be influenced by its ability to retain and attract key employees and management personnel  including senior and middle management 
doral financial s ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel may be adversely affected as a result of the workload and stress associated with the resolution of legacy issues and business transformation efforts  and related risks and uncertainties 
competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect the profitability of doral financial s operations 
doral financial faces significant competition from other financial institutions  many of which have significantly greater assets  capital and other resources 
as a result  many of doral financial s competitors have advantages in conducting certain businesses and providing certain services 
this competitive environment could force doral financial to increase the rates it offers on deposits or lower the rates it charges on loans and  consequently  could adversely affect the profitability of doral financial s operations

management believes  based on the 
table of contents opinion of legal counsel  that the aggregated liabilities  if any  arising from such actions will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of doral financial

plaintiff seeks an award of damages  costs and expenses 
all defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint as amended  and such motions have not been decided 
on march   the plaintiff and the defendants entered into a settlement agreement to dismiss the case in exchange for the defendants agreeing not to seek attorneys fees and costs from the plaintiff 
the case was dismissed with prejudice on march  in addition  on october   the company and certain former officers and directors of the company were named as defendants in an action brought by an individual plaintiff filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york  alleging violations of federal securities laws and various kentucky state laws based on making allegedly materially false and misleading statements concerning doral s financial results  allegedly failing to disclose material information concerning the valuation of the company s ios  and allegedly misleading the plaintiff as to the company s vulnerability to interest rate increases

this service provider was requesting payment of its monthly service charges and its investment in equipment and software to perform the data processing service agreement it entered into with the company which totaled approximately million 
this action was settled during the third quarter of management had previously reserved for this action  therefore there was no adverse effect on the company s financial statements as a result of the settlement for the year ended december  other legal matters on august   the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york served doral financial with a grand jury subpoena seeking the production of certain documents relating to issues arising from the restatement  including financial statements and corporate  auditing and accounting records prepared during the period from january  to the date of the subpoena

lehman brothers transactions doral financial corporation and doral bank pr combined doral  had counterparty exposure to lehman brothers  inc lbi in connection with repurchase financing agreements and forward tba to be announced agreements 
lbi was placed in a securities investor protection corporation 
table of contents sipc liquidation proceeding after the filing for bankruptcy of its parent lehman brothers holdings  inc the filing of the sipc liquidation proceeding was an event of default under the repurchase agreements and the forward agreements resulting in their termination as of september  the termination of the agreements led to a reduction in the company s total assets and total liabilities of approximately million 
the termination of the agreements caused doral to recognize a previously unrealized loss on the value of the securities subject to the agreements  resulting in a million charge during the third quarter of doral filed a claim with the sipc trustee for lbi that it is owed approximately million  representing the excess of the value of the securities held by lbi above the amounts owed by doral under the agreements  plus ancillary expenses and damages 
doral has fully reserved ancillary expenses and interest 
in december  the sipc trustee announced that final submission of claims for customers was january and set a deadline of june for other creditor claims 
they also announced that they expect to have enough assets to cover customer claims but stated that they could not determine at this point what would be available to pay general creditors 
based on this information  doral determined that the process will likely take more than a year and that mounting legal and operating costs would likely impair the ability of lbi to pay of the claims  especially for general creditors 
the fourth quarter also saw the continued decline in asset values and management concluded that it was likely that lbi assets would also decline in value 
management evaluated this receivable in accordance with the guidance provided by sfas  and related pronouncements 
as a result  doral accrued a loss of million against the million owed by lbi as of december  the net receivable of million is recorded in accounts receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
determining the reserve amount requires management to use considerable judgment and is based on the facts currently available 
as additional information on the sipc proceeding becomes available  doral may need to accrue further losses or reverse losses already accrued 
the actual loss that may ultimately be incurred by doral with respect to its pending lbi claim may have a significant adverse impact on the company s results of operations

the decrease in the provision is mostly driven by a reduction of million in delinquencies in the company s construction loan portfolio during which has attributed to higher losses in recent years  partially offset by the impact of increased delinquencies in the company s residential mortgage and commercial loan portfolios 
non performing loans as of december  increased by million  or  compared to december   while they increased by million  or  in the corresponding preceding period 
non interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to non interest loss of million and million in and  respectively 
non interest income performance for the year ended december   compared to  was primarily driven by i an increase of million in gain on mortgage loans sales and fees  principally related to the increase of million in loan sales and securitization  ii an increase of million in income from trading activities principally related to the company s us treasury investments which serve as an economic hedge to the company s mark to market risk in its mortgage servicing rights and to positive marks related to the company s io investments  iii a million reduction in losses from investment securities principally related to a significant charge in associated with the company s balance sheet restructuring which was partially

non interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
compared to  the reduction of million  or  in non interest expenses for was driven by the elimination of expenses associated with recapitalization and reorganization efforts and the cost control measures implemented by the company during the elimination of expenses and cost control measures impacted principally expenses associated with compensation and benefits by million and professional services by million 
these reductions were partially offset by a provision for claim receivable of million and increases in the company s communication expenses of million  mainly associated to an increase in fee income of million in ath and visa debit card activity 
for the year ended december   doral financial reported an income tax expense of million  compared to an income tax benefit of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the recognition of an income tax expense for was related to the increase of million in the valuation allowance driven by the fact that  in the fourth quarter of  the company was unable to meet the projected income  due primarily to a reduction in net interest income and increases in the provision for loan and lease losses 
during the fourth quarter of  the company took action which prioritized safety of principal and liquidity over returns causing a drop in its net interest income which contributed in a fourth quarter pre tax loss 
for the year ended december   the company had other comprehensive loss of approximately million  compared to other comprehensive income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the other comprehensive loss for the year ended december  was mainly driven by the reduction in value of the company s private label cmo s as a result of the price movement on these securities that has been affected by the conditions of the us financial markets  specially the non agency mortgage market 
other comprehensive income recognized during resulted from the realization of the losses reflected in the company s accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income tax benefit at december   as a result of the sale of the billion in available for sale investment securities during the third quarter of as of december   the company s accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income tax benefit was million  compared to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
doral financial s loan production for the year ended december  was billion  compared to billion for the production remained steady during when compared to the lack of growth in doral financial s loan production for was primarily the result of i tighter commercial and consumer underwriting standards  ii the decision to cease financing construction of new housing projects in puerto rico  and iii changes in laws and regulations  such as the recent amendment to the puerto rico notary law that led to an increase of the closing costs and fees payable by persons involved in real estate purchase and mortgage loan transactions in puerto rico  which in turn led to a reduction in the number of real estate purchase and mortgage loan transactions in puerto rico 

table of contents total assets as of december  were billion  compared to billion as of december  the increase in total assets during was principally due to an increase in the company s securities portfolio of billion as a result of a company s plan to increase its earning assets by billion during the increase in assets was partially offset by a reduction of million in money markets and securities purchased under agreements to resell and million in the deferred tax asset 
total liabilities as of december  were billion  compared to billion as of december  the increase in liabilities resulted from the increase in borrowings used to finance the purchase of the securities 
during the third quarter of  the company reduced its assets and liabilities by billion  associated with the termination of repurchase financing arrangements and the sale of collateral associated with such financing arrangements with lehman brothers  inc lbi as a result of the sipc liquidation proceedings as of september  internal control over financial reporting doral financial undertook the remediation efforts that were set forth in in order to remedy the material weakness in its internal controls identified as of december  doral financial s remediation efforts are outlined in remediation efforts of material weakness that existed as of december  under item a  controls and procedures  of this annual report on form k 
as a result of its assessment  management has concluded that the company s internal control over financial reporting is effective as of december  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make a number of judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  income and expenses in doral financial s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain of these estimates are critical to the presentation of doral financial s financial condition since they are particularly sensitive to the company s judgment and are highly complex in nature 
doral financial believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances as of december  however  given the sensitivity of doral financial s consolidated financial statements to these estimates  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in doral financial s results of operations or financial condition 
various elements of doral financial s accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
note to doral financial s consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the most significant accounting policies followed by doral financial in the preparation of its financial statements 
the accounting policies that have a significant impact on doral financial s statements and that require the most judgment are set forth below 
fair value measurements pursuant to sfas  the company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures 
securities held for trading  securities available for sale  derivatives and servicing assets are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  the company may be required to record at fair value other financial assets on a nonrecurring basis  such as loans held for sale  loans receivable and certain other assets 
these nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve the application of the lower of cost or market accounting or write downs of individual assets 
the company adopted sfas no 
on january  sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures requirements for fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset 
table of contents or paid to transfer a financial liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
sfas no 
established a three level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 
the classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable 
observable inputs reflect market derived or market based information obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect the company s estimates about market data 
level valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets 
level valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market  or are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data  by correlation or by other means 
level valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market 
these unobservable assumptions reflect the company s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
valuation techniques include use of option pricing models  discounted cash flow models and similar techniques 
in accordance with sfas no 
 doral financial s intent is to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements 
when available  the company uses quoted market prices to measure fair value 
if market prices are not available  fair value measurements are based upon models that use primarily market based or independently sourced market parameters  including interest rate yield curves  prepayment speeds  option volatilities and currency rates 
substantially all of doral financial s financial instruments use either of the foregoing methodologies  collectively level and level measurements  to determine fair value adjustments recorded to the company s financial statements 
however  in certain cases  when market observable inputs for model based valuation techniques may not be readily available  the company is required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instruments 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters 
for financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters  there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value 
when observable market prices and parameters are not fully available  management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
in addition  changes in the market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data 
for example  reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable 
therefore  when market data is not available  the company uses valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement 
the discussion about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the valuation methodologies used and its impact on earnings is included in note of doral financial consolidated financial statements 
gain or loss on mortgage loan sales the company generally securitizes a portion of the residential mortgage loans that it originates 
fha and va loans are generally securitized into gnma mortgage backed securities and held as trading securities 
after holding these securities for a period of time  doral financial sells these securities for cash 
conforming conventional loans are generally sold directly to fnma  fhlmc or institutional investors or exchanged for fnma or fhlmc issued mortgage backed securities  which doral financial sells for cash 
table of contents through broker dealers 
prior to  the company sold mortgage loans that did not conform to gnma  fnma or fhlmc requirements non conforming loans as whole loan pools to financial institutions 
as part of its mortgage loan sale and securitization activities  doral financial generally retains the right to service the mortgage loans it sells 
in connection with the sale of loans  generally non conforming mortgage loan pools  doral financial may also retain certain interests in the loans sold  such as the right to receive any interest payments on such loans above the contractual pass through rate payable to the investor 
doral financial determines the gain on sale of a mortgage backed security or loan pool by allocating the carrying value of the underlying mortgage loans between the mortgage backed security or mortgage loan pool sold and its retained interests  based on their relative estimated fair values 
the gain on sale reported by doral financial is the difference between the proceeds received from the sale and the cost allocated to the loans sold 
the proceeds include cash and other assets received in the transaction primarily msrs less any liabilities incurred ie  representations and warranty provisions 
the reported gain or loss is the difference between the proceeds from the sale of the security or mortgage loan pool and its allocated cost 
the amount of gain on sale is therefore influenced by the values of the msrs and retained interest recorded at the time of sale 
see retained interest valuation below for additional information 
if in a transfer of financial assets in exchange for cash or other consideration other than beneficial interests in transferred assets  doral financial has not surrendered control over the transferred assets according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas  doral financial accounts for the transfer as a secured borrowing loan payable with a pledge of collateral 
retained interest valuation in the past  doral financial s sale and securitization activities generally resulted in the recording of one or two types of retained interests  msrs and ios 
during  the company s sale and securitization activities resulted in the recording of only one type of retained interest  msrs 
msrs represent the estimated present value of the normal servicing fees net of related servicing costs expected to be received on a loan being serviced over the expected term of the loan 
msrs entitle doral financial to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balance of the loans serviced and the contractual servicing fee 
the annual servicing fees generally range between and basis points  less  in certain cases  any corresponding guarantee fee 
in addition  msrs may entitle doral financial  depending on the contract language  to ancillary income including late charges  float income  and prepayment penalties net of the appropriate expenses incurred for performing the servicing functions 
in certain instances  the company also services loans with no contractual servicing fee 
the servicing asset or liability associated with such loans is evaluated based on ancillary income  including float  late fees  prepayment penalties and costs 
msrs are classified as servicing assets in doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
any servicing liability recognized is included as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities in doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
unlike us treasury and agency mortgage backed securities  the fair value of msrs and ios cannot be readily determined because they are not traded in active securities markets 
doral financial engages third party specialists to assist with its valuation of the company s entire servicing portfolio governmental  conforming and non conforming portfolios 
the fair value of the msrs is determined based on a combination of market information on trading activity msrs trades and broker valuations  benchmarking of servicing assets valuation surveys and cash flow modeling 
the valuation of the company s msrs incorporate two sets of assumptions market derived assumptions for discount rates  servicing costs  escrow earnings rate  float earnings rate and cost of funds and market derived assumptions adjusted for the company s loan characteristics and portfolio behavior  for escrow balances  delinquencies and foreclosures  late fees  prepayments and prepayment penalties 
for the year ended december   the msrs fair value amounted to million  which represents a value decline of million compared to december  the company  upon remeasurement of the msrs at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for servicing of financial assets  recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of million to 
table of contents retained earnings net of tax on january  for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount to bring the december  msr balance to the fair value 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
in  impairment charges were recognized through a valuation allowance for each individual stratum of servicing assets 
the valuation allowance was adjusted to reflect the amount  if any  by which the cost basis of the servicing asset for a given stratum of loans being serviced exceeded its fair value 
any fair value in excess of the cost basis of the servicing asset for a given stratum was not recognized 
other than temporary impairment  if any  was recognized as a direct write down of the servicing asset  and the valuation allowance was applied to reduce the cost basis of the servicing asset 
the amortization of the msrs was based on an income forecast cash flow method 
the income forecast method was based on the forecasted cash flows determined by the third party market valuation and the amortization was calculated by applying to the carrying amount of the msrs the ratio of the cash flows projected for the current period to total remaining forecasted cash flow 
the company s msr values experienced a reduction of over during the generalized drop in msr values was mainly driven by increases in projected prepayments speeds 
consistent with this market trend  prepayment speeds for the company s msr collateral were increased by more than basis points during the generalized increase in prepayment speeds was largely due to a decline in the level of interest rates 
reductions in the general level interest rates were concentrated in the fourth quarter of  after ten consecutive reductions in fed targets pushed the fed fund rate close to zero and the flight to quality to us treasuries caused long term interest rates to fall which resulted in increased expectations of a mortgage refinancing transactions 
secondary components of the drop in msr carrying values were a reduction of million in unpaid principal balance of msr underlying mortgages  and reduction in forecasted float and ancillary income caused by lower interest rates 
the valuation of the company s msr is also impacted by changes in laws and regulations  such as the recent amendment to the puerto rico notary law that led to an increase of the closing costs and fees payable by persons involved in real estate purchase and mortgage loan transactions in puerto rico  which in turn has led to a reduction in the number of real estate purchase and mortgage loan transaction in puerto rico 
the result was a partial tempering of refinancing transactions 
ios represent the estimated present value of the cash flows retained by the company that are generated by the underlying fixed rate mortgages as adjusted for prepayments after subtracting the interest rate payable to the investor adjusted for any embedded cap  if applicable  and a contractual servicing fee 
as of december   the carrying value of the ios of million is related to million of outstanding principal balance of mortgage loans sold to investors 
ios are classified as securities held for trading in doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
to determine the value of its portfolio of variable ios  doral financial uses an internal valuation model that forecasts expected cash flows using forward libor rates derived from the libor swap yield curve at the date of the valuation 
this characteristics of the variable ios results in an increase in cash flows when libor rates fall and a reduction in cash flows when libor rates rise 
this provides a mitigating effect on the impact of prepayment speeds on the cash flows  with prepayments expected to rise when long term interest rates fall reducing the amount of expected cash flows and the opposite when long term interest rise 
prepayment assumptions incorporated into the valuation model for variable and fixed ios are based on publicly available  independently verifiable  prepayment assumptions for fnma mortgage pools and statistically derived prepayment adjusters based on observed relationships between the company s and the fnma s us mainland mortgage pool prepayment experiences 
this methodology resulted in a cpr of for  for and for the change in the cpr between and was due mostly to a generalized decrease in market interest rates 
however  puerto rico prepayments speeds continue to be slower than us especially considering the persistence of recessionary conditions 

table of contents the io internal valuation model utilizes a z spread approach to determine discount rates 
the z spread is the market recognized spread over the libor swap curve that takes into consideration incremental yield requirements based on the risk characteristics of a particular instrument 
the z spread incorporates a premium for prepayment optionality and liquidity risk over the period end swap curve 
the company obtains fnma and fhlmc trust io z spread from major investment banking firms and combines along with base libor swap curve and liquidity premiums to generate discount rate assumptions for ios 
the market for agency trust ios showed mixed trends during  with trust ios with moderate collateral over performing seasoned collateral  for like coupon levels 
the net effect of z spread trends in was to push upward discount rates  given the seasoning mix of the company s io portfolio  which is predominantly composed by seasoned collateral 
as of december   the company determined that a basis points liquidity premium an increase of basis points versus the inputs was appropriate in order to set its discount rate within the range of discount rates used in the market for retained interest 
as of december   management conducted its evaluation of its liquidity premium and determined that a liquidity premium of basis points was appropriate for the period 
the resulting discount rate of reflected the range and movement of discount rates for retained interests observed in the marketplace 
this methodology resulted in a discount rate of for  for and for for ios  doral financial recognizes as interest income through the life of the io the excess of all estimated cash flows attributable to these interests over their recorded balance using the effective yield method in accordance with emerging issue task force eitf issue no 
recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
doral financial recognizes as interest income the excess of the cash collected from the borrowers over the yield payable to investors  less a servicing fee retained spread  up to an amount equal to the yield on the ios that equals the discount rate used in the internal valuation model 
doral financial accounts for any excess retained spread as amortization to the gross io capitalized at inception 
the company updates its estimates of expected cash flows periodically and recognizes changes in calculated effective yield on a prospective basis 
the following table presents a detail of the cash flows received and the losses on the valuation of doral financial s portfolio of ios for  and based on the internal valuation model year ended december  in thousands total cash flows received on io portfolio amortization of ios  as offset to cash flows net cash flows recognized as interest income gain loss on the value of the ios as discussed above  doral financial classifies its ios as securities held for trading with changes in the fair value recognized in current earnings as a component of net gain loss on securities held for trading 

table of contents the following table shows the weighted averages of the key economic assumptions used by the company in its external and internal valuation models and the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate and adverse changes in those assumptions for mortgage loans at december  servicing interest only assets strips dollars in thousands carrying amount of retained interest weighted average expected life in years constant prepayment rate weighted average annual rate decrease in fair value due to adverse change decrease in fair value due to adverse change residual cash flow discount rate weighted average annual rate decrease in fair value due to adverse change decrease in fair value due to adverse change these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on a percent variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  in the table above  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another for example  increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments  which may magnify or offset the sensitivities 
the following table summarizes the estimated change in the fair value of the company s ios  the constant prepayment rate and the weighted average expected life under the company s valuation model  given several hypothetical instantaneous and parallel increases or decreases in interest rates 
as of december   all of the mortgage loan sale contracts underlying the company s floating rate ios were subject to interest rate caps  which prevent a negative fair value for the floating rate ios 
constant weighted average change in fair change in interest prepayment expected life value of interest rates basis points rate years only strips change dollars in thousands base the company s ios included in the table above are primarily variable rate ios  subject to interest rate caps 
accordingly  in a declining interest rate scenario as shown in the table  decreases in the fair value of the interest rate caps only partially offsets the positive impact that declining interest rates would have on the fair values of the ios 
this results in net increases in the fair values of the ios 
valuation of trading securities and derivatives doral financial s net gain loss on securities held for trading includes gains and losses  whether realized or unrealized  on securities accounted for as held for trading  including ios  as well as various other financial instruments  including derivative contracts  that doral financial uses to manage its interest rate risk 
securities held for trading and derivatives are recorded at fair values with increases or decreases in such values reflected in current earnings 
the fair values of many of doral financial s trading securities other than ios are based on market prices obtained from renowned market data sources  such as bloomberg llp and interactive data corporation 
for instruments not traded on a recognized market  doral financial generally determines fair value by reference to quoted market prices for similar instruments 
the fair values of derivative instruments are obtained using internal valuation models based on renowned financial modeling tools and using market derived assumptions obtained from bloomberg llp 
securities accounted as held for trading includes us treasury security positions  taken as economic hedges against the valuation adjustment of the company s capitalized mortgage servicing rights 

table of contents generally  derivatives are financial instruments with little or no initial net investment in comparison to their notional amount and whose value is based on the value of an underlying asset  index  reference rate or other variable 
they may be standardized contracts executed through organized exchanges or privately negotiated contractual agreements that can be customized to meet specific needs  including certain commitments to purchase and sell mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
the fair value of derivatives is generally reported net by counterparty  provided that a legally enforceable master agreement exists 
derivatives in a net asset position are reported as part of securities held for trading  at fair value 
similarly  derivatives in a net liability position are reported as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities  at fair value 
for those derivatives not designated as an accounting hedge  fair value gains and losses are reported as part of net gain loss on securities held for trading in the consolidated statements of loss 
other income recognition policies interest income on loans is accrued by doral financial when earned 
loans are placed on a non accrual basis when any portion of principal or interest is more than days past due  or earlier if concern exists as to the ultimate collectibility of principal or interest 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  all accrued but unpaid interest to date is fully reversed 
such interest  if collected  is credited to income in the period of recovery 
loans return to accrual status when principal and interest become current and are anticipated to be fully collectible 
loan origination fees  as well as discount points and certain direct origination costs for loans held for sale  are initially recorded as an adjustment to the cost of the loan and reflected in doral financial s earnings as part of the net gain on mortgage loan sales and fees when the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage backed security 
in the case of loans held for investment  such fees and costs are deferred and amortized to income as adjustments to the yield of the loan in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
allowance for loan and lease losses doral financial maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses to absorb probable credit related losses on its loans receivable portfolio 
the allowance consists of specific and general components and is based on doral financial s assessment of default probabilities  internal risk ratings based on borrowers financial stability  external credit ratings  management strength  earnings and operating environment  probable loss and recovery rates  and the degree of risks inherent in the loans receivable portfolio 
the allowance is maintained at a level that doral financial considers to be adequate to absorb probable losses 
credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the allowance  while increases to the allowance are charged to operations 
unanticipated increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses could adversely impact doral financial s net income in the future 
the company evaluates impaired loans and the related valuation allowance based on sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
doral financial measures impaired loans at their estimated realizable values determined by discounting the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  if practical  at the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
in assessing the reserves under the discounted cash flows  the company considers the estimate of future cash flows based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
all available evidence  including estimated costs to sell if those costs are expected to reduce the cash flows available to repay or otherwise satisfy the loan  are considered in developing those estimates 
the likelihood of the possible outcomes is considered in determining the best estimate of expected future cash flows 
doral financial s mortgage loan portfolio consists primarily of homogeneous loans that are secured by residential real estate and are made to consumers 
doral financial does not evaluate individual small balance homogeneous loans for impairment 
instead  it records an allowance including residential mortgages  consumer  commercial and construction loans under million on a group basis under the 
table of contents provisions of sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
for such loans  the allowance is determined considering the historical charge off experience of each loan category and delinquency levels as well as charge off and delinquency trends and economic data  such as interest rate levels  inflation and the strength of the housing market in the areas where the company operates 
the company engages in the restructuring of the debt of borrowers who are delinquent due to economic or legal reasons  if the company determines that it is in the best interest for both the company and the borrower to do so 
in some cases  due to the nature of the borrower s financial condition  the restructure or loan modification fits the definition of troubled debt restructuring tdr as defined by the sfas accounting by debtors and creditors of troubled debt restructurings 
such restructures are identified as tdrs and accounted for based on the provisions sfas estimated recourse obligation prior to  the company normally sold mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities subject to recourse provisions 
pursuant to these recourse arrangements  the company agreed to retain or share the credit risk with the purchaser of such mortgage loans for a specified period or up to a certain percentage of the total amount in loans sold 
the company estimates the fair value of the retained recourse obligation or any liability incurred at the time of sale and includes such obligation with the net proceeds from the sale  resulting in lower gain on sale recognition 
doral financial recognized the fair value of its recourse obligation by estimating the amount that the company would be required to pay for mortgage insurance from a third party in order to be relieved of its estimated recourse exposure on these loans 
during the third of  doral financial refined its estimate for determining expected losses from recourse obligations as it began to develop more data regarding historical losses from foreclosure and disposition of mortgage loans adjusted for expectations of changes in portfolio behavior and market environment 
this actual data on losses showed a substantially different experience than that used for newer loans for which insurance quotes are published 
the company believes that this method resulted in an adequate valuation of its recourse allowance as of december   but actual future recourse obligations may be different and a different result may have been obtained if the company had used another method for estimating this liability 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities based on current tax laws 
to the extent tax laws change  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted  to the extent necessary  in the period that the tax change is enacted 
the company recognizes income tax benefits when the realization of such benefits is probable 
a valuation allowance is recognized for any deferred tax asset which  based on management s evaluation  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets the company considers  among other matters  all sources of taxable income  including the future reversal of existing temporary differences  future taxable income  carryforwards and tax planning strategies 
in the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax asset  the company evaluates both positive and negative evidence regarding the ability of the company to generate sufficient taxable income 
the amount of the valuation allowance has been determined based on our estimates of taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and consistent with current operating results 
changes in future operating results not currently forecasted may have a significant impact on the realization of deferred tax assets

deferred tax components the company s deferred tax asset is composed primarily of the differential in the tax basis of ios sold  net operating loss carry forwards and other temporary differences arising from the daily operations of the company 
the largest component of the deferred tax asset arises from the differential in the tax basis of ios sold 
during  the company entered into two separate agreements with the puerto rico treasury department regarding the company s deferred tax asset related to prior intercompany transfers of ios the io tax asset 
the first agreement  executed during the first quarter  confirmed the previously established tax basis of all the io transfers within the dfc corporate group

table of contents deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
components of the company s deferred tax assets at december  were as follow in thousands deferred income tax asset resulting from differential in tax basis of ios sold net operating loss carry forwards allowance for loan and lease losses provision for contingencies capital loss carry forward net unrealized losses on trading and available for sale securities msrs net deferred loan origination fees costs other reserves and allowances gross deferred tax asset valuation allowance net deferred tax asset at december   the valuation allowance was million  a million increase over a large portion of this allowance was established during the fourth quarter of due to both i a three year cumulative loss position in some of the company s puerto rico taxable entities  and ii that during the fourth quarter of the year were unable to meet the tax projection  due primarily to the global financial crisis which resulted in lower than expected net interest income and higher provisions for loan and lease losses 
the allowance covers all deferred tax assets in two entities with cumulative three year losses except for the io deduction that will be transferred to the profitable puerto rico taxable entities in the amount of million and the deferred tax asset on unrealized losses on available for sale securities of million 
the allowance also includes a valuation allowance of million related to deferred taxes on unrealized losses on cash flow hedges 
net operating loss carry forwards outstanding at december  expire as follows in thousands the tax expense recognized for the year ended december  was primarily related to a charge through earnings of an additional valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets of approximately million 
the recognition of the income tax benefit for the year ended december  was principally related to changes in the company s valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets resulting from changes in earnings expectations used to evaluate the realization of the tax assets as a result of the company s million recapitalization in july the company evaluates its deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes which states that deferred tax assets should be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  the company considers the expected reversal of its deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  cumulative losses in recent years  and tax planning strategies  in making this assessment 
the determination of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets requires judgment based on the weight of all available evidence and considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
certain events occurred in the fourth quarter of that led management to reassess its expectations of the realization of 
table of contents its deferred tax assets and to conclude that an additional valuation allowance was necessary 
as of december   two of the company s puerto rico taxable entities had a three year cumulative loss in earnings before tax  and during the fourth quarter of the year were unable to meet the projected income  due primarily to a reduction in net interest income and increases in the provision for loan and lease losses 
these two entities had a pretax loss of million versus a projected pretax income of million for the fourth quarter of for purposes of assessing the realization of the deferred tax assets  this fourth quarter pretax loss and the cumulative taxable loss position for these two entities are considered significant negative evidence and have caused management to conclude that the company will not be able to fully realize the deferred tax assets related to those two entities in the future  considering the criteria of sfas no 
accordingly  as of december   the company determined that it is more likely than not that million of its gross deferred tax asset will not be realized and maintains a valuation allowance for that amount 
for puerto rico taxable entities with positive core earnings  a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets has not been recorded since they are expected to continue to be profitable 
at december   the net deferred tax asset associated with these companies was million 
approximately million of the io tax asset would be realized through these entities 
in management s opinion  for these companies  the positive evidence of profitable core earnings outweighs any negative evidence 
as of december  and september   the company s deferred tax assets amounted to million and million  respectively  with a valuation allowance of million million  respectively 
at that time  the company assessed the realization of the deferred tax assets by considering both the positive and negative evidence regarding its ability to generate sufficient taxable income 
positive evidence included realization of pre tax income for the nine month period ended september   projected earnings attributable to the core business through the projection period  repayment of million in senior notes on july   as a result of the recapitalization which served to significantly reduce interest expense  and the results of the leveraging plan 
the company believes that the losses incurred in and were due to specific and unusual events that were rooted in the restatement of the company s financial statements from to  including expenses related to outside consultants  advisors  and lawyers  the settlement of the shareholder lawsuit  the expenses associated with its recapitalization and restructuring of its balance sheet to reduce the impact of legacy issues on its future earnings 
after the recapitalization and simultaneous corporate reorganization the company started operating under a different business model which enabled it achieve significant improvements in its operating results during the latter half of and in the first nine months of positive evidence of the company s ability to realized its deferred tax assets also included the ability to isolate verifiable nonrecurring charges in historical losses  the core earnings of the business absent these nonrecurring items and the flexibility to move the io tax asset amortization and the settlement expenses to profitable entities in accordance with doral financial s agreements with the puerto rico treasury department 
during the fourth quarter of  the company implemented certain tax planning actions in order to generate future taxable income that contributed to the reduction in its valuation allowance 
these include the increase in interest earning assets of doral bank pr  through among other things  transferring certain assets from its international banking entity to doral bank pr 
negative evidence included lower than expected pre tax income for the first nine months of  and losses for the years ended december  and  and the shorter operating loss carry forward period of years  as well as uncertainty regarding its ability to generate future taxable income and the then economic outlook 
in assessing the realization of the deferred tax assets  management considered all sources of taxable income as detailed in sfas no 
 including its projection of future taxable income  cost reductions already effected and tax planning strategies 
at december  and september   management concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of its gross deferred tax asset would not be realized and maintained a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
management did not establish a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets generated on the unrealized losses of its securities available for sale since it has the intent and ability to hold these until recovery of value and has therefore determined that a valuation allowance is not necessary at this time 
failure to achieve sufficient projected taxable income in the entities and deferred tax assets where a 
table of contents valuation allowance has not been established  might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax asset 
management will reassess the realization of its deferred tax assets at each reporting period based on the criteria of sfas no 
to the extent that earnings improve and the deferred tax assets become realizable  the company may be able to reduce the valuation allowance through earnings 
fin as a result of the adoption of fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on january   the company recorded an adjustment to retained earnings of million 
as of december  and  the company had unrecognized tax benefits of million and interest and penalties of million and million  respectively 
the company classifies all interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties as income tax expense 
for both years ended december  and  the company recognized approximately million in interest and penalties 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease in the future for various reasons including adding amounts for current tax year positions  expiration of open income tax returns due to the statutes of limitation  changes in management s judgment about the level of uncertainty  status of examinations  litigation and legislative activity  and the addition or elimination of uncertain tax positions 
as of december   the following years remain subject to examination us federal jurisdictions through and puerto rico through it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the company will resolve all matters presently contemplated as unrecognized tax benefits due primarily to the expiration of the statute of limitations 
the resolution of these matters would likely result in a reduction of the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period of resolution of substantially all the unrecognized tax benefits

a substantial portion of doral financial s total residential mortgage loan originations has consistently been composed of refinancing transactions 
for the years ended december    and  refinancing transactions represented approximately  and  respectively  of the total dollar volume of internally originated mortgage loans 
doral financial s future results could be adversely affected by a significant increase in mortgage interest rates that may reduce refinancing activity 
however  the company believes that refinancing activity in puerto rico is less sensitive to interest rate changes than in the mainland united states because a significant number of refinance loans in the puerto rico mortgage market are made for debt consolidation purposes rather than interest savings due to lower rates 
loan origination channels in puerto rico  doral financial relies primarily on doral bank pr s extensive branch network to originate loans 
it supplements these originations with wholesale purchases from other financial institutions 
purchases generally consist of conventional mortgage loans

the company does not expect significant losses related to these items since it has a provision for loans under recourse agreements and for other non recourse loans has not experienced significant losses in the past 
during the fourth quarter of  the company decided to enter into an economic hedge to reduce exposure to fluctuations in the market value of its msrs 
the company executed this economic hedge by purchasing us treasuries and placing the notes in the trading account 
although the positions will not provide a perfect economic hedge  they will offset the general movements in market value of the company s msrs tied to changes in interest rates 
the company therefore continues to maintain the position given its performance 
loans held for sale loans held for sale are carried on doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition at the lower of net cost or market value on an aggregate portfolio basis 
market values are determined by reference to market prices for comparable mortgage loans  adjusted by the portfolio credit risk 
the amount by which costs exceed market value  if any  is accounted for as a loss during the period in which the change in valuation occurs 
given traditional consumer preferences in puerto rico  substantially all of doral financial s residential loans held for sale are fixed rate loans 
please refer to note of the consolidated financial statements accompanying this annual report on form k for additional information regarding doral financial s portfolio of loans held for sale 
as of december   doral financial owned approximately million in loans held for sale  of which approximately million consisted of residential mortgage loans 
during the first quarter of  the company transferred million from the loans held for sale portfolio to the loans receivable portfolio 
the company transferred the loans because they were deemed not salable to the agencies 
also during  the company performed a review of its loans held for sale portfolio 
as a result of this review  the company reassessed its plan to sell certain of its mortgage portfolio classified as held for sale and transferred a total amount of billion of loans from the held for sale portfolio to its loans receivable portfolio  at lower of cost or market on an aggregated basis and no charge resulted 
gnma programs allow financial institutions to buy back individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the company provides servicing 
at the company s option and without gnma prior authorization  doral financial may repurchase such delinquent loans for an amount equal to of the loan s remaining principal balance 
this buy back option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met  at which time the option becomes unconditional but not an obligation 
when the loans backing a gnma security are initially securitized  the company treats the transaction as a sale for accounting purposes and the loans are removed from the balance sheet because the conditional nature of the buy back option means that the company does not maintain effective control over the loans 
when individual loans later meet gnma s specified delinquency criteria and are eligible for repurchase  doral financial is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans 
in such case  for financial reporting purposes  the delinquent gnma loans are brought back into the company s portfolio of loans held for sale  regardless of whether the company intends to exercise the buy back option 
an offsetting liability is also recorded 
as of december   the portfolio of loans held for sale includes million related to gnma defaulted loans  compared to million and million as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents loans receivable doral financial originates mortgage loans secured by income producing residential and commercial properties  construction loans  land loans  certain residential mortgage loans and other commercial and consumer loans that are held for investment and classified as loans receivable 
loans receivable are originated primarily through doral financial s banking subsidiaries 
during  the company experienced a significant increase in loans receivable principally related to the reclassification of billion of loans from the loans held for sale portfolio to the loans receivable portfolio 
a significant portion of doral financial s loans receivable consists of loans made to entities or individuals located in puerto rico 
the maximum aggregate amount in unsecured loans that doral bank pr could make to a single borrower under puerto rico banking regulations as of december   was approximately million 
puerto rico banking regulations permit larger loans to a single borrower to the extent secured by qualifying collateral 
the maximum aggregate amount in loans that doral bank ny could make to a single borrower under the ots banking regulations as of december   was million

expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because of prepayments and other market factors 
loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity are reported as due in one year or less 

table of contents table m loans receivable by contractual maturities as of december  year to over or less years years total in thousands construction loans residential mortgage loans commercial secured by real estate consumer other lease financing receivable commercial non real estate loans on savings deposits land secured loans receivable  gross scheduled contractual amortization of loans receivable does not reflect the expected life of doral financial s loans receivable portfolio 
the average life of these loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments and  with respect to conventional mortgage loans  due on sale clauses  which give doral financial the right to declare a conventional mortgage loan immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan rates are higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decrease when current mortgage loan rates are lower than rates on existing mortgage loans 
under the latter circumstance  the weighted average yield on loans decreases as higher yielding loans are repaid or refinanced at lower rates 
the following table sets forth the dollar amount of total loans receivable at december   as shown in the preceding table  which have fixed interest rates or which have floating or adjustable interest rates that have a contractual maturity of more than one year

unlike its portfolio of residential mortgage loans  which is comprised almost entirely of fixed rate mortgage loans  a significant portion of doral financial s construction  land  and other commercial loans classified as loans receivable carry adjustable rates 
at december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of doral financial s gross loans receivable were adjustable rate loans 
the decrease in the percentage of adjustable rate loans over the years was the result of the transfers of billion and million of residential mortgage loans from the held for sale portfolio to the loans receivable portfolio during and  respectively  resulting in the increase of the company s fixed rate portfolio 
also  the decrease in adjustable rate loans in the portfolio relates to the decrease in the construction loans portfolio 
the adjustable rate construction  commercial and land loans have interest rate adjustment limitations and are generally tied to the prime rate  and often provide for a maximum and minimum rate beyond which the applicable interest rate will not fluctuate 
future market factors may affect the correlation of the interest rate adjustment with the rate doral financial pays on the different funding sources used to finance these loans

table of contents investment and trading activities as part of its mortgage securitization activities  doral financial is involved in the purchase and sale of mortgage backed securities 
at december   doral financial  principally through its banking subsidiaries  held securities for trading with a fair market value of million  of which million consisted of us treasuries securities 
during the fourth quarter of  the company decided to enter into an economic hedge to reduce exposure to fluctuations in the market value of its msrs 
the company executed this economic hedge by purchasing us treasuries and placing the notes in the trading account 
securities held for trading are reflected on doral financial s consolidated financial statements at their fair market value with resulting gains or losses included in current period earnings as part of net gain loss on securities held for trading 
see critical accounting policies valuation of trading securities and derivatives above for additional information on how doral financial determines the fair values of its trading securities 
as part of its strategy to diversify its revenue sources and maximize net interest income  doral financial also invests in securities that are classified as available for sale  or prior to december  held to maturity 
as of december   doral financial  principally through its banking subsidiaries  held billion of investment securities that were classified as available for sale and reported at fair value based on quoted or evaluated market prices  with unrealized gains or losses included in stockholders equity and reported as accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of income tax in doral financial s consolidated financial statements 
of this amount  approximately was held at doral financial s banking subsidiaries 
at december   doral financial had unrealized losses on investment securities available for sale  net of tax in aoci of million  compared to unrealized losses of million at december  related to its available for sale portfolio 
the company evaluates its investment securities for impairment at least quarterly or earlier if other factors indicative of potential impairment exist 
an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of income is recognized when the decline in the fair value of the securities below their cost basis is judged to be other than temporary 
the company evaluates for other than temporary impairment in accordance with fasb staff position fas the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which requires that the company consider various factors in determining whether it should recognize an impairment charge  including  but not limited to  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been below cost basis  the expectations for the security s performance  the creditworthiness of the issuer  and the company s intention and ability to hold the security until maturity 
the unrealized losses in the company s investment securities are almost entirely related to increased spreads required by investors over benchmark securities due to liquidity concerns  which tend to reduce the value of fixed income securities  and are not related to credit impairments 
most of the company s securities are mortgage backed securities or securities backed by a us government sponsored entity  that are highly rated 
doral financial s investment portfolio is mostly composed of debt securities with aaa rating 
the company has the ability and intent to hold such securities until maturity or until the unrealized losses are recovered 

table of contents as of december   the us private label cmo s that were purchased during the fourth quarter of as part of the company s asset purchase program were showing significant unrealized losses 
the price movement on these securities has been adversely affected by the conditions of the us financial markets  specifically the non agency mortgage market 
prices of many of the company s private label mortgage backed securities dropped dramatically during the year ended december   as delinquencies and foreclosures affecting the loans underlying these securities continued to worsen and as credit markets became highly illiquid beginning in late february and march the collateral underlying these bonds can be split up into two categories hybrid arm s amounting to million and pay option arm s amounting to million 
hybrid arm collateral has been less impacted by the recent market turmoil principally due to the fact the underlying characteristics of the collateral provide for more stable cash flows and the delinquencies of the underlying deals has been less than that of the pay option arm backed deals 
price performance and delinquency trends of the pay option arm backed deals have been worse than that of the hybrid arm deals 
most of the bonds are first or second tier aaa superior senior or senior mezzanine tranches which means they are at the top of the capital structure 
these bonds have an average subordination of and a range of subordination of from to  beneath them 
management has evaluated different frequency and severity of loss assumptions and expects to receive all principal on or before maturity of securities 
management has also compared the subordination on these bonds to standard poor s current loss estimates and loss estimates are below the current subordination level with a reasonable margin existing between the two 
as a result of the characteristics of both  the option arms and hybrid arms  the level of subordination  and the evaluation of possible loss scenarios  management concluded it would not incur losses 
management therefore expects these securities to recover value and intends and has the ability to hold them until value is recovered 
however  it is possible that future loss assumptions could change and cause future other than temporary impairment charges 
private label cmo s also include the pr private label cmo s amounting to million that are comprised of subordinate tranches of securitizations using doral originated collateral primarily of and vintage loans 
doral purchased the cmos at a discounted price of of par value  anticipating a partial loss of principal and interest value and as a result  account for these investments under the guidance of eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets 
during the first quarter of  the company transferred these securities from held for trading portfolio to the available for sale portfolio at a price of of par value 
recent price performance of these bonds has generated unrealized losses  driven primarily by liquidity events in the us mortgage market 
the delinquency trend of the underlying collateral has deteriorated from original expectations  although performance has been considerably better than that of similar us mortgage backed assets 
furthermore  home prices in puerto rico have not experienced the significant deterioration in value as those in the us mainland 
during the third quarter of  as part of its impairment testing under eitf  the company recognized an other than temporary impairment of approximately million on one security from this portfolio due to the probability of higher principal and interest losses 
two additional securities were also evaluated 
expected losses have not increased for these securities  and management believes they are not other than temporarily impaired 
in january  the fasb issued an amendment to eitf aligning the impairment model of issue no to be more consistent with that of fasb statement  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  by eliminating the requirement to consider market participants views of cash flows of a security in determining whether or not an other than temporary impairment had occurred 
this change was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after december  at december   the company revised its procedures to account for this change and determined that no additional impairments were required under eitf  amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no 
however  it is possible that future loss assumptions could change and cause future other than temporary impairment charges 
during the fourth quarter of  the company transferred its held to maturity portfolio  amounting to approximately billion  to the available for sale portfolio and subsequently sold million in long dated us treasury securities for a gain 
the sale was executed to reduce the company s interest rate risk exposure 
management weighed certain factors in making the decision to transfer the securities from the held to maturity to available for sale  and determined its revised interest rate risk parameters required greater flexibility in asset liability management 
since the transfer did not qualify under the exemption 
table of contents provisions for the sale or transfer of held to maturity securities under sfas  the reclassification decision by the company is deemed to have tainted the held to maturity category and it will not be permitted to classify prospectively any investment securities scoped under sfas as held to maturity for a period of two years 
the company recognized at the time of the transfer the unrealized loss on available for sale securities  net of taxes 
under current conditions  based on credit characteristics of the investment portfolio  management assessment is that the company has the intent and ability to retain its portfolio of investment securities until market recovery 
during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into various interest rate cap transactions to hedge part of the interest rate risk associated with some assets purchases 
these transactions are intended to be economic hedges  but will be accounted for as trading account instruments

lbi was placed in a securities investor protection corporation sipc liquidation proceeding after the filing for bankruptcy of its parent lehman brothers holding inc the filing of the sipc liquidation proceeding was an event of default under the repurchase agreements and the forward agreements resulting in their termination as of september  the termination of the agreements led to a reduction in the company s total assets and total liabilities of approximately million 
the termination of the agreements caused doral to recognize a previously unrealized loss on the value of the securities subject to the agreements  resulting in a million charge during the third quarter of doral filed a claim with the sipc trustee for lbi that it is owed approximately million  representing the excess of the value of the securities held by lbi above the amounts owed by doral under the agreements  plus ancillary expenses and damages 
doral has fully reserved ancillary expenses and interest 
in december  the sipc trustee announced that final submission of claims for customers was january and set a deadline of june for other creditor claims 
they also announced that they expect to have enough assets to cover customer claims but stated that they could not determine at this point what would be available to pay general creditors 
based on this information  doral determined that the process will likely take more than a year and that mounting legal and operating costs would likely impair the ability of lbi to pay of the claims  especially for general creditors 
the fourth quarter also saw the continued decline in asset values and management concluded that it was likely that lbi assets would also decline in value 
management evaluated this receivable in accordance with the guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  and related pronouncements 
as a result  doral accrued a loss of million against the million owed by lbi as of december  the net receivable of million is recorded in accounts receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
determining the reserve amount requires management to use considerable judgment and is based on the facts currently available 
as additional information on the sipc proceeding becomes available  doral may need to accrue further losses or reverse losses already accrued 
the actual loss that may ultimately be incurred by doral with respect to its pending lbi claim may have a significant adverse impact on the company s results of operations

doral financial s banking subsidiaries rely primarily on deposits  including brokered deposits which are all insured so as to meet the coverage for fdic deposit insurance up to applicable limits  borrowings under advances from fhlb and repurchase agreements secured by pledges of their mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities as their primary sources of liquidity 
the banking subsidiaries also have significant investments in loans and investment securities  which together with the owned mortgage servicing rights  serve as a source of cash

cash sources and uses doral financial s sources of cash of december  include retail and commercial deposits  borrowings under advances from fhlb  repurchase financing agreements  principal repayments and sale of loans and securities 
management does not contemplate material uncertainties in the rolling over of deposits  both retail and wholesale  and is not engaged in capital expenditures that would materially affect the capital and liquidity positions 
in addition  the company s banking subsidiaries maintain borrowing facilities with the fhlb and at the discount window of the federal reserve  and have a considerable amount of collateral that can be used to raise funds under these facilities 
doral financial uses of cash as of december  include origination and purchase of loans  purchase of investment securities  repayment of obligations as they become due  dividend payments related to the preferred stock  and other operational needs 
the company also is required to deposit cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements 
to the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines because of changes in interest rates  a liquidity crisis or any other factors  the company will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements  thereby adversely affecting its liquidity

brokered deposits are used by doral financial s retail banking subsidiaries as a source of long term funds  and doral financial s retail banking subsidiaries have traditionally been able to replace maturing brokered deposits 
certificates of deposit with principal amounts of  or more include time deposits issued to deposit brokers in form of large  or more certificates of deposits that have been participated out by the broker in shares of less than  as of december   all certificates of deposits were within the applicable fdic insurance limit 
brokered deposits  however  are generally considered a less stable source of funding than core deposits obtained through retail bank branches 
brokered deposit investors are generally very sensitive to interest rates and will generally move funds from one depository institution to another based on minor differences in rates offered on deposits 
doral financial s banking subsidiaries  as members of the fhlb ny  have access to collateralized borrowings from the fhlb ny up to a maximum of of total assets 
in addition  the fhlb ny makes available additional borrowing capacity in form of repurchase agreements on qualifying high grade securities 
advances and reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of credit must be secured by qualifying assets with a market value of of the advances or reimbursement obligations 
as of december   doral financial s banking subsidiaries had billion in outstanding advances from the fhlb ny at a weighted average interest rate cost of 
please refer to note of the consolidated financial statements accompanying this annual report on form k for additional information regarding such advances 
doral financial also derives liquidity from the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market 
the us including puerto rico secondary mortgage market is the most liquid in the world in large part because of the sale or guarantee programs maintained by fha  va  hud  fnma and fhlmc 
to the extent these programs are curtailed or the standard for insuring or selling loans under such programs is materially increased  or  for any reason  doral financial were to fail to qualify for such programs  doral financial s ability to sell mortgage loans and consequently its liquidity would be materially adversely affected 
other uses of cash servicing agreements relating to the mortgage backed securities programs of fnma  fhlmc and gnma  and to mortgage loans sold to certain other investors  require doral financial to advance funds to make scheduled payments of principal  interest  taxes and insurance  if such payments have not been received from the borrowers 
while doral financial generally recovers funds advanced pursuant to these arrangements within days  it must absorb the cost of the funds it advances during the time the advance is outstanding 
for the year ended december   the monthly average amount of funds advanced by 
table of contents doral financial under such servicing agreements was approximately million  compared to million for to the extent the mortgage loans underlying doral financial s servicing portfolio experience increased delinquencies  doral financial would be required to dedicate additional cash resources to comply with its obligation to advance funds as well as incur additional administrative costs related to increases in collection efforts 
in the past  doral financial sold pools of delinquent fha and va and conventional mortgage loans 
under these arrangements  doral financial is required to advance the scheduled payments whether or not collected from the underlying borrower 
while doral financial expects to recover the amounts advanced through foreclosure or  in the case of fha va loans  under the applicable fha and va insurance and guarantee programs  the amounts advanced tend to be greater than normal arrangements because of the delinquent status of the loans 
as of december  and  the outstanding principal balance of such delinquent loans was million and million  respectively  and the aggregate monthly amount of funds advanced by doral financial was million and million  respectively 
when doral financial sells mortgage loans to third parties  which serves as a source of cash  it also generally makes customary representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the loans sold 
to the extent the loans do not meet specified characteristics  investors are generally entitled to cause doral financial to repurchase such loans 
in addition to its servicing and warranty obligations  in the past doral financial s loan sale activities have included the sale of non conforming mortgage loans subject to recourse arrangements that generally require doral financial to repurchase or substitute the loans if the loans are days or more past due or otherwise in default up to a specified amount or limited to a period of time after the sale 
to the extent the delinquency ratios of the loans sold subject to recourse are greater than anticipated and doral financial is required to repurchase more loans than anticipated  doral financial s liquidity requirements would increase 
please refer to off balance sheet activities below for additional information on these arrangements 
in the past  doral financial sold or securitized mortgage loans with fnma on a partial or full recourse basis 
doral financial s contractual agreements with fnma authorize fnma to require doral financial to post collateral in the form of cash or marketable securities to secure such recourse obligation to the extent doral financial does not maintain an investment grade rating 
as of december   doral financial s maximum recourse exposure with fnma amounted to million and required the posting of a minimum of million in collateral to secure recourse obligations 
while deemed unlikely by doral financial  fnma has the contractual right to request collateral for the full amount of doral financial s recourse obligations 
any such request by fnma would have a material adverse effect on doral financial s liquidity and business 
please refer to note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and off balance sheet activities below for additional information on these arrangements 
under doral financial s repurchase lines of credit and derivative contracts  doral financial is required to deposit cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements

as of december   doral bank pr and doral bank ny were considered well capitalized banks for purposes of the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the fdic pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of to be considered a well capitalized institution under the fdic s regulations  an institution must maintain a leverage ratio of at least  a tier capital ratio of at least and a total capital ratio of at least and not be subject to any written agreement or directive to meet a specific capital ratio 
failure to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements could result in the initiation of certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by banking regulators against doral financial and its banking subsidiaries that  if undertaken  could have a material adverse effect on doral financial 
on march   doral financial entered into a consent order with the federal reserve  pursuant to which the company submitted a capital plan in which it established a target minimum leverage ratio of for doral financial and for doral bank pr 
for a detailed description of this order  please refer to part i  item legal proceedings  in this annual report on form k 
while the tier and total capital ratios have risk weighting components that take into account the low level of risk associated with the company s mortgage and securities portfolios  the leverage ratio is significantly lower because it is based on total average assets without any risk weighting 
as of december   the doral financial s banking subsidiaries were in compliance with all capital requirements 
on february  and july   the board of directors of doral financial approved a capital infusion of million and million  respectively  to doral bank to maintain its regulatory capital ratios above well capitalized levels 
assets and liabilities at december   doral financial s total assets were billion compared to billion at december  the increase in assets during corresponded to the company s plan to increase its earning assets by billion during the increase in assets was principally driven by an increase of billion in investment securities portfolio  primarily related to the purchase of billion in investment securities during  offset by maturities and sales and also  to the increase of million in the loan portfolio 
total liabilities were billion at december   compared to billion at december  the increase in liabilities largely corresponded to the increase in investment securities and was reflected by the increase of billion in securities sold under agreements to repurchase and million in advances from fhlb ny 
also  the increase in liabilities was related to other short term borrowings amounted to billion which represents the balance of a line of credit with the federal home loan bank and auction term funds to depository institutions granted by the federal reserve under taf 

table of contents during september  the company reduced its total assets and liabilities by million 
this reduction was associated with the termination of repurchase financing arrangements and the sale of the collateral associated with such financing arrangements with lbi as a result of the sipc s liquidation proceedings of lbi as of september  the termination of the agreements has also caused doral to recognize a previously unrealized loss on the value of the securities subject to the agreements  resulting in a million charge during the third quarter of doral filed a claim with the sipc trustee for lbi that it is owed approximately million  representing the excess of the value of the securities held by lbi above the amounts owed by doral under the agreements  plus ancillary expenses and damages

off balance sheet activities prior to  the company normally sold loans that did not qualify for the insurance or guarantee programs of fha and va  or the sale or exchange programs of fnma or fhlmc non conforming loans to local financial institutions on a recourse basis pursuant to which doral financial retained part of the credit risk associated with such loans after sale 
the company also sold loans under various recourse agreements to fnma and fhlmc 
doral financial s contingent obligation with respect to such recourse provision is not reflected on doral financial s consolidated financial statements  except for a liability of million  as of december   for estimated losses from such recourse agreements  which is included as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities 
doral financial s current strategy is to sell loans on a non recourse basis  except recourse for certain early payment defaults 
in the past  in relation to its asset securitization and loan sale activities  the company sold pools of delinquent fha  va and conventional mortgage loans on a servicing retained basis 
following these transactions  the loans are not reflected on doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
under these arrangements  as part of its servicing responsibilities  doral financial is required to advance the scheduled payments of principal and interest whether or not collected from the underlying borrower 
while doral financial expects to recover a significant portion of the amounts advanced through foreclosure or  in the case of fha and va loans  under applicable fha and va insurance and guarantee programs  the amounts advanced tend to be greater than normal arrangements because of delinquent status of the loans 
in addition  doral financial s loan sale activities in the past included certain mortgage loan sale and securitization transactions subject to recourse arrangements that require doral financial to repurchase or substitute the loan if the loans are days or more past due or otherwise in default 
the company is also required to pay interest on delinquent loans in the form of servicing advances 
under certain of these arrangements  the recourse obligation is terminated upon compliance with certain conditions  which generally involve the lapse of time normally from four to seven years  the lapse of time combined with certain other conditions such as the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loans falling below a specific percentage normally less than of the appraised value of the underlying property or the amount of loans repurchased pursuant to recourse provisions reaching a specific percentage of the original principal amount of loans sold generally from to 
as of december   the company s records reflected that the outstanding principal balance of loans sold subject to full or partial recourse was billion 
as of such date  the company s records also reflected that the maximum contractual exposure to doral financial if it were required to repurchase all loans subject to recourse was billion 
doral financial s contingent obligation with respect to its recourse provision is not reflected on the company s consolidated financial statements  except for a liability for estimated losses from such recourse agreements 
the company discounted the practice of selling loans with recourse obligations in the company s approach for estimating its liability for expected losses from recourse obligations was based on the amount that would be required to pay for mortgage insurance to a third party in order to be 
table of contents relieved of its recourse exposure on these loans 
during the third quarter of  doral financial refined its estimate for determining expected losses from recourse obligations as it began to develop more data regarding historical losses from foreclosure and disposition of mortgage loans adjusted for expectations of changes in portfolio behavior and market environment 
this actual data on losses showed a substantially different experience than that used for newer loans for which insurance quotes are published 
doral financial reserves for its exposure to recourse and the other credit enhanced transactions explained above amounted million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the change in the approach used to estimate the extent of the expected losses resulted in a million change in the underlying reserves

doral financial is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments may include commitments to extend credit and sell loans 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the statement of financial position 
the contractual amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement the company has in particular classes of financial instruments 
the company s exposure to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit or for forward sales is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
doral financial uses the same credit policies in making these commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
at december   commitments to extend credit and commercial and financial standby letters of credit amounted to approximately million and million  respectively  and commitments to sell loans amounted to approximately million 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as the conditions established in the contract are met 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
in the ordinary course of the business  doral financial makes certain representations and warranties to purchasers and insurers of mortgage loans at the time of the loan sales to third parties regarding the characteristics of the loans sold  and in certain circumstances  such as in the event of early or first payment default 
to the extent the loans do not meet specified characteristics  if there is a breach of contract of a representation or warranty or if there is an early payment default  doral financial may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan and bear any subsequent loss related to the loan

risk management doral financial s business is subject to four broad categories of risks interest rate risk  credit risk  operational risk and liquidity risk 
doral financial has specific policies and procedures which have been designed to identify  measure and manage risks to which the company is exposed 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk refers to the risk that changes in interest rates may adversely affect the value of doral financial s assets and liabilities and its net interest income 

table of contents doral financial s risk management policies are designed with the goal of maximizing shareholder value with emphasis on stability of net interest income and market value of equity 
these policies are also designed to ensure the maintenance of adequate capitalization  liquidity  and other regulatory requirements 
the objectives of doral financial s risk management policies are pursued within the limits established by the board of directors of the company 
the board of directors has delegated the monitoring of interest rate and market risk to its risk policy committee 
doral financial s asset liability management committee alco has been created under the authority of the board of directors to manage the company s interest rate and market risk 
the alco is primarily responsible for ensuring that doral financial operates within the company s established asset liability management policy guidelines and procedures 
the alco reports directly to the risk policy committee of the board of directors 
the alco is responsible for developing the company s asset liability management and liquidity strategy  recommending for board approval asset liability and liquidity risk limits that are consistent with the company s policies  overseeing product pricing and volume objectives for customer related activities  overseeing the company s secondary market activities  monitoring compliance with risk limits and judging adequacy of the execution of tactics by the funds management group  and overseeing the maintenance of management information systems that supply  on a timely basis  the information and data necessary for the alco to fulfill its role as the company s asset liability manager 
risk identification measurement and control doral financial manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated basis 
changes in interest rates can affect the volume of doral financial s mortgage loan originations  the net interest income earned on doral financial s portfolio of loans and securities  the amount of gain on the sale of loans and the value of doral financial s servicing assets  ios  and loans and securities holdings 
as part of its interest rate risk management practices  doral financial has implemented measures to better identify the interest rate risk associated with the company s assets and liabilities and has developed policies and procedures to control and manage these risks 
doral financial continues to explore ways to improve its interest rate risk management practices 
the company currently manages its interest rate risk by principally focusing on the following metrics a net interest income sensitivity  b market value equity sensitivity  c effective duration of equity  and d maturity repricing gaps 
doral financial asset liability management policies provides a limit structure based on interest income sensitivity  market value equity sensitivity and effective duration of equity 
a single limit is defined for effective duration of equity 
net interest income sensitivity limits are set for a twelve month horizon and for defined for instantaneous parallel rate shifts 
specific parallel rate shifts defined for net interest income and market value equity limits are bps  bps  bps  bps  bps  and bps 
no specific limits are defined for maturity repricing gaps  since mismatch risk is fully reflected in net interest income and market value equity sensitivity measures 
the explanations below provide definitions  methodologies and assumptions used to estimate interest rate risk metrics net interest income sensitivity 
refers to the relationship between market interest rates and net interest income due to the maturity and repricing characteristics of doral financial s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
to measure net interest income exposure to changes 
table of contents in market interest rates  the company uses earning simulations techniques 
these simulations techniques allow for the forecasting of net interest income and expenses under various rate scenarios for the measurement interest rate risk exposures of doral financial 
primary scenarios include instantaneous parallel and non parallel rate shocks 
net interest income sensitivity is measured for time horizons ranging from twelve to sixty months and therefore is a measure focused on short to medium term risk 
the basic underlying assumptions for net interest income simulations are a static balance sheet  b full reinvestment of funds in similar product instruments with similar maturity and repricing characteristics  c spread risk modeled and assumed constant  d prepayment rates on mortgages and mortgage related securities modeled using multi factor prepayment model  and e non maturity deposit run offs and embedded options are also taken into account as part of net interest income simulations and risk measurements 
market value of equity sensitivity 
used to capture and measure the risks associated with longer term maturity and re pricing imbalances 
doral financial uses value simulations techniques for all financial components of the statement of financial condition 
valuation techniques include static cash flows analyses  stochastic models to qualify value of embedded options and prepayment modeling 
to complement and broaden the risk analysis  the company uses duration and convexity analysis to measure the sensitivity of the market value of equity to changes in interest rates 
duration measures the linear change in market value of equity caused by changes in interest rates  while  convexity measures the asymmetric changes in market value of equity caused by changes in interest rates due to the presence of options 
the analysis of duration and convexity combined provide a better understanding of the sensitivity of the market value of equity to changes in interest rates 
effective duration of equity 
the effective duration of equity is a broad measure of the impact of interest rates changes on doral financial s capital 
the measure summarizes the net sensitivity of assets and liabilities  adjusted for off balance sheet positions 
the stated threshold for doral financial effective duration of equity is years 
interest rate risk management strategy doral financial s current interest rate management strategy is implemented by the alco and is designed to reduce the volatility of the company s net interest income and to protect the market value of equity 
while the current strategy will also use a combination of derivatives and balance sheet management  more emphasis is being placed on balance sheet management 
under the company s risk management strategy  the company s outstanding open derivative positions increased from million at december  to million at december  net interest income risk 
in order to protect net interest income against interest rate risk  the alco employs a number of strategies  which are adjusted in relation to prevailing market conditions 
internal balance sheet management practices are designed to reduce the re pricing gaps of the company s assets and liabilities 
these techniques seek longer term funds through the use of long term repurchase agreements  advances from fhlb ny and brokered deposits 
currently  the company mainly uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management activities 
interest rate swaps represent a mutual agreement to exchange interest rate payments  one party pays fixed rate and the other pays a floating rate 
for net interest income protection  doral financial typically pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a floating rate of interest 
market value of equity hedging strategies 
due to the composition of doral financial s assets and liabilities  the company has exposure to decreasing interest rates in the short run and to rising interest rates in medium term to long term 
the company measures the market value of all rate sensitive assets and liabilities  the difference is what is termed market value of equity 
the company measures how this market value of equity fluctuates with different rate scenarios 
management uses duration matching strategies to 
table of contents manage the fluctuations of market value of equity within the long term targets established by the board of directors of the company 
duration risk 
in order to bring duration measures within the long term target of the company  management may use a combination of internal liabilities management techniques and derivative instruments 
doral financial primarily uses the following derivatives for such purposes interest rate swaps swaptions eurodollar futures treasury futures doral financial also enters into forward sale agreements to sell mortgage backed securities by setting the price in advance to protect the company against increases in interest rates and concurrent reductions in the price of mortgage backed securities 
convexity risk 
convexity is a measure of how much duration changes as interest rates change 
for doral financial  convexity risk primarily results from mortgage prepayment risk 
in order to bring convexity measures within the long term targets of the company  management primarily uses a combination of internal balance sheet management and the following derivatives swaptions put and call options on eurodollar futures put and call options on agency mortgage backed securities put and call options on treasury futures call options represent the right to buy a specified security at a specified price in the future 
their value generally increases as interest rates fall 
put options represent the right to sell a specified security in the future 
their value generally increases as interest rates rise 
these instruments enable the company to hedge against adverse changes in market value of equity due to unexpected movements in interest rates  taking into consideration the duration and interest rate sensitivity of the company s loan and investment portfolio 
doral financial s risk profile doral financial s goal is to manage market and interest rate risk within targeted levels established and periodically reviewed by the board of directors 
the interest risk profile of the company is managed by using natural offsets generated by the different components of the balance sheet during the natural course of business operations and through active hedging activities using debt and derivative instruments to achieve targeted risk levels 
the company s interest rate risk exposure can be segregated into linear and non linear risk components based on the varying changes to the market value of equity due to changes in interest rates 
the linear risk is managed through interest rate caps and future contracts 
the non linear risk arises primarily from embedded optionality in our products and transactions which allows clients and counterparties to modify the maturity of loans  securities  deposits and or borrowings 
examples of non linear risks include the ability of a mortgagee to prepay his her mortgage or a counterparty exercising its puttable option on a structured transaction 
the embedded optionality is primarily managed by purchasing or selling options or by other active risk management strategies involving the use of derivatives  including the forward sale of mortgage backed securities 

table of contents the tables below show the risk profile of doral financial taking into account the derivatives set forth below under basis point parallel and instantaneous increases or decreases of interest rates  as of december  and market value net interest as of december  of equity risk income risk bps bps market value net interest as of december  of equity risk income risk bps bps based on a month forward change in net interest income 
as of december   the market value of equity mve sensitivity measure showed a reduction when compared to december  this reduction in mve sensitivity is due primarily to a contraction of asset durations  specially mortgage loan and mortgage related investment securities 
also  extensions in maturities of wholesale liabilities help in maintaining mve sensitivity at a low level 
the company has been actively managing the balance sheet to maintain the interest rate risk measures within policy limits 
during the third and fourth quarter of  the company reduced its portfolio of long dated callable securities and has replaced some of those investments with shorter duration hybrid and variable rate mortgage securities 
the company also extended the maturity of its advances from fhlb  issued long term brokered certificates of deposits and entered into pay fixed received floating interest rate swaps 
the net interest income nii sensitivity measure  based on a month horizon  increased when comparing december  to december  this increase in nii sensitivity was mainly due to the shortening of assets durations

as part of this strategy the company has reduced its long term fixed rate and callable investment securities and increased shorter duration investment securities 
since december  the company has sold over billion of long duration securities and negotiated the termination of callable funding arrangements associated with these securities 
over the course of  the company increased investment positions in hybrid and variable rate mortgage securities and extended the duration of liabilities as part of its hedging program 
this strategy has reduced the overall risk profile of the company as measured by mve and has increased net interest income sensitivity in the short run

derivatives 
as described above  doral financial uses derivatives to manage its exposure to interest rate risk caused by changes in interest rates 
derivatives are generally either privately negotiated over the counter otc contracts or standard contracts transacted through regulated exchanges 
otc contracts generally consist of swaps  caps and collars  forwards and options 
exchange traded derivatives include futures and options 
the company is subject to various interest rate cap agreements to manage its interest rate exposure 
interest rate cap agreements generally involve purchase of out of the money caps to protect the company from larger rate moves and to provide the company with positive convexity 
non performance by the counterparty exposes doral financial to interest rate risk

interest rate swap agreements generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal 
the company principally uses interest rate swaps to convert floating rate liabilities to fixed rate by entering into pay fixed receive floating interest rate swaps 
non performance by the counterparty exposes doral financial to interest rate risk

doral financial uses derivatives to manage market risk and generally accounts for such instruments on a mark to market basis with gains or losses charged to current operations as part of net gain loss on securities held for trading as they occur 
contracts with positive fair values are recorded as assets and contracts with negative fair values as liabilities  after the application of netting arrangements 
fair values of derivatives such as interest rate futures contracts or options are determined by reference to market prices 
fair values for derivatives purchased in the over the counter market are determined by valuation models and validated with prices provided by external sources 
the notional amounts of freestanding derivatives totaled million and million  respectively  as of december  and notional amounts indicate the volume of derivatives activity  but do not represent doral financial s exposure to market or credit risk 
historically  the high volume of derivatives used by doral financial was associated with the company s economic hedging strategy 
doral financial s current risk management strategy is more focused on internal balance sheet management and the use of interest rate swaps for interest rate risk management purposes 
the increased focus on internal balance sheet management has resulted in a lower volume of derivatives 
derivatives hedge accounting 
doral financial seeks to designate derivatives under hedge accounting guidelines when it can clearly identify an asset or liability that can be hedged using hedge accounting guidelines 
the notional amounts of swaps treated under hedge accounting totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the company typically uses interest rate swaps to convert floating rate advances from fhlb to fixed rate by entering into pay fixed receive floating swaps 
in these cases  the company matches all of the terms in the advances from fhlb to the floating leg of the interest rate swap 
since both transactions are symmetrically opposite the effectiveness of the hedging relationship is high

the market risk of derivatives arises principally from the potential for changes in the value of derivative contracts based on changes in interest rates 
the credit risk of otc derivatives arises from the potential of counterparties to default on their contractual obligations 
to manage this credit risk  doral financial deals with counterparties of good credit standing  enters into master netting agreements whenever possible and  as needed  obtains collateral 
master netting agreements incorporate rights of set off that provide for the net settlement of contracts with the same counterparty in the event of default 
as a result of the ratings downgrades affecting doral financial  counterparties to derivatives contracts used for interest risk management purposes could increase the applicable margin requirements under such contracts  or could require the company to terminate such agreements

credit risk doral financial is subject to credit risk with respect to its portfolio of loans receivable 
loans receivable are loans that doral financial holds for investment and  therefore  the company is at risk for the term of the loans 
with respect to mortgage loans originated for sale as part of its mortgage banking business  doral financial is generally at risk for any mortgage loan default from the time it originates the mortgage loan until the time it sells the loan or packages it into a mortgage backed security 
with respect to fha loans  doral financial is fully insured as to principal by the fha against foreclosure loss 
va loans are guaranteed within a range of to of the principal amount of the loan subject to a maximum  ranging from  to  in addition to the mortgage collateral 
prior to  the company sold loans on a recourse basis as part of the ordinary course of business 
as part of such transactions  the company committed to make payments to remedy loan defaults or to repurchase defaulted loans 
please refer to off balance sheet activities above for additional information regarding recourse obligations 
in mid  the company discontinued the practice of selling mortgage loans with recourse  except for recourse related to early payments defaults 
the residential mortgage portfolio includes loans that  at some point were repurchased pursuant to recourse obligations and  as a result  have a higher credit risk 
repurchases of delinquent loans from recourse obligations in amounted to million and resulted in a loss of million 
when repurchased from recourse obligations  loans are recorded at their market value  which includes a discount for poor credit performance 
doral financial has historically provided land acquisition  development  and construction financing to developers of residential housing projects and  as consequence  has a relatively high credit risk exposure to this sector 
construction loans extended to developers are typically adjustable rate loans  indexed to the prime interest rate with terms ranging generally from to months 
doral financial principally targeted developers of residential construction for single family primary home occupancy 
as a result of the negative outlook for the puerto rico economy and its adverse effect on the construction industry  in the 
table of contents fourth quarter of  the company ceased financing new housing projects in puerto rico 
as a result  the exposure to the residential construction sector has decreased from million as of december   to million as of december  management expects that the amounts of loans and exposure to the construction industry will continue to decrease in subsequent years 
because most of doral financial s loans are made to borrowers located in puerto rico and secured by properties located in puerto rico  the company is subject to credit risks tied to adverse economic  political or business developments and natural hazards  such as hurricanes  that may affect puerto rico 
puerto rico economy has been in a recession since this has affected borrowers disposable incomes and their ability to make payments as due  causing an increase in delinquency and foreclosures rates 
the company believes that these conditions will continue to affect its credit quality 
in addition  there is evidence that property values have declined from their peak 
this has reduced borrowers capacity to refinance and increased the exposure to loss upon default 
this decline is incorporated into the loss rates used for calculating the company s allowance for loan and lease losses 
doral financial mitigates loan defaults on its construction and commercial portfolios through its loan workout function 
the function s main responsibilities are avoiding defaults and minimizing losses upon default of relatively large credit relationships 
the group utilizes relationship officers  collection specialists and attorneys 
in the case of residential construction projects  the workout function monitors project specifics  such as project management and marketing  as deemed necessary 
with respect to residential mortgages  the company employs industry standard collection and loss mitigation strategies 
the company also engages in the restructuring of the debt of borrowers who are delinquent due to economic or legal reasons  if the company determines that it is in the best interest for both the company and the borrower to do so 
in some cases  due the nature of the borrower s financial condition  the restructure or loan modification fits the definition of troubled debt restructuring tdr as defined by the standard of financial accounting accounting by debtors and creditors of troubled debt restructurings 
such restructures are identified as tdrs and accounted for based on the provisions sfas no

as of december   the company had restructured million  million and million of residential construction  commercial and residential mortgage loans within its portfolio  respectively  that fit the definition of tdr s 
non performing assets and allowance for loan and lease losses non performing assets consist of loans on a non accrual basis  other real estate owned and other non performing assets 
loans are placed on a non accrual basis after they are delinquent for more than days 
on a case by case basis  the company may decide that a particular loan should be placed in non accrual status based on the borrower s financial condition  or  in the case of construction loans  if a given project is considered to be seriously behind schedule or experiencing economic distress 
generally  when the loan is placed on non accrual  all accrued but unpaid interest to date is reversed 
such interest  if collected  is credited to income in the period of the recovery  and the loan returns to accrual when it becomes current and or collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company places in non accrual status all residential construction loans classified as substandard whose sole source of payment are interest reserves funded by doral financial 
for the years ended december   and  doral financial would have recognized million  million and million  respectively  in additional interest income had all delinquent loans been accounted for on an accrual basis 
this amount also includes interest reversal on loans placed on non accrual status during the year

under the new estimates  which were modified during the first quarter of  all fha va loans days past due are placed in non accrual and therefore  considered non performing assets 
during the first quarter of  the company changed its estimates for non accrual loans as a result of conforming the non accrual policies of its mortgage banking units to that of its banking subsidiaries  pursuant to which loans held for sale are placed on a non accrual basis after they are delinquent for more than days

table of contents non performing assets increased by million  or  during the increase in non performing assets was mainly driven by increases in delinquency within the residential mortgage portfolio  as a direct consequence of adverse macroeconomic trends in puerto rico 
delinquency within the residential mortgage portfolio was partially offset by improvement in the performance of the construction development portfolio 
during  the mix of non performing loans changed 
as of december   the majority of the non performing loans pertained to the residential mortgage portfolio  specifically 
the residential mortgage portfolio was followed by construction and land  which contributed of non performers 
as of the end of  the contribution of construction and land loans decreased to  while that of the residential mortgage increased to 
this trend in the non performing portfolio mix should result in relatively lower charge offs in future periods  arising from the fact that the construction and land portfolios have historically had significantly higher change offs than the residential mortgage portfolio 
as of december   non performing residential mortgage loans increased by million  or  compared to december  the increase in delinquency is mostly attributable to two main factors 
because of high geographical concentration of risk in puerto rico  doral borrowers have been subject to higher level of economic stress in macroeconomic pressure has significantly affected both early stage delinquency and cures from later delinquency segments 
deteriorating performance has affected the company s own portfolio as well as its billion portfolio of loans serviced for third parties 
non performing levels have also been affected by the natural aging of its and vintages  which reached their delinquency peaks in these vintages account for and of the total mortgage and non performing mortgage portfolios  respectively 
doral financial bears a lower credit risk on its mortgage portfolio when compared to other large scale mortgage bankers in the continental united states as a result of the characteristics of its portfolio 
doral financial does not hold a significant amount of adjustable interest rate  negative amortization  or other exotic credit features that are common in other parts of the united states 
substantially all residential mortgage loans are fixed rate  regular amortizing loans 
the following table shows the composition of the mortgage non performing loans according to their actual loan to value and whether they are covered by mortgage insurance

refer to paragraphs below for additional information on the assumptions used to establish general reserves for this portfolio 
as part of its regular collection and loss mitigation activities  as of december   the company has fully restructured million of mortgage loans 
a portion of these loans have proven repayment capacity for a sufficient amount of time and therefore  have been replaced in accruing status 
restructured loans amounting to million are yet to prove repayment capacity and or not complying with their modified contractual terms 
accordingly  the company continues to place them in non accrual status and reporting them as non performing within table bb above 
doral financial believes that the value of the oreo reflected on its consolidated statements of financial condition represents a reasonable estimate of the properties fair values  net of disposition costs 
the fair 
table of contents value of the oreo is normally determined on the basis of internal and external appraisals and physical inspections 
during  the company sold oreo properties  representing million in unpaid balance 
total proceeds amounted to million  representing the recovery of and of unpaid balance and book value  respectively 
during  non performing construction loans decreased by million  or  compared to december  the consolidated construction loan portfolio decreased by million  or  since december  the reduction in this portfolio was driven by a million decrease in the portfolio of construction loans to develop residential housing in puerto rico 
such decrease came as a result of an increased number of unit sales underlying the portfolio projects and regular portfolio run off 
during most of  several residential construction projects financed by the company experienced increased levels of unit sales  representing an aggregate repayment of million of principal 
the pick up in sales volume was mainly attributable to the incentives established by the government of puerto rico through law for buyers of newly constructed homes  in the form of a  down payment assistance and the company s own programs to assist builders to market and sell finished units 
although the tax credits available under law have expired  the company anticipates that the exposure to the residential construction sector will continue decreasing 
despite favorable activity during  the construction loan portfolio contributes of the company s total non performing loans 
this portfolio has been directly affected by the deterioration in the overall puerto rico economy because the underlying loans repayment capacity is dependent on the ability to attract home purchasers and maintain housing prices 
during most of the past two years  but especially during the latter part of  the company s portfolio experienced a significant increase in default rates resulting from borrowers not being able to sell finished units within the loan term 
as of december  and  and  respectively  of the loans within the construction portfolio were considered non performing loans 
although the company is taking steps to mitigate the credit risk underlying these loans  their ultimate performance will be affected by each borrower s ability to complete the project  maintain the pricing level of the housing units within the project  and sell the inventory of units within a reasonable timeframe 
during  doral financial did not enter into commitments to fund new construction loans in puerto rico for residential housing projects

as a result  the company increased its loan loss provisions to account for the increased levels of risk and their effect on the portfolio 
the company s allowance for loan and lease losses increased by million  or  between june  and december  as a result of the increase  the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans receivable increased from to between june  and december  during  puerto rico experienced deteriorating macroeconomics trends that contributed to continued increases in default levels in the retail business units 
portfolios underlying retail products including residential mortgage and small commercial real estate suffered significant increases in defaulted rates 
the portfolios entailing large commercial and residential construction loans  however  experienced improved performance in the company attributes improved performance to tightened workout efforts and the decision to interrupt lending within the residential construction sector in doral financial s provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended december   amounted to million  compared to million for the corresponding period 
the decrease in the provision is mostly driven by the fact that delinquency during was steadier than the delinquency and performance indicators of the corresponding period 
non performing loans as of december  increased by million  or  compared to december   while they increased by million  or  in the corresponding preceding period 
the decrease in provision is also attributed to the change in the mix of non performing loans experienced during the increase on non performing loans in was concentrated in the residential mortgage portfolio  whereas the increase in was concentrated within the construction portfolio 
historical charge offs experienced in the construction portfolio have been significantly higher than those of the residential portfolio  and therefore  the latter bears a lower inherent risk and lower expected severity losses 
the provision for was mainly driven by the request and receipt of several appraisals of real estate properties used as collateral on several of the portfolio s construction and large commercial loans 
these appraisals corresponded  to the most part  to loans that defaulted in although appraisals suggest a similar depreciation in collateral values  the volume of defaults was lower 
net charge offs for the year ended december  increased when compared to the corresponding period by million  or 
the increase was mostly driven by troubled loan relationships within the commercial and residential construction portfolios that had been identified and reserved for in earlier periods  including given the mature stage of its portfolio and the fact that new lending was discontinued in the fourth quarter of  the company expects that the residential construction portfolio will continue its current trend in which realized losses through charge offs are higher than current provisions 
higher charge off rates in the construction and commercial real estate portfolios during resulted in a 
table of contents decrease in the ratios of the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans and the corresponding ratio over non performing loans 
the resulted decrease is related to the fact that the charge offs decreased the loan allowance and total loan balance  including non performers  by the same amount 
should no charge offs had been executed  the coverage ratios would have amounted to and  respectively 
the company evaluates impaired loans and the related valuation allowance based on sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
commercial and construction loans over million that are classified as substandard are evaluated individually for impairment 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the borrower will not be able to fulfill its obligation according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the impairment loss  if any  on each individual loan identified as impaired is generally measured based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted and the loan s effective interest rate 
as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
if foreclosure is probable  the company is required to measure the impairment based on the fair value of the collateral 
the fair value of the collateral is generally obtained from appraisals 
should the appraisal show a deficiency  the company records a specific reserve for the underlying loan 
the following table summarizes the company s impaired loans and the related allowance year ended december  in thousands impaired loans with allowance impaired loans without allowance total impaired loans related allowance average impaired loans as part of the regular loan workout cycle  the doral financial charges off the portion of specific reserves for impaired loans that it considers to be confirmed losses 
accordingly  certain loans considered impaired and measured for specific reserve in accordance with sfas no 
are carried at an unpaid balance that has already been reduced by charge offs  and therefore  carry a relatively lower dollar allowance 
under some circumstances  the economics of a particular credit relationship suggest that the underlying loans are sufficiently collateralized and that no specific reserve is necessary 
sfas no 
prohibits the allocation of general reserves for those loans for which an impairment analysis has been conducted and for which no specific reserve is required 
as of december   doral financial construction and commercial real estate portfolio includes million of impaired loans that are adequately collateralized and  accordingly  carry no specific reserves 
doral financial records an allowance for small balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages  consumer  commercial and construction loans under million on a group basis under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for contingencies sfas no 

for such loans  the allowance is determined considering the historical charge off experience of each loan category and delinquency levels as well as economic data  such as interest rate levels  inflation and the strength of the housing market in the areas where the company operates 
the general allowance for residential mortgage loans is calculated based on the probability that loans within different delinquency buckets will default and  in the case of default  the extent of losses that the company expects to realize 
in determining the probabilities of default  the company considers recent experience of rolls of loans from one delinquency bucket into the next 
the roll rates for show that the proportion of loans rolling into subsequent buckets followed an increasing trend throughout the year 
for purposes of forecasting the future behavior of the portfolio  doral financial determined that it should only use the roll rates of relatively recent months  which show a more aggressive deteriorating trend that those in the first half of using the older historical performance would yield lower probabilities of default that may not reflect recent macroeconomic trends 
severity losses are calculated based on historical results 
table of contents from foreclosure and ultimate disposition of collateral 
historical results are adjusted for the company s expectation of housing prices 
severity assumptions for the residential portfolio range between and depending on the different loan types and loan to value ratios 
generally  the percentage of the allowance for loan and lease losses to non performing loans will not remain constant due to the nature of doral financial s portfolio of loans  which are primarily collateralized by real estate 
the collateral for each non performing mortgage loan is analyzed to determine potential loss exposure  and  in conjunction with other factors  this loss exposure contributes to the overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
on an ongoing basis  management monitors the loan portfolio and evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance  management considers such factors as default probabilities  internal risk ratings based on borrowers financial stability  external credit ratings  management strength  earnings and operating environment  probable loss and recovery rates  and the degree of risk inherent in the loan portfolios 
allocated specific and general reserves are supplemented by a macroeconomic or emerging risk reserve 
this portion of the total allowance for loan and lease losses reflects management s evaluation of conditions that are not directly reflected in the loss factors used in the determination of the allowance 
the conditions evaluated in connection with the macroeconomic and emerging risk allowance include national and local economic trends  industry conditions within the portfolios  recent loan portfolio performance  loan growth  changes in underwriting criteria and the regulatory and public policy environment 
the following table sets forth information concerning the composition of doral financial s allowance for loan and lease losses by loan category and whether the allowance and related provisions were calculated individually through the requirements of sfas no

provisions for loan and lease losses are charged to expenses and credited to the allowance in amounts deemed appropriate by management based upon its evaluation of the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio

general business  economic and political conditions the company s business and earnings are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in puerto rico and the united states 
significant business and economic conditions include short and long term interest rates  inflation and the strength of the puerto rico and us economies and housing markets 
if any of these conditions deteriorate  the company s business and earnings could be adversely affected 
for example  business and economic conditions that negatively impact household income could decrease the demand for residential mortgage loans and increase the number of customers who become delinquent or default on their loans  or  a dramatically rising interest rate environment could decrease the demand for loans 
inflation also generally results in increases in general and administrative expenses 
interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
please refer to risk management above for a discussion of the effects of changes of interest rates on doral financial s operations

miscellaneous changes in accounting standards adopted in the financial statements fair value measurements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
the definition of fair value retains the exchange price notion in earlier definitions of fair value 
this statement clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or 
table of contents liability 
the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability is a hypothetical transaction at the measurement date  considered from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability 
therefore  the definition focuses on the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability at the measurement date an exit price  not the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability at the measurement date an entry price 
this statement emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
therefore  a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  this statement establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 
the notion of unobservable inputs is intended to allow for situations in which there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date 
in those situations  the reporting entity need not undertake all possible efforts to obtain information about market participant assumptions 
however  the reporting entity must not ignore information about market participant assumptions that is reasonably available without undue cost and effort 
this statement expands disclosures about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition 
the disclosures focus on the inputs used to measure fair value and for recurring fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs within level of the fair value hierarchy  the effect of the measurements on earnings or changes in net assets for the period 
this statement encourages entities to combine the fair value information disclosed under this statement with the fair value information disclosed under other accounting pronouncements  including fasb statement no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  where practicable 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
on january   the company adopted this statement on its consolidated financial statements with no material impact 
determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
the fsp clarifies the application of sfas no 
in an inactive market and illustrates how an entity would determine fair value when the market for a financial asset is not active 
the fsp states that an entity should not automatically conclude that a particular transaction price is determinative of fair value 
in a dislocated market  judgment is required to evaluate whether individual transactions are forced liquidations or distressed sales 
when relevant observable market information is not available  a valuation approach that incorporates management s judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset in a current sale transaction would be acceptable 
the fsp also indicates that quotes from brokers or pricing services may be relevant inputs when measuring fair value  but are not necessarily determinative in the absence of an active market for the asset 
in weighing a broker quote as an input to a fair value measurement  an entity should place less reliance on quotes that do not reflect the result of market transactions 
further  the nature of the quote for example  whether the quote is an indicative price or a binding offer should be considered when weighing the available evidence 
the fsp is effective immediately  and for prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
revisions resulting from a change in the valuation technique or its application should be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate following the guidance in fasb statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
accordingly  we adopted the fsp prospectively  beginning july  the adoption of this statement impacted the valuation methodology of some of the company s investment securities

sfas no 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which 
table of contents provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
it also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
the new statement does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in fasb statements no 
 fair value measurements  and no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
sfas no

the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
this statement identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with gaap in the united states the gaap hierarchy 
the current gaap hierarchy  as set forth in the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement on auditing standards no 
 the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  has been criticized because it is directed to the auditor rather than the entity  it is complex  and it ranks fasb statements of financial accounting concepts  which are subject to the same level of due process as fasb statements of financial accounting standards  below industry practices that are widely recognized as generally accepted but that are not subject to due process 
the fasb believes that the gaap hierarchy should be directed to entities because it is the entity not its auditor that is responsible for selecting accounting principles for financial statements that are presented in conformity with gaap 
accordingly  the fasb concluded that the gaap hierarchy should reside in the accounting literature established by the fasb and issued this statement to achieve that result 
there is no expectation that this statement will result in a change in current practice 
however  transition provisions have been provided by the fasb in the unusual circumstance that the application of the provisions of this statement results in a change in practice 
this statement is effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company is currently evaluating the effect  if any  of the adoption of this statement on its consolidated financial statements 
amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no 
in january  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
eitf  amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no 

this fsp amends the impairment guidance in eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets  to achieve more consistent determination of whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
this fsp aligns the impairment model of issue no 
with that of fasb statement  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
sfas requires entities to assess whether it is probable that the holder will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms 
the fsp eliminates the requirement to consider market participants views of cash flows of a security in determining whether or not impairment has occurred 
the fsp is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after december   and must be applied prospectively 
earlier application is not permitted
