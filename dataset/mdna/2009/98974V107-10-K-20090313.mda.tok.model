item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including but not limited to those set forth in risk factors in item a of part i of this report and elsewhere in this report 
except as otherwise required by law  we do not intend to update any information contained in these forward looking statements 
overview general we are a full service residential real estate brokerage firm  using our user friendly website and employee real estate agents to provide homebuyers and sellers with high quality service and value 
our website provides users with access to comprehensive local multiple listing services home listings data  as well as other relevant market and neighborhood information 
our proprietary business management system and technology platform help to reduce costs  allowing us to pass on significant savings to consumers as permitted by law 
we typically share a portion of our commissions with our buyer clients in the form of a cash rebate  and typically represent our seller clients at fee levels below those offered by most traditional brokerage companies in our markets 
generally  our seller clients pay a total brokerage fee of to of the transaction value  of which to is paid to agents representing buyers 
our net revenues are composed primarily of commissions earned as agents for buyers and sellers in residential real estate transactions 
we record revenues net of rebate or  in new jersey  net of charitable donation until april  or commission discount  if any  paid or offered to our clients 
our net revenues are principally driven by the number of transactions we close and the average net revenue per transaction 
average net revenue per transaction is a function of the home sales price and percentage commission we receive on each transaction and varies significantly by market 
we also receive revenues from certain co marketing arrangements  such as mortgage lenders to whom we provide access through the mortgage center on our website  who typically pay us a flat monthly fee that is established on a periodic basis 
generally  non commission revenues represent less than of our net revenues during any period 
we routinely explore our options for entering into additional co marketing arrangements or offering other services related to the purchase  sale and ownership of a home and have begun offering property and casualty insurance including auto insurance services through a subsidiary 
we believe that customer acquisition is one of our core competencies  and while we anticipate that the difficulty of acquiring a sufficient number of leads online may increase over time  we expect that we can mitigate some of that impact with repeat and referral business  as well as by increasing our visibility and credibility to potential clients over time 
since our market share has averaged less than over the past year in our existing markets in aggregate  we believe that there is an opportunity to increase further our market share  even if the overall level of sales continue to decline due to changing consumer sentiment  interest rate increases  credit tightening  or other economic or geopolitical factors 
we were founded in  currently have operations in markets  and as of december  employed  people  of whom  were zipagents

during we commenced operations in long island in march and hartford in july and depending on market conditions  we have plans to enter up to two additional markets during  including our previously announced entry into the portland  oregon market 

table of contents trends in our business and financial and real estate markets decline in the residential real estate market 
although our business has experienced increasing revenue growth and transaction volume on an annual basis since our inception in  in the past few years our business has been negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions that have resulted in slower revenue growth and a decline in average net revenue per transaction 
the residential real estate market began to soften in the fall of as mortgages consequently went into default  lender underwriting criteria tightened  which reduced homebuyers ability to obtain acceptable funding for home purchases  further dampening the residential real estate market 
the tightening of credit has also resulted in lower closing yields as transactions fail to close  creating a further downward pressure on home prices 
we believe that the recent increase in the unemployment rate  together with greater job insecurity and a further decline in consumer confidence on a macroeconomic level  have added additional downward pressure on home prices and have impacted our closing yields 
other factors have likely contributed to the slowdown as well  including volatility in fuel prices  and the fact that home prices prior to this slowdown had been increasing at historically high rates  well ahead of household income growth 
currently  we have little visibility into when the residential real estate market will stabilize  and in which markets that stabilization will first occur 
the residential real estate market may continue to soften in the foreseeable future  particularly given the recent crisis in the financial and banking industries 
we may continue to experience slower growth rates versus our historical levels as buyers react cautiously to challenging market conditions 
the current indications we have concerning the health of the residential real estate market include the following a high percentage of our sales volume is composed of distressed properties  that is  homes that are in foreclosure or short sales  meaning a sale where the sale price is less than the loans or debt secured by the home listed for sale 
in  approximately of our sales consisted of distressed properties 
we expect distressed properties to continue to represent a significant portion of our business in the foreseeable future 
distressed properties not only tend to sell at reduced prices  but they also tend to put downward pressure on the values of other homes for sale in their neighborhoods 
nationally  home sales prices have declined  and home sales volumes have flattened  which continues to result in high inventories of homes available for sale 
according to the national association of realtors  or nar  the national median home price decreased year over year in december months of inventory levels in december decreased modestly from levels in december  and high inventories persist as the annual rate of existing home sales decreased year over year in december to a seasonally adjusted rate of million 
for all of existing home sales declined 
evidence suggests a turnaround in some markets  particularly where home prices have already dropped dramatically 
for example  in california  the california association of realtors reported that the median home price decreased by year over year in december but  inversely  that home sales increased year over year in december the number of licensed real estate agents continues to decline 
nar has reported that its total membership of realtors fell approximately from january  to january  in california  nar has reported that its total membership fell approximately during the same period 
if the current state of the residential real estate market does not improve materially  we expect to see a further reduction in the number of licensed realtors nationwide and in our largest markets 
we expect that overall declines in agent ranks will be comprised disproportionately of less skilled real estate agents  with the better agents continuing in the business 
we also expect that the prolonged market distress may deal a critical blow to some of our competitors 
it is our hope that these events  if they occur  will increase the percentage of highly skilled real estate agents on the market  and reduce the competition for such agents  but we cannot know whether this result will occur  or whether the overall decline in the number of real estate agents will make it more difficult for us to employ qualified agents and grow our business 

table of contents impact of availability of home loans on residential real estate market 
we believe that the availability of home loans is critical to the residential real estate market 
currently  we perceive credit standards  including mortgage lending standards  to be tight 
we believe this tightness was caused by a multi year softness in the residential real estate market beginning in late  followed by unexpectedly high mortgage defaults and related losses by lenders and investors on mortgages and mortgage backed securities  which  at least in part  resulted in a crisis in the financial markets and a related banking shock in the second half of we perceive that investors  who buy loans and securities backed by mortgages  are tightening credit standards and or exiting the market for loans that aren t guaranteed by the federal national mortgage association or fannie mae or the federal home loan mortgage corporation or freddie mac  the two largest corporations that purchase closed loans from mortgage lenders 
consequently  more lenders currently require homebuyers to have higher credit scores and to provide greater down payments than in recent years 
meeting these requirements has been more difficult as stock prices have plummeted  decreasing the values of homebuyers retirement accounts and investments 
we have also perceived an increase in lenders requests that homebuyers obtain mortgage insurance  particularly as second mortgages and home equity loans become harder to obtain 
further  an entire group of loan products  including subprime and some alt a loans  have become less available and  in some markets  almost nonexistent 
following suit are prime  non conforming loans  principally loans of more than  through december   making them significantly more costly than in previous years relative to conforming loans meaning loans with sizes that do not exceed the maximum amounts that may be purchased by fannie mae and freddie mac 
although congress has enacted legislation to improve the availability of mortgages  there can be no assurance that such improvement will happen 
in addition  fannie mae and freddie mac  who together guarantee or own approximately half of the total home mortgages in the united states  have played critical roles in the national housing market by supplying significant liquidity in the market for mortgage lending and buying 
in the second half of  fannie mae and freddie mac experienced significant losses due  at least in part  to the macroeconomic conditions described above  followed by a precipitous drop in their stock prices as investors lost confidence in the future health and viability of those entities 
as discussed in more detail below  the federal government placed these institutions into conservatorship in the fall of  in part to help stabilize the mortgage market 
if either fannie mae or freddie mac ceases  or significantly curtails  its mortgage lending and buying activities  the availability of mortgages to potential homebuyers  and consequently the residential real estate market  could worsen significantly 
federal efforts to bolster the residential real estate market 
during  the federal government and related agencies acted repeatedly to address the decline in the residential real estate market and the tightening in the home mortgage industry 
for example in the first quarter of  federal legislation was enacted that  among other objectives  attempted to bolster the market for home loans by raising the loan amount that qualifies as a conforming loan up to a maximum of  in certain markets 
in early  this legislation was extended through december in july  the president signed the housing and economic recovery act of  which introduced several initiatives aimed at helping to shore up the real estate market 
these provisions included a limited first time home buyer s income tax credit of up to  prohibitions against certain seller funded down payment assistance programs  beginning october   a permanent increase in the conforming loan limit up to the greater of  or of the local area median home price  capped at  a permanent increase in the federal housing administration or fha loan limit to the greater of  and of the local area median home price  capped at  an fha foreclosure rescue plan  designed to assist homebuyers with problematic loans  temporary increases in the veterans administration or va loan limit  and authorization for the treasury department to make 
table of contents loans to and buy stock from fannie mae and freddie mac 
during the third quarter of  the government announced several steps taken with respect to fannie mae and freddie mac in order to shore up their capital positions and provide liquidity to the mortgage market  including placing fannie mae and freddie mac in conservatorship in september in early october  the president signed the emergency economic stabilization act of  which authorized the treasury secretary treasury to establish the troubled assets relief program tarp to  among other things  purchase troubled assets from financial institutions and help stabilize and provide liquidity to the credit markets 
later that month  treasury announced a program pursuant to tarp to invest capital in certain banking institutions to improve their solvency and foster additional lending 
in february  the president signed the american recovery and reinvestment act of  which included additional provisions to bolster the real estate market 
these provisions include a first time home buyer s income tax credit of up to  with no repayment requirement  an increase to the limit for loans provided through fannie mae and freddie mac to  and restoration of the floor for fha loan guarantee programs in normal markets to  with discretion for the secretary of housing to approve fha backed loans of up to of the median home price in high cost markets up to  in february  the president introduced a plan to reduce home foreclosures by  among other things  offering incentives to lenders that provide loan modifications to homeowners in danger of foreclosure and granting bankruptcy judges the power to modify loan terms for homeowners in bankruptcy 
in addition  throughout and early the federal reserve board  or frb  has acted repeatedly to make additional funds available to banks and financial institutions  including by making loans  buying unsecured short term debt  and buying mortgage related assets 
the frb regulates the supply of money in the united states  including through the extension of credit to banks and other financial institutions  and its actions often have a significant impact on interest rates 
the frb typically has the power to act independently of congress 
while we believe the steps taken with respect to fannie mae and freddie mac to shore up their capital positions and to provide liquidity to the mortgage market are positive  it is too early for us to assess whether the federal activities described above will have a positive and meaningful impact on stabilizing the banking and financial industries  on the availability of credit  on spurring first time homebuyers to purchase a home  and on the overall residential housing market changes to our business model 
over time  we have made significant adjustments to our cost structure and revenue model in order to improve the financial results of our business  including to the compensation and expense reimbursement structure for zipagents 
currently  our zipagents earn a compensation package consisting of a percentage of the commissions they generate for us that ranges from to or more  based on their productivity  of our net revenues  after deducting certain other items 
we also provide our zipagents with health  retirement and other benefits  subject to meeting certain tenure requirements and pay for certain marketing costs and other business expenses 
zipagents may also be granted equity incentives based on performance 
we may choose or be required to make further modifications to our compensation structure in the future 
for example  nevada approved legislation that preempts the federal outside sales exemption from paying minimum wages in that state 
accordingly  on november  we began paying minimum wage and  where required  overtime pay  to our zipagents in nevada 
the minimum wage payments will be offset against future commissions earned  if any 
we have lowered our buyer rebate percentage several times to improve our revenue model 
we implemented these buyer rebate percentage reductions for several reasons  including our determination that our growing reputation for superior service allowed us not to compete solely on price  our efforts to improve our revenue model and agent compensation model  and our desire to offer a simplified rebate structure to our clients 
during early  we plan to cease offering a rebate in transactions valued at less than  
table of contents in connection with entry into the greater philadelphia area in december  we entered the new jersey market  where the payment of cash rebates is currently not permitted by law 
consequently  we do not offer a rebate to our clients in new jersey 
in lieu of offering a cash rebate to our buyers in new jersey  we make a donation to a local charity through united way equal to of our commissions  although we plan to discontinue this practice effective april  in  we plan to launch our portland market to serve portions of oregon and washington 
rebates are prohibited under oregon law and  thus  we will not offer our rebate to clients in the portland market 
we plan to adjust our pricing structure and or value proposition for our buyers serviced in our portland market 
historically  most of our business has been derived from representing buyers in their home purchases 
one of our growth strategies is to increase the portion of our business that is composed of representing sellers in their home listings 
if this strategy succeeds  and the portion of our listings business increases  and as listings take longer to sell in a market with higher inventory levels  marketing costs generally increase  and commissions can decrease as buyers demand more last minute concessions in price before closing 
if the softened market persists  we may incur greater listing marketing costs and achieve lower commissions and lower profit margins 
fluctuations in quarterly profitability 
since first achieving profitability in the first quarter of  we have experienced fluctuations in profitability from period to period 
our profitability has been impacted by various factors including seasonality  new market expansion  legal settlements  ongoing market challenges and tightening in the availability of home mortgage credit 
industry changes in commission percentages 
according to real trends  average commission percentages charged in the real estate brokerage industry declined from in to to although they subsequently increased in and to and  respectively 
total commission revenues increased from billion to billion from to and decreased to billion and billion in and  respectively 
in the event that commission revenues continue to decline  we have designed our business model around an attractive cost structure and operational efficiencies which we believe should allow us to continue to offer our services at prices less than those charged by the majority of our competitors 
changes in competitive landscape 
the competitive landscape in the residential real estate industry is in the midst of significant changes as new business models enter the marketplace 
for example  redfin corporation has introduced a discount brokerage model that allows clients to make offers to purchase homes and to list homes for sale directly online  while receiving a two thirds rebate of their commission 
realestate 
com  which is owned by lendingtree  llc  acts as a lead generator for real estate brokers  and has opened a direct to consumer brokerage service 
trulia  inc operates a residential real estate search engine to connect consumers directly to listings on agent and broker websites 
these companies have limited operating histories upon which to evaluate their operations and future prospects 
however  we believe these companies  as well as ours  reflect that the real estate industry is experiencing  and will continue to experience  significant changes due  in part  to the introduction of new technologies  new businesses  and new business models 
in order to be successful  our services must remain attractive to consumers so that we can compete successfully with these newer models as they expand into our marketplaces 
in addition  to remain economically viable  we will need to be able to compete effectively with these new entrants for the acquisition of agents and customers 
industry seasonality and cyclicality 
the residential real estate brokerage market is influenced both by annual seasonality factors  as well as by overall economic cycles 
while individual markets vary  transaction volume nationally tends to progressively increase from january through the summer months  then gradually slows over the last three to four months of the calendar year 
revenues in each quarter are significantly affected by activity during the prior quarter  given the typical to day time lag between contract execution and closing for traditional home purchases 
for non traditional sales  the time lag from contract execution to closing can be a few months 
we have been  and believe we will continue to be  influenced by overall market activity and seasonal forces 
we generally experience the most significant impact in the first and fourth quarters of each 
table of contents year  when our revenues are typically lower relative to the second and third quarters as a result of traditionally slower home sales activity and reduced listings inventory between thanksgiving and presidents day 
the impact of seasonality can be masked by the general health of the residential real estate market at any given point in time  whether affected by macroeconomic events  periodic business cycles or other factors 
generally  when economic times are fair or good  the housing market tends to perform well 
if the economy is weak  if interest rates dramatically increase  if mortgage lending standards tighten  or if there are disturbances such as terrorist attacks or threats  the outbreak of war or geopolitical uncertainties  the housing market likely would be negatively impacted 
historical variations in us interest rates 
over the past several decades  the national residential real estate market has demonstrated significant growth  with annual existing home sales volume growing from million in to approximately million in and median existing home sales prices increasing every year during that period 
between and  the volume of existing home sales had declined for at least two consecutive years only twice since  namely through and through we are currently in such a period of decline 
sales have fallen from their peak to approximately million in and fell again in to approximately million 
sales volume changes are sensitive to  but do not always follow  interest rate changes 
the declines in sales volumes in the through period occurred while interest rates were at historic highs  with long term us treasury rates exceeding 
however  with rates remaining at similarly high levels  sales increased during the period from through average interest rates were lower during the second period of consecutive year declines  through  than they had been in the expansion period ending in critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and of those policies  we believe that the following accounting policies involve the greatest degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we derive the substantial majority of our revenues from commissions earned as agents for buyers and sellers in residential real estate transactions 
we recognize commission revenues upon closing of a sale and purchase transaction  net of any rebate or commission discount  or transaction fee adjustment  as evidenced when the escrow or similar account has closed and transaction documents have been recorded and funds disbursed to all appropriate parties 
we recognize non commission revenues from our other business relationships  such as lender marketing relationships  as the fees are earned from the other party typically on a monthly fee basis 
internal use software and website development costs we account for internal use software and website development costs  including the development of our zipagent platform  in accordance with the guidance set forth in statement of position  accounting for the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  and emerging task force issue no 
 accounting for website development costs 
we capitalize the payroll and direct payroll related costs of employees who devote time to the development of internal use software 
we amortize these costs over their 
table of contents estimated useful lives  which typically range between to months 
our judgment is required in determining the point at which various projects enter the stages at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs  and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized 
the estimated life is based on management s judgment as to the product life cycle 
stock based compensation we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases  based on estimated fair values 
under the fair value recognition provisions for sfas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and recognized as expense using the straight line method over the requisite service period of the award 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model  which incorporates various assumptions including volatility  expected life and interest rates 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock and consideration of other relevant factors such as the volatility of guideline companies 
the expected life of options is estimated by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option as provided by staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
we estimate expected forfeitures based on various factors including employee class and historical experience 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates are revised 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax amounts are determined by using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received  as provided under current tax law 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense or benefit is the tax payable or refundable  respectively  for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent historical results and our expectations for the future 
historically  we have recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  the majority of which relate to net operating loss carryforwards and we maintain that a full valuation allowance should be accounted for against our net deferred tax assets at december

the recorded carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to their short maturities and short term investments are carried at fair value 
the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument is limited 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  particularly since the majority of our investments are fixed income investments 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately and uniformly by from levels at december  and  the increase or decline in fair market value of the portfolio would be approximately million and million  respectively
