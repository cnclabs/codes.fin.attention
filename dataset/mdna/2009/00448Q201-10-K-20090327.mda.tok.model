item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative treatments for infectious diseases 
within the anti infective market  we are currently concentrating on the development of antivirals for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c and the development of antibacterials for the treatment of resistant bacterial infections 
we are currently focusing our efforts on advancing two late stage preclinical candidates ach  an nsa antagonist for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c  being developed in collaboration with gilead sciences  inc  or gilead  and ach  a protease inhibitor also for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c 
in addition  we have established a pipeline of certain other product candidates for which we are currently seeking appropriate collaborative partners or for which we are considering to seek appropriate collaborative partners but to which we are not devoting significant resources at this time 
these product candidates include elvucitabine for the treatment of hiv infection  and ach for the treatment of serious bacterial infections 
we have devoted and are continuing to devote substantially all of our efforts toward product research and development 
we have incurred losses of million from inception through december  and had an accumulated deficit of million through december  our net losses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have funded our operations primarily through proceeds of million from the sale of equity securities  including our initial public offering in october and a private placement of our common stock in august  borrowings of million from debt facilities  and receipts of million from up front and milestone payments  as well as million in cost sharing receipts  from our collaboration partner  gilead 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for at least the next several years as we seek to complete late stage preclinical studies and initiate clinical testing of ach  initiate clinical testing of ach  complete the open label extension phases of our phase ii clinical trials for elvucitabine  and progress additional drug candidates 
we will need substantial additional financing to obtain regulatory approvals  fund operating losses  and  if deemed appropriate  establish manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities  which we will seek to raise through public or private equity or debt financings  collaborative or other arrangements with third parties or through other sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
in addition to the normal risks associated with early stage companies  there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete our research and development  obtain adequate patent protection for our technology  obtain necessary government regulatory approval for drug candidates we develop or that any approved drug candidates will be commercially viable 
in addition  we may not be profitable even if we succeed in commercializing any of our drug candidates 
on august   in a private placement we issued to certain institutional investors  units at a price of per unit  resulting in gross proceeds of million  or million net of offering expenses 
each unit consists of one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
additionally  the investors may have the option to purchase an additional  units between february and august  potentially resulting in additional proceeds and subject to certain contingencies 
we have agreed to seek stockholder approval for the transaction in accordance with nasdaq marketplace rules 

table of contents financial operations overview revenue to date  we have not generated revenue from the sale of any drugs 
the majority of our revenue recognized to date has been derived from our collaboration with gilead to develop compounds for use in treating chronic hepatitis c 
during the years ended december   and we recognized  million and million  respectively  under this collaboration agreement 
upon initiating our collaboration with gilead  we received a payment of million  which included an equity investment by gilead determined to be worth approximately million 
the remaining million is being accounted for as a nonrefundable up front fee recognized under the proportionate performance model 
revenue under the proportionate performance model is recognized as our effort under the collaboration is incurred 
payments made by us to gilead in connection with this collaboration are being recognized as a reduction of revenue 
when our performance obligation is complete  we will recognize milestone payments  if any  when the corresponding milestone is achieved 
we will recognize royalty payments  if any  upon product sales 
effective april   each party provides for the costs of their own full time equivalents 
external research costs continue to be shared equally by both parties 
through march  research and development expenses under our collaboration with gilead  including internal full time equivalent costs and external research costs  incurred by both companies prior to proof of concept  were borne equally by both parties 
as we were providing the majority of those services and were incurring the majority of those expenses  we were the net recipient of funds under this cost sharing portion of the arrangement and therefore recognized the reimbursed costs as revenue rather than research expense 
for the quarter ended december   gilead incurred a greater amount of external costs  therefore we were a net payor of funds to gilead under this portion of the arrangement 
we recognize revenue related to our gilead arrangement using the proportionate performance method 
under the proportionate performance method  periodic revenue related to up front license payments is recognized as the percentage of actual effort expended in that period to total effort expected for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
actual effort is generally determined based upon actual direct labor hours or full time equivalents incurred and include research and development activities performed by internal scientists 
total expected effort is generally based upon the total direct labor hours of full time equivalents incorporated into the detailed budget and project plan that is agreed to by both parties to the collaboration 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete the related performance obligations 
under our arrangement with gilead sciences  the joint research committee periodically reviews and updates the project plan 
in the event that a change in estimate occurs  the change will be accounted for using the cumulative catch up method which provides for an adjustment to revenue in the current period 
estimates of our level of effort may change in the future  resulting in a material change in the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
for example  the most recent project plan agreed upon by the joint research committee resulted in an increase to our total efforts under the collaboration and extended our estimated obligation period under the collaboration to the second half of  resulting in an adjustment to our proportion of completed performance 
this change in estimate caused a non cash reduction in amounts previously recognized as revenue under the collaboration resulting in negative revenue for the fourth quarter of research and development our research and development expenses reflect costs incurred for our proprietary research and development projects as well as costs for research and development projects conducted as part of collaborative arrangements we establish 
these costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits for our research and development personnel  costs of services by clinical research organizations  other outsourced research  materials used during research and development activities  facility related costs such as rent and utilities associated with our laboratory and clinical development space  operating supplies and other costs associated with our research and development activities 

table of contents we expect a slight reduction in research and development expenses over the next twelve months as a result of the reduction of expenses related to the near completion of the phase ii clinical program for elvucitabine  the reduction of expenses relating to ach and the termination of our collaboration agreement with fob synthesis  offset by increased expenses related to the initiation of human clinical trials for ach and ach all costs associated with internal research and development  and research and development services for which we have externally contracted  are expensed as incurred 
the costs of obtaining and maintaining patents for our candidates are expensed as incurred as indirect costs 
our research and development expenses are outlined in the table below 
for the years ended in thousands direct external costs nsa antagonists including ach and ach ach ach elvucitabine direct internal personnel costs sub total direct costs indirect costs and overhead total research and development currently  we are initiating clinical studies for ach and ach and completing the open label extension phases of two phase ii clinical trials for elvucitabine 
from inception through december   we incurred approximately million in total costs for our nsa antagonist program  including both ach and ach  approximately million for ach  approximately million in total costs for ach and approximately million in total costs for elvucitabine 
these figures include our internal research and development personnel costs and related facilities overhead 
we anticipate that the future expense associated with early clinical development through proof of concept of ach  our next generation nsa antagonist  will total approximately million  exclusive of internal personnel costs 
our portion of this expense is anticipated to be million  which represents one half of the external costs associated with those activities  as we share such external costs with gilead 
we estimate that the costs associated with early clinical development of ach  our hcv protease inhibitor  will be approximately million  exclusive of internal personnel costs 
we are currently assessing our strategic and development plans for ach and considering whether to undertake such development independently or with a collaborative partner 
we currently estimate that the clinical trial costs for two phase iii clinical trials of elvucitabine in different hiv populations will be approximately million  exclusive of the internal personnel costs associated with conducting these trials  however  we currently do not plan to undertake these two phase iii trials for elvucitabine unless or until we enter into a collaboration agreement 
the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our drug candidates 
we are also unable to predict when  if ever  material net cash inflows will commence from elvucitabine or any early stage programs 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and expense of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  
table of contents the potential benefits of our drug candidates over other therapies  in the case of our hcv inhibitors involving nsa antagonism  the rate at which our collaboration partner  gilead  is able to complete preclinical and clinical trials  and the degree to which gilead prioritizes those trials over its other development efforts  our ability to market  commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any of our drug candidates that we are developing or may develop in the future  future clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the expense and timing of regulatory approvals  and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
a change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our drug candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate 
for example  if the fda or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate will be required to complete clinical development of a drug candidate  or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials  we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
we expect expenses associated with the completion of these programs to be substantial and increase 
we do not believe  however  that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program specific expenses through commercialization 
there exist numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our drug candidates  including future trial design and various regulatory requirements  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development 
additionally  future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will evolve and therefore impact our clinical development programs and plans over time 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for management and administrative personnel  professional fees for legal  accounting and other services  travel costs and facility related costs such as rent  utilities and other general office expenses 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will remain substantially unchanged over the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth below are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those described below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management makes estimates and exercises judgment in revenue recognition  research and development costs  stock based compensation and accrued expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue from contract research and development and research progress payments in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab no 
 and financial accounting standards board  or fasb  emerging issue task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf no 
revenue generating research and development collaborations are often multiple element arrangements  providing for a license as well as research and development services 
such arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  including research and development services  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf no 
we recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have standalone value or ii have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the upfront license payments are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when our performance obligations are performed 
when we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue related to upfront license payments will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a proportionate performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
under the proportionate performance method  periodic revenue related to up front license payments is recognized as the percentage of actual effort expended in that period to total effort expected for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
actual effort is generally determined based upon actual direct labor hours or full time equivalents incurred and include research and development activities performed by internal scientists 
total expected effort is generally based upon the total direct labor hours of full time equivalents incorporated into the detailed budget and project plan that is agreed to by both parties to the collaboration 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete the related performance obligations 
for example  under our arrangement with gilead sciences  the joint research committee periodically reviews and updates the project plan 
in the event that a change in estimate occurs  the change will be accounted for using the cumulative catch up method which provides for an adjustment to revenue in the current period 
estimates of our level of effort may change in the future  resulting in a material change in the amount of revenue recognized in future periods  including negative revenue in some periods 
we revised our joint research program with gilead in the first quarter of to focus on next generation nsa antagonists 
at that time  we extended the period over which our remaining obligations under the arrangement would be completed 
we and gilead also agreed to continue to equally share external costs  but effective april   internal full time equivalents would no longer be subject to a cost sharing arrangement 
instead  each party bears the costs of their respective full time equivalents 
in addition  we also revised our joint research program with gilead in the first quarter of to include a more complete series of preclinical studies  thereby increasing our total estimated efforts under the collaboration and extending the estimated period over which our remaining obligations under the arrangement would be completed to the second half of this change in estimate caused a non cash reduction in amounts previously recognized as revenue under the collaboration resulting in negative revenue for the fourth quarter of generally under collaboration arrangements  payments received during the period of performance may include up front payments  time or performance based milestones and reimbursement of internal and external 
table of contents costs 
the proportion of actual performance to total expected performance is applied to these payments in determining periodic revenue  but will be limited by the aggregate cash received or receivable to date by us 
substantive milestone payments are considered to be performance bonuses that are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone and a reasonable amount of time passes between the upfront license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment 
reimbursement of costs is recognized as revenue provided the provisions of eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as principal versus net as an agent  are met  the amounts are determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
stock based compensation employee stock based awards we apply the statement of financial accounting standards no 
as revised in  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  which requires measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases under our espp plan based on estimated fair values 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab no 
 which extends the use of the simplified method in developing an estimate of the expected term of plain vanilla share options beyond december  due to our limited exercise history and period of time that our shares have been publicly traded  we utilize the provisions of sab in our application of sfas r 
we primarily grant qualified stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the market value of the shares at the date of grant 
to the extent that the amount of the aggregate fair market value of qualified stock options that become exercisable for an individual exceeds  during any tax year  those stock options are treated as non qualified stock options 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is based on the value of the portion of stock based awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the years ended december  and includes compensation expense for stock based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the fair value on the grant date estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas no 
compensation expense also includes amounts related to the stock based awards granted subsequent to december   based on the fair value on the grant date  estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
the black scholes model requires the use of assumptions which determine the fair value of the stock based awards 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  we previously accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we are required to estimate forfeitures at the grant date and recognize compensation costs for only those awards that are expected to vest 
judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas no 
r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
therefore  we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under sfas no 
r 
there is risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant 
table of contents dates may differ from the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with sfas no 
r and sab no 
using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
total compensation expense recorded in the accompanying statements of operations associated with option grants made to employees for the years ended december   and was million  million and  respectively 
we recorded no tax benefit related to these options since we currently maintain a full valuation allowance 
as of december   the total compensation cost related to nonvested options not yet recognized in the financial statements is approximately million  net of estimated forfeitures  and the weighted average period over which it is expected to be recognized is years 
as of december   the intrinsic value of the options outstanding was accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period 
if the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
some of our service providers require upfront or milestone payments 
if our estimate of services performed is less than the upfront or milestone payments  the difference is accounted for as a prepaid expense 
in the event that we do not identify costs that have been incurred or we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses could differ from such estimates 
the date on which some services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
we make judgments based upon facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with us gaap 
income taxes we use an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax basis assets and liabilities and are measured by applying enacted rates and laws to taxable years in which differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
further  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the rate changes 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return  including a decision whether to file or not file a return in a particular jurisdiction 
under fin  the financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 

table of contents we do not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption or december  we review all tax positions to ensure the tax treatment selected is sustainable based on its technical merits and that the position would be sustained if challenged 
results of operations results of operations may vary from period to period depending on numerous factors  including the timing of payments received under existing or future strategic alliances  joint ventures or financings  if any  the progress of our research and development projects  technological advances and determinations as to the commercial potential of proposed products 
revenues our sources of revenue during the years ended december   and consist primarily of gilead collaboration revenue

it is possible that we will recognize negative revenue in future quarters based upon the timing of our performance under the collaboration  and on the timing and magnitude of external costs borne by gilead 
comparison of the years ended december  and the decrease in revenue in is primarily due to a change in estimate of our remaining performance obligations under our collaboration with gilead 
under the proportionate performance method  periodic revenue related to up front license and milestone payments is recognized as the percentage of actual effort expended in that period to total effort expected for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
the most recent project plan agreed upon by the joint research committee resulted in an increase to our total efforts under the collaboration and extended our estimated obligation period under the collaboration to the second half of  resulting in an adjustment to our proportion of completed performance 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a decrease to revenue under the cumulative catch up method to reflect the company s proportionate performance through december  this adjustment reflected our increased remaining performance obligations  which effectively reduced the proportion of our performance obligations that have been completed to date 
this change in estimate caused a non cash reduction in amounts previously recognized as revenue under the collaboration resulting in negative revenue for the fourth quarter of comparison of the years ended december  and the increase in revenue in is primarily due to lower revenue recognized in resulting from a significant change in estimate of our remaining performance obligations as of december   under our collaboration with gilead 
in february  we discontinued further development of ach we also revised 
table of contents our research program with gilead to focus on next generation nsa antagonists 
additionally  our efforts under the collaboration  which were previously estimated to be complete in march  were extended through mid in march  we and gilead agreed to continue to equally share external costs  but effective april   internal full time equivalents would no longer be subject to this cost sharing arrangement

table of contents candidates  to  among other things  obtain regulatory approvals  fund operating losses  and  if deemed appropriate  establish manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities 
we will seek to raise such additional financing through i public or private equity or debt financings  ii collaborative or other arrangements with third parties or iii through other sources of financing 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  our funding resources and requirements may change and will depend upon numerous factors  including but not limited to the outcome of future clinical trials of ach  which will determine our ability to earn future milestone payments from our partner gilead sciences  the costs involved in the preclinical and clinical development  manufacturing and formulation of ach  the costs involved in the preclinical and clinical development of ach and other nsa antagonists  certain portions of which we share with gilead sciences  the outcome of our strategic and development assessment of ach  our ability to enter into corporate collaborations and the terms and success of these collaborations  the costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for our drug candidates  the scope  prioritization and number of programs we pursue  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  enforcing and defending patent and other intellectual property claims  our ability to raise incremental debt or equity capital  our acquisition and development of new technologies and drug candidates  and competing technological and market developments currently unknown to us 
we intend to augment our cash balance in through financing transactions  including the issuance of debt or equity securities  and or further corporate alliances 
no arrangements have been entered into for any future financing and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate levels of additional funding or favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available during  we will be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs  reduce our planned commercialization efforts  obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others on terms unfavorable to us or that may require us to relinquish rights to certain drug candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently  and or pursue merger or acquisition strategies 
additionally  any future equity funding may dilute the ownership of our equity investors 
we have developed a contingency plan which provides for changes in our operations in the event that we are unable to secure additional funding within the next twelve months 
we believe that this plan would reduce its operating expenses and believe that implementation of this contingency plan  if necessary  would permit us to conduct our operations for at least the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following table sets forth a summary of our commitments as of december  payment due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt  including interest operating lease obligations clinical research obligations other research obligations and licenses total the above amounts exclude potential payments that are based on the progress of our drug candidates in development  to be made under our license agreements  as these payments are not yet determinable 
each of the company s debt agreements contains certain subjective acceleration clauses  which upon the occurrence of a material adverse change in the financial condition  business or operations of achillion in the view of the respective lenders  may cause amounts due under the agreements to become immediately due and payable 
as stated previously  we will need additional financing to fund operations which we will seek to raise through public or private equity or debt financings  collaborative or other arrangements with third parties or through other sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that such funding will be available on terms favorable us  if at all 
as such funding cannot be assured  our debt balances have been classified as short term at december  we are not in default with respect to any debt agreements and none of our lenders have accelerated scheduled loan payments

recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we adopted sfas no

on february   the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas no 
this fsp permits a delay in the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after november   for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  at least annually 
we do not believe that adoption of sfas no

in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas no 
sfas no 
permits an entity to elect to report many financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
entities electing the fair value option are required to recognize changes in fair value in earnings and are required to distinguish  on the face of the statement of financial position  the fair value of assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected and similar assets and liabilities measured using another measurement attribute 
the initial adjustment to reflect the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount is accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of initial adoption

sfas no 
r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
certain provisions of this standard will  among other things  impact the determination of acquisition date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination  including contingent consideration  exclude transaction costs from acquisition accounting  and change accounting practices for acquired contingencies  acquisition related restructuring costs  in process research and development  indemnification assets  and tax benefits 
sfas no 
r is effective for business combinations and adjustments to an acquired entity s deferred tax asset and liability balances occurring after december  adoption of sfas no 
r will likely have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations in the event that we enter into a business combination that falls within the scope of this pronouncement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we regularly review our investments and monitor the financial markets 
the recent distress in the financial markets has not had a significant impact on our financial position 
we invest in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds  government sponsored bond obligations and corporate debt securities  with the effective duration of the portfolio less than six months and no security with an effective duration in excess of months  which we believe are subject to limited credit risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to interest rate risk or changes in credit ratings arising from our investments 
capital market risk 
we currently have no product revenues and depend on funds raised through other sources 
one source of funding is through future equity offerings 
our ability to raise funds in this manner depends upon capital market forces affecting our stock price
