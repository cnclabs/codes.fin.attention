hershey trust company  as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school the milton hershey school trust or the trust maintains voting control over the hershey company 
historically  the milton hershey school trust had not taken an active role in setting our policy  nor had it exercised influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board of directors or management 
however  in october  the chairman of the board of the milton hershey school trust issued a statement indicating that the trust continues to be guided by two key principles first  that  in its role as controlling stockholder of the company  it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company and  second  that the long term prosperity of the company requires the board of directors of the company and its management to build on its strong us position by aggressively pursuing strategies for domestic and international growth 
he further stated that the milton hershey school trust had communicated to the company s board that the trust was not satisfied with the company s results and that  as a result  the trust was actively engaged in an ongoing process  the goal of which has been to ensure vigorous company board focus on resolving the company s current business challenges and on implementing new growth strategies 
in that release  the trust board chairman reiterated the trust s longstanding position that the company board  and not the trust board  is solely responsible and accountable for the company s management and performance 
on november  we announced that all of the members of our board of directors had resigned except for richard h 
lenny  who was at that time our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  david j 
west  who was at that time president of the company and currently serves as our president and chief executive officer  and robert f 
cavanaugh  who is also a member of the board of directors of hershey trust company and board of managers governing body of milton hershey school 
in addition  we announced that the milton hershey school trust through stockholder action effected by written consent had amended the by laws of the company to allow the company s stockholders to fix the number of directors to serve on our board of directors and from time to time to increase or decrease such number of directors  expanded the size of our board of directors from directors to directors  and appointed eight new directors  including two who are also members of the board of directors of hershey trust company and board of managers of milton hershey school 
the milton hershey school trust decided to explore a sale of the hershey company in june  but subsequently decided to terminate the sale process in september after terminating the sale process  the trustee of the milton hershey school trust advised the pennsylvania office of attorney general in september that it would not agree to any sale of its controlling interest in the hershey company without approval of the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust following advance notice to the office of attorney general 
subsequently  pennsylvania enacted legislation that requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the milton hershey school trust no longer having voting control of the company 
the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations 
this legislation could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby delay or prevent a change in control of the company 
in december  our board of directors unanimously adopted a stockholder protection rights agreement rights agreement 
the milton hershey school trust supported the rights agreement 
this 
table of contents action was not in response to any specific effort to acquire control of the hershey company 
under the rights agreement  our board of directors declared a dividend of one right right for each outstanding share of common stock and class b stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on december  the rights will at no time have voting power or receive dividends 
the issuance of the rights has no dilutive effect  will not affect reported earnings per share  is not taxable and will not change the manner in which our common stock is traded 
we discuss the rights agreement in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows 
our net income and  consequently  our cash provided from operations are impacted by sales volume  seasonal sales patterns  timing of new product introductions  profit margins and price changes 
sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holiday related sales patterns 
generally  working capital needs peak during the summer months 
we meet these needs primarily by issuing commercial paper 
global capital and credit markets  including the commercial paper markets  have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption 
despite this volatility and disruption  we have continued to have full access to the tier commercial paper market 
we believe that our operating cash flow  together with our unsecured committed revolving credit facility  lines of credit and other available debt financing  will be adequate to meet current operating  investing and financing needs  although there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on commercially acceptable terms

during the three year period  cash used by or provided from changes in other assets and liabilities primarily reflected the impact of business realignment initiatives and the related tax effects  as well as the effect of hedging transactions 
the decrease in income taxes paid in compared with primarily reflected the impact of lower taxable income for cash flows from investing activities our cash flows provided from used by investing activities were as follows for the years ended december  in thousands of dollars capital additions capitalized software additions proceeds from sales of property  plant and equipment business acquisitions proceeds from divestitures net cash used by investing activities capital additions associated with our global supply chain transformation program were approximately million

off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments as of december   our contractual cash obligations by year were as follows payments due by year in thousands of dollars contractual obligations thereafter total unconditional purchase obligations non cancelable operating leases long term debt total obligations in entering into contractual obligations  we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution  conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties 
our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 
we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 
purchase obligations we enter into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials 
these obligations were primarily in the form of forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from third party brokers and dealers 
these contracts minimize the effect of future price fluctuations by fixing the price of part or all of these purchase obligations 
total obligations for each year presented above  consists of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december  the cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods 
we mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent we have entered into commodities futures contracts to hedge our costs for those periods 
increases or decreases in market prices are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts 
this applies to the extent that we have hedged the unpriced contracts as of december  and in future periods by entering into commodities futures contracts 
taking delivery of and making payments for the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies our obligations under the forward purchase contracts 
for each of the three years in the period ended december   we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities 

table of contents asset retirement obligations our company has a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities 
our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations 
current regulations require that we handle or dispose of this type of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished 
we believe we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities 
we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and  therefore  sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique 
we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of asbestos 
as of december   certain real estate associated with the closure of facilities under the global supply chain transformation program is being held for sale 
we are not aware of any significant obligations related to the environmental remediation of these facilities which has not been reflected in our current estimates 
income tax obligations we base our deferred income taxes  accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income  statutory tax rates  the legal structure of our company and interpretation of tax laws 
we are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
from time to time  these audits result in assessments of additional tax 
we maintain reserves for such assessments 
we adjust the reserves  from time to time  based upon changing facts and circumstances  such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established 
assessments of additional tax require cash payments 
we are not aware of any significant income tax assessments 
the amount of tax obligations is not included in the table of contractual cash obligations by year on page because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes 
accounting policies and market risks associated with derivative instruments we use certain derivative instruments  from time to time  including interest rate swaps  foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options  and commodities futures and options contracts  to manage interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures  respectively 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange forward contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures 
these derivative instruments do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
we enter into commodities futures and options contracts for varying periods 
these futures and options contracts are intended to be  and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases  energy requirements and transportation costs 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 
in entering into these contracts  we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution  conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties 
we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 
accounting under statement of financial accounting standards no 
we account for derivative instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas no 

sfas no 
provides that we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument as a component of other comprehensive income 
we reclassify the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument resulting from hedge ineffectiveness  if any  must be recognized currently in earnings 

table of contents fair value hedges pertain to derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge of exposures to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet 
for fair value hedges  we reflect the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item 
the effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value 
as of december   we designated and accounted for all derivative instruments  including foreign exchange forward contracts and commodities futures contracts  as cash flow hedges 
additional information regarding accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the information below summarizes our market risks associated with long term debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of december  note  note and note to the consolidated financial statements provide additional information 
long term debt the table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for long term debt  including the current portion  as of december  we determined the fair value of long term debt based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues 
maturity date thereafter total fair value in thousands of dollars except for rates long term debt interest rate we calculated the interest rates on variable rate obligations using the rates in effect as of december  interest rate swaps in order to minimize financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure  from time to time  we enter into interest rate swap agreements 
in december  we entered into forward swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to million of term financing to be executed during in february  we terminated a forward swap agreement hedging the anticipated execution of million of term financing because the transaction was no longer expected to occur by the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter 
we recorded a gain of million in the first quarter of as a result of the discontinuance of this cash flow hedge 
in august  a forward swap agreement hedging the anticipated issuance of million of year notes matured resulting in cash receipts of million 
the million gain on the swap will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the million of notes due september  as of december  and we were not a party to any interest rate swap agreements 
foreign exchange forward contracts we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
these transactions are primarily purchase commitments or forecasted purchases of equipment  raw materials and finished goods 
we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside the united states 
these contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements 
we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from to months 

table of contents foreign exchange forward contracts are effective as hedges of identifiable  foreign currency commitments 
we designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedging derivatives 
the fair value of these contracts is classified as either an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
we record gains and losses on these contracts as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
a summary of foreign exchange forward contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows december  contract amount primary currencies contract amount primary currencies in millions of dollars foreign exchange forward contracts to purchase foreign currencies euros swiss francs mexican pesos british pounds australian dollars euros foreign exchange forward contracts to sell foreign currencies canadian dollars australian dollars canadian dollars brazilian reais mexican pesos we define the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as the amount of the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period 
we estimate the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms  adjusted where necessary for maturity differences 
a summary of the fair value and market risk associated with foreign exchange forward contracts is as follows december  in millions of dollars fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts  net asset liability potential net loss in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts of ten percent resulting from a hypothetical near term adverse change in market rates our risk related to foreign exchange forward contracts is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 
commodities price risk management and futures contracts our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products  sugar  dairy products  peanuts and almonds 
the cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors 
these factors include the effect of weather on crop yield  imbalances between supply and demand  currency exchange rates  political unrest in producing countries  and speculative influences 

table of contents we use futures and options contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products  sugar  corn sweeteners  natural gas  fuel oil and certain dairy products primarily to provide favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing our raw material and energy requirements 
we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for to months 
however  the dairy futures markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities markets and  therefore  there are limited opportunities to hedge our costs by taking forward positions to extend coverage beyond three to six months 
we use fuel oil futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs 
our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs  but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases 
during  cocoa prices traded in a range between 
and per pound  based on the prices of intercontinentalexchange futures contracts 
cocoa futures traded at prices which were near year highs by mid year primarily reflecting speculative commodity fund trading activity 
during the fourth quarter of  a reduction in anticipated demand associated with deteriorating economic conditions in addition to strengthening of the us dollar in relation to other relevant foreign currencies resulted in the significant liquidation of cocoa futures positions by speculative commodity funds 
this resulted in a substantial decrease in cocoa futures market prices near the end of the year 
during  dairy prices have come down from unprecedented highs set in  starting the year at nearly 
per pound and dropping to 
per pound on a class ii fluid milk basis 
prices have weakened in response to strong production of milk and dairy products and slowing demand worldwide 
we account for commodities futures contracts in accordance with sfas no 
we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the intercontinentalexchange or various other exchanges 
these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses 
we report these cash transfers as a component of other comprehensive income 
the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials  energy requirements and transportation costs 
futures held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases 
sensitivity analysis the following sensitivity analysis reflects our market risk to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent  based on our net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year 
our net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts we hold over or under the amount of futures contracts we need to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities 
inventories  priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not yet under contract were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations 
we define a loss  for purposes of determining market risk  as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement 
the fair values of net commodity positions reflect quoted market prices or estimated future prices  including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period 
for the years ended december  fair value market risk hypothetical change fair value market risk hypothetical change in millions of dollars highest long position lowest long position average position long 
table of contents the decrease in fair values from to primarily reflected a decrease in net commodity positions  which more than offset the impact of higher prices in the negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures that we held at certain points in time during the years 
sensitivity analysis disclosures represent forward looking statements which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presently anticipated or projected 
factors that could affect the sensitivity analysis disclosures include significant increases or decreases in market prices reflecting fluctuations attributable to the effect of weather on crop yield  imbalances between supply and demand  currency exchange rates  political unrest in producing countries  speculative influences  and changes in our hedging strategies 
use of estimates and other critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in various instances  gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following accounts receivable trade accrued liabilities pension and other post retirement benefits plans goodwill and other intangible assets commodities futures contracts management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions 
for a discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable trade in the normal course of business  we extend credit to customers that satisfy pre defined credit criteria based upon the results of our recurring financial account reviews and our evaluation of the current and projected economic conditions 
our primary concentration of credit risk is associated with mclane company  inc  one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores  drug stores  wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers 
mclane company  inc accounted for approximately of our total accounts receivable as of december  as of december   no other customer accounted for more than of our total accounts receivable 
we believe that we have little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of our customer base 

table of contents accounts receivable trade  as shown on the consolidated balance sheets  were net of allowances and anticipated discounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the following aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of collectibility based on historical trends  and evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions 
we monitor the collectibility of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis by analyzing aged accounts receivable  assessing the credit worthiness of our customers and evaluating the impact of reasonably likely changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks 
estimates with regard to the collectibility of accounts receivable are reasonably likely to change in the future 
information on our accounts receivable trade  related expenses and assumptions is as follows for the three year period in millions of dollars  except percents average expense for potential uncollectible accounts average write offs of uncollectible accounts allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable we recognize the provision for uncollectible accounts as selling  marketing and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income 
if we made reasonably possible near term changes in the most material assumptions regarding collectibility of accounts receivable  our annual provision could change within the following range a reduction in expense of approximately million  and an increase in expense of approximately million 
changes in estimates for future uncollectible accounts receivable would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
accrued liabilities accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products 
liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs we recognize the costs of marketing promotion programs as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition 
information on our promotional costs and assumptions is as follows for the years ended december  in millions of dollars promotional costs we determine the amount of the accrued liability by analysis of programs offered  historical trends  expectations regarding customer and consumer participation  sales and payment trends  and 
table of contents experience with payment patterns associated with similar  previously offered programs 
the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation  particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products 
reasonably possible near term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the cost of promotional programs could result in changes within the following range a reduction in costs of approximately million an increase in costs of approximately million changes in these assumptions would affect net sales and income before income taxes 
over the three year period ended december   actual promotion costs have not deviated from the estimated amounts by more than 
changes in estimates related to the cost of promotional programs would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
liabilities associated with potentially unsaleable products at the time of sale  we estimate a cost for the possibility that products will become aged or unsaleable in the future 
the estimated cost is included as a reduction to net sales 
a related accrued liability is determined using statistical analysis that incorporates historical sales trends  seasonal timing and sales patterns  and product movement at retail 
estimates for costs associated with unsaleable products may change as a result of inventory levels in the distribution channel  current economic trends  changes in consumer demand  the introduction of new products and changes in trends of seasonal sales in response to promotional programs 
over the three year period ended december   costs associated with aged or unsaleable products have amounted to approximately of gross sales 
reasonably possible near term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the estimates of such costs would have increased or decreased net sales and income before income taxes in a range from 
million to million 
over the three year period ended december   actual costs have not deviated from our estimates by more than approximately 
reasonably possible near term changes in the estimates of costs associated with unsaleable products would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
pension and other post retirement benefit plans overview we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans 
the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees 
these are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees hired prior to january  we monitor legislative and regulatory developments regarding cash balance plans  as well as recent court cases  for any impact on our plans 
we also sponsor two primary post retirement benefit plans 
the health care plan is contributory  with participants contributions adjusted annually  and the life insurance plan is non contributory 
we fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of and federal income tax laws 
beginning january   we complied with the 
table of contents funding requirements of the pension protection act of we fund non domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans 
we broadly diversify our pension plan assets  consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities 
short term and long term liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations 
these calculations consider payroll and employee data  including age and years of service  along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements 
we take into consideration long term projections with regard to economic conditions  including interest rates  return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels 
with regard to liabilities associated with post retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance  we take into consideration the long term annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits 
in compliance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  we review the discount rate assumptions and may revise them annually 
the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption asset return assumption for funded plans is by its nature of a longer duration and revised only when long term asset return projections demonstrate that need 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas no 

sfas no 
requires an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more single employer defined benefit plans to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation in its statement of financial position 
for a pension plan  the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation  for any other post retirement benefit plan  such as a retiree health care plan  the benefit obligation is the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation 
recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 
measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position 
disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses  prior service costs or credits  and transition asset or obligation 
we adopted the recognition and related disclosure provisions of sfas no 
as of december  pension plans our pension plan costs and related assumptions were as follows for the years ended december  in millions of dollars net periodic pension benefit income costs assumptions average discount rate assumptions net periodic benefit cost calculation average discount rate assumptions benefit obligation calculation asset return assumptions 
table of contents net periodic pension benefit costs we recorded net periodic pension benefit income in primarily due to the modifications announced in october which reduced future benefits under the hershey company retirement plan  the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees and the supplemental executive retirement plan and the impact of a higher discount rate assumption as of december  we expect to incur periodic pension benefit costs in of approximately million compared with income of approximately million in  principally as a result of the significant decline in the value of pension plan assets during reflecting the unprecedented volatility and deterioration in financial market and economic conditions 
actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans obligations 
we only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains losses in excess of of a respective plan s projected benefit obligation  or the fair market value of assets  if greater 
the estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense for is million 
the recognized net actuarial gain component of net periodic pension benefit income was 
million 
projections beyond are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets 
average discount rate assumption net periodic benefit income costs the discount rate represents the estimated rate at which we could effectively settle our pension benefit obligations 
in order to estimate this rate for and  a single effective rate of discount was determined by our actuaries after discounting the pension obligation s cash flows using the spot rate of matching duration from the citigroup pension discount curve 
the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit income cost a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have decreased net periodic pension benefit income by million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have increased net periodic pension benefit income by million 
average discount rate assumption benefit obligations the discount rate assumption to be used in calculating the amount of benefit obligations is determined in the same manner as the average discount rate assumption used to calculate net periodic benefit income cost as described above 
we increased our discount rate assumption due to the increasing interest rate environment consistent with the duration of our pension plan liabilities 
the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect the amount of benefit obligations a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the december  pension benefits obligations by million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the december  pension benefits obligations by million 

table of contents asset return assumptions we based the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit income costs on the fair market value of pension plan assets 
to determine the expected return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets 
the historical geometric average return over the years prior to december  was approximately 
the actual return on assets was as follows for the years ended december  actual loss return on assets the use of a different asset return assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit income cost a one percentage point decrease in the asset return assumption would have decreased net periodic pension benefit income by million 
a one percentage point increase in the asset return assumption would have increased net periodic pension benefit income by million 
our asset investment policies specify ranges of asset allocation percentages for each asset class 
the ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows asset class allocation range equity securities debt securities cash and certain other investments as of december   actual allocations were within the specified ranges 
we expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes 
as of december   the benefit plan fixed income assets were invested primarily in conventional instruments benchmarked to the barclays capital us aggregate bond index and direct exposure to highly volatile  risky sectors  such as sub prime mortgages  was minimal 
for and  minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material 
however  we made contributions of million in and million in to improve the funded status of our qualified plans and for the payment of benefits under our non qualified pension plans 
these contributions were fully tax deductible 
a one percentage point change in the funding discount rate would not have changed the minimum funding requirements significantly for the domestic plans 
for  there are no significant minimum funding requirements for our pension plans 
post retirement benefit plans other post retirement benefit plan costs and related assumptions were as follows for the years ended december  in millions of dollars net periodic other post retirement benefit cost assumptions average discount rate assumption 
table of contents the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic other post retirement benefit cost a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have decreased net periodic other post retirement benefit cost by 
million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have increased net periodic other post retirement benefit cost by million 
other post retirement benefit obligations and assumptions were as follows december  in millions of dollars other post retirement benefit obligation assumptions benefit obligations discount rate assumption a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the december  other post retirement benefits obligations by million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the december  other post retirement benefits obligations by million 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard classifies intangible assets into three categories intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization  and goodwill 
for intangible assets with definite lives  the standard requires impairment testing if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill  the standard requires impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired 
we use a two step process to evaluate goodwill for impairment 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record 
in the second step  we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets 
we compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference 
the assumptions we used to estimate fair value are based on the past performance of each reporting unit and reflect the projections and assumptions that we use in current operating plans 
we also consider assumptions that market participants may use 
such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 
our other intangible assets consist primarily of customer related intangible assets  patents and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions 
we amortize customer related intangible assets and patents over their estimated useful lives 
the useful lives of trademarks were determined to be indefinite and  therefore  we do not amortize them 
we evaluate our trademarks for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value 
the fair value of trademarks is calculated using a relief from royalty payments methodology 
this approach involves two steps 
in the first step  we estimate reasonable royalty rates for each 
table of contents trademark 
in the second step  we apply these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discount the resulting cash flows to determine fair value 
this fair value is then compared with the carrying value of each trademark 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount  we record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
the estimates of future cash flows are generally based on past performance of the brands and reflect net sales projections and assumptions for the brands that we use in current operating plans 
we also consider assumptions that market participants may use 
such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 
the company performs annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist 
due to reduced expectations for future sales and cash flows compared with the valuations at the acquisition dates  we determined that the carrying amounts of certain trademarks  primarily the mauna loa brand  exceeded their estimated fair value and recorded total non cash impairment charges of million in december as a result of reduced expectations for future cash flows resulting from lower expected profitability  we determined that the carrying amount of our wholly owned subsidiary  hershey do brasil  exceeded its fair value and recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in december there was no tax benefit associated with these charges 
we discuss the impairment testing results in more detail in note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
we determined that none of our goodwill or other intangible assets  with the exception of the aforementioned trademarks and brazil goodwill  were impaired as of december  and based on our annual impairment evaluation 
commodities futures and options contracts we use futures and options contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products and other commodities primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases  provide visibility to future costs and take advantage of market fluctuations 
accounting for commodities futures and options contracts is in accordance with sfas no 
additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments is contained in note  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
our gains losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were as follows for the years ended december  in millions of dollars net after tax gains on cash flow hedging derivatives reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive loss to income hedge ineffectiveness losses gains recognized in cost of sales  before tax we reflected reclassification adjustments related to gains or losses on commodities futures and options contracts in cost of sales 
no gains or losses on commodities futures and options contracts resulted because we discontinued a hedge due to the probability that the forecasted hedged transaction would not occur 
we recognized no components of gains or losses on commodities futures and options contracts in income due to excluding such components from the hedge effectiveness assessment 
the amount of net losses on cash flow hedging derivatives  including foreign exchange forward contracts and commodities futures and options contracts  expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months was approximately million after tax as of december  this amount is primarily associated with commodities futures contracts 

table of contents return measures we believe that two important measures of profitability are operating return on average stockholders equity and operating return on average invested capital 
these operating return measures calculated in accordance with gaap are presented on the six year consolidated financial summary on page with the directly comparable non gaap operating return measures 
the non gaap operating return measures are calculated using non gaap income excluding items affecting comparability 
a reconciliation of net income presented in accordance with gaap to non gaap income excluding items affecting comparability is provided on pages and  along with the reasons why we believe that the use of non gaap income in these calculations provides useful information to investors 
operating return on average stockholders equity operating return on average stockholders equity is calculated by dividing net income by the average of beginning and ending stockholders equity 
to calculate non gaap operating return on average stockholders equity  we define non gaap income as net income adjusted to exclude certain items 
these items include the following after tax effect of the business realignment and impairment charges in    and adjustment to income tax contingency reserves which reduced the provision for income taxes in after tax gain on the sale of a group of our gum brands in our operating return on average stockholders equity  gaap basis  was in our non gaap operating return on average stockholders equity was in the increase in operating return on average stockholders equity in compared with was principally due to a reduction in equity related to reduced pension plan assets and the impact of cumulative translation adjustments 
over the last six years  our non gaap operating return on stockholders equity has ranged from in to in operating return on average invested capital operating return on average invested capital is calculated by dividing earnings by average invested capital 
average invested capital consists of the annual average of the beginning and ending balances of long term debt  deferred income taxes and stockholders equity 
for the calculation of operating return on average invested capital  gaap basis  earnings is defined as net income adjusted to add back the after tax effect of interest on long term debt 
for the calculation of the non gaap operating return measure  we define earnings as net income adjusted to add back the after tax effect of interest on long term debt excluding the following after tax effect of the business realignment and impairment charges in    and adjustment to income tax contingency reserves on the provision for income taxes in after tax gain on the sale of a group of our gum brands in our operating return on average invested capital  gaap basis  was in our non gaap operating return on average invested capital was in over the last six years  our non gaap operating return on average invested capital has ranged from in to in and 
table of contents outlook the outlook section contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on current expectations 
actual results may differ materially 
refer to risk factors beginning on page for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals 
during  we announced a new consumer driven business model with a comprehensive approach intended to deliver sustainable growth over the coming years 
our financial targets include long term consolidated net sales growth in the three to five percent range and increases in earnings per share diluted  excluding items affecting comparability  at an annual rate of six to eight percent 
items affecting comparability include business realignment and impairment charges and credits  gains or losses on the sale of certain businesses  and certain other items 
our net sales growth will primarily leverage our core portfolio of brands in the united states 
we expect to improve our price value equation through package and product upgrades and merchandising innovation resulting in increased price realization 
we also expect growth from our international businesses primarily in faster growing emerging markets 
for  we expect net sales growth of two to three percent from our pricing actions and core brand sales growth 
we expect unit sales volume to decline in the united states due to the elasticity effects of price increases implemented during which will result in higher everyday and promoted prices for consumers 
the impact of the declines in unit sales volume is expected to be more than offset by price realization 
we expect growth in net sales for our international business at rates greater than in the united states  offset somewhat by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 
considering the significant increases in raw material prices and other input costs and the extreme volatility in market prices  we expect substantial cost increases in while commodity spot prices have moderated somewhat  we expect costs for our key inputs to remain volatile and above historical averages on a spot basis 
we now expect our commodity cost basket to increase by approximately million in compared with the financial market and credit crisis have not had a material affect on our business operations or liquidity to date 
however  the extraordinary decline in the financial markets in significantly reduced the fair value of our pension plan assets which is expected to result in an increase in pension expense of approximately million 
despite these increases we plan to continue to invest in our core brands in the us and key international markets to build on our momentum 
specifically  advertising expense is expected to increase by million to million in these cost increases will be more than offset by higher net pricing  savings from the global supply chain transformation program and on going operating productivity improvement 
earnings per share diluted  excluding items affecting comparability  is expected to increase in  however  due to the significant commodity and pension cost increases  higher levels of core brand investment spending and current macroeconomic conditions  we expect growth to be at a rate below our long term objective of six to eight percent 
for  we expect total pre tax business realignment and impairment charges for our global supply chain transformation program  including the increase in the scope of the program  to be in the range of million to million  excluding possible increases in pension settlement charges discussed below 
total charges associated with our business realignment initiatives in are expected to reduce earnings per share diluted by to

the company normally amortizes actuarial gains and losses over a period of about years 
the global supply chain transformation program charges recorded in and in have included pension settlement charges of approximately million as employees leaving the company under the program have been withdrawing lump sums from the defined benefit pension plans 
these charges are included in the current global supply chain transformation program estimates of million to million 
in addition to the settlement charges reflected above  additional sfas no 
pension settlement charges of up to million may be incurred depending on decisions of impacted hourly employees to withdraw funds during and the amount of the potential charges has increased significantly as a result of the recent declines in the financial markets 
the likely range of possible additional charges for is zero to million 
there would be no charge if withdrawals by hourly employees are below the sfas no 
settlement threshold level and million  based on current market conditions  if they are above the threshold level
