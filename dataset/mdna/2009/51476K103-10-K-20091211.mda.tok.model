recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance that amends the accounting for business combinations  and the accounting and reporting for a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary 
the amended guidance aims to improve  simplify  and converge internationally the accounting for and reporting of business combinations and noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
the revised provisions are effective  and should be applied prospectively  for the company beginning in fiscal the company will apply the amended guidance for any business combinations beginning in fiscal  including the first quarter acquisitions of gps  gdm and landauer persondosimetri ab 
the company does not expect the amended guidance for accounting and reporting for noncontrolling interests to have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
in september  the fasb approved the issuance of new guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables and arrangements that include software elements 
by providing another alternative for determining the selling price of deliverables  the new guidance will allow companies to allocate arrangement consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements in a manner that better reflects the transaction s economics and will often result in earlier revenue recognition 
in addition  the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration is no longer permitted under the new guidance 
the new guidance for arrangements that include software elements removes non software components of tangible products and certain software components of tangible products from the scope of existing software revenue guidance  resulting in the recognition of revenue similar to that for other tangible products 
the new guidance requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  the guidance may be applied either prospectively from the beginning of the fiscal year for new or materially modified arrangements or retrospectively 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance to its financial position  results of operations and financial disclosures 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements effective october   the company adopted the fasb authoritative guidance for the accounting for the deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of collateral assignment split dollar life insurance arrangements 
the guidance requires that an employer recognize a liability for the postretirement benefit related to a collateral assignment split dollar life insurance arrangement 
as a result of the implementation of the guidance  the company recognized a decrease of in its long term asset recorded for its collateral assignment split dollar life insurance arrangement and recorded a liability of for premiums payable under the arrangement 
the october  balance of retained earnings was reduced by the company s liability for this arrangement is expected to be settled in fiscal effective october   the company adopted the fasb standards which define fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand disclosures about fair value measurements 
the guidance applies under other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements 
the adoption of these standards did not impact the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended september  effective october   the company adopted the fasb authoritative guidance which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis  with unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the new guidance also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities 
the company did not elect the fair value option and  therefore  the adoption of the guidance did not impact the company s financial position  results of operations and financial disclosures for the year ended september  effective june   the company adopted the new general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the standards require disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date 
the adoption of the standards did not impact the consolidated financial statements for the year ended september  effective for the company s financial statements issued for the fiscal year ending september   the company adopted the fasb accounting standards codification 
the fasb established the codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative us gaap for sec registrants 
the codification supersedes all prior accounting standard documents  and all other nongrandfathered non sec accounting literature not included in the codification became nonauthoritative 
the codification does not change or alter existing us gaap and  therefore  did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that management make assumptions and estimates that affect the results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements as well as related disclosures 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
below are the critical accounting policies which have been applied in the preparation of the company s financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition and deferred contract revenue the majority of the services provided by the company to its customers is of a subscription nature and is continuous 
the company views its business as services provided to customers over a period of time and the wear period is the period over which those services are provided 
badge production  wearing of badges  badge analysis  and report preparation are integral to the benefit that the company provides to its customers 
these services are provided to customers on an agreed upon recurring basis monthly  bi monthly or quarterly that the customer chooses for the wear period 
revenue is recognized on a straight line basis  adjusted for changes in pricing and volume  over the wear period as the service is continuous and no other discernible pattern of recognition is evident 
revenues are recognized over the periods in which the customers wear the badges irrespective of whether invoiced in advance or in arrears 
the amounts recorded as deferred contract revenue in the consolidated balance sheets represent customer deposits invoiced in advance during the preceding twelve months for services rendered over the succeeding twelve months  and are net of services rendered through the respective consolidated balance sheet date 
such advance billings amounted to  and  respectively  as of september  and september  property  plant equipment and other assets maintenance and repairs are charged to expense  and renewals and betterments are capitalized 
plant and equipment and other assets  primarily dosimetry badges  are recorded at cost and are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  which are primarily years for buildings  three to eight years for equipment  and thirty months to five years for other assets 
landauer assesses the carrying value and the remaining useful lives of its property  plant  equipment  and other assets when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the estimated useful life may no longer be appropriate 
factors that could trigger this review include competitive conditions  government regulations and technological changes 
landauer capitalizes  as a component of equipment  costs of software which is acquired  internally developed  or modified solely to meet the company s internal needs 
in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance  internal and external costs incurred to develop internal use computer software during the application development stage are capitalized 
costs incurred during the preliminary project stage as well as training costs and maintenance costs during the postimplementation operation stage are expensed 
capitalized costs amounted to   and  respectively  for fiscal years  and in fiscal year  approximately  of the capitalized software costs was related to the company s initiative to re engineer various business processes and replace components of its information technology systems that support customer relationship management and the order to cash cycle 
the new software is replacing certain legacy assets that were either subject to immediate impairment or retirement once the full system implementation has been completed 
in fiscal  the remainder of the costs was related to legacy assets remaining in use by the company 
in fiscal years and  some of the legacy assets were included in the evaluation for immediate impairment or retirement 
information regarding these costs is contained under the footnote impairment and accelerated depreciation charges on page of this annual report on form k 
goodwill and other intangible assets landauer s intangible assets include purchased customer lists  licenses  patents  trademarks  tradenames and goodwill 
purchased customer lists are recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
patents and licenses are also recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  which range from to years 
the company acquired goodwill primarily from its acquisitions of landauer europe and sapra landauer as well as other smaller investments 
goodwill as well as trademarks and tradenames have indefinite lives 
fasb authoritative guidance requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives be reviewed periodically for impairment 
the impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets that are not being amortized  generally  is performed annually and is based on fair values 
the company s methodology for testing goodwill for impairment includes an initial review of potential impairment triggering events and tests of fair market value 
should a triggering event be identified  the company performs a financial analysis of future undiscounted cash flows projections by investment 
triggering events include  but are not limited to  a current period operating or cash flow loss  a product  technology  or service introduced by a competitor  or a loss of key personnel 
as a result of its testing and review for impairment  the company determined that no impairment was required to be recognized as of september  information regarding the value of goodwill and other intangible assets is presented under the footnote goodwill and other intangible assets on page of this annual report on form k 
income taxes the company estimates the income tax provision for income taxes that are currently payable  and records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences in tax consequences between the financial statements and tax returns 
temporary differences result from  among other events  revenues  expenses  gains  or losses that are included in taxable income of an earlier or later year than the year in which they are recognized in financial income 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
to the extent that deferred tax assets will not likely be recovered from future taxable income  a valuation allowance is established against such deferred tax assets 
management exercises significant judgment in the valuation of its current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company recognizes the financial statement effects of its tax positions in its current and deferred tax assets and liabilities when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
management considers  among other factors  the company s current and past performance  the market environment in which the company operates  and tax planning strategies 
further  the company provides for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and local tax authorities 
the company assesses and updates its tax positions when significant changes in circumstances  which would cause a change in judgment about the likelihood of realizing the deferred items  occur 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
further information regarding the company s income taxes is contained under the footnote income taxes on page of this annual report on form k 
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans the pension expenses and benefit obligations recorded for the company s defined benefit plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  interest costs  expected compensation increases  benefits earned  mortality rates  and other factors 
management reviews the plan assumptions on an annual basis to ensure that the most current  relevant information is considered 
if actual results vary considerably from those that are expected or if future changes are made to these assumptions  the amounts recognized for these plans could change significantly 
as a result of plan amendments during fiscal which led to plan curtailments  the amended plans required remeasurement of benefit obligations using prevailing rates at that time 
for the period from october   to january   the discount rate used for the amended plans was 
for the period february   to september   the discount rate used for the amended plans was 
all other assumptions determined as of october  remained appropriate for the amended plans through the entire fiscal year 
including the impact of the changes in discount rates  the weighted average assumed discount rate used to determine the fiscal plan expenses was for pension benefits and for other benefits compared to for all benefits in fiscal for fiscal expense  the expected long term rate of return of plan assets was  unchanged from fiscal in establishing the rate  management considered the historical rates of return and the current and planned asset classes of the plan investment portfolio 
in determining the rate of compensation increase of for fiscal and  management considered historical company increases  market expectations and expected future company increases 
the weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at september  were a discount rate of compared to the fiscal rate of  adjusted to reflect the single rate that  when applied to the projected benefit disbursements from the plan  would result in the same discounted value as the array of rates that make up the citigroup pension discount curve as of september   and a rate of compensation increase of  unchanged from fiscal the company recognizes on its balance sheet the amount by which the projected benefit obligations of its defined benefit plans exceed the fair value of plan assets 
subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans as a result of future transactions and events  amortization of previously unrecognized costs  and changes to actuarial assumptions are recognized as an asset or a liability and amortized as components of net periodic pension cost or accumulated other comprehensive income 
an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management s control could have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
information regarding these plans is contained under the footnote employee benefit plans on page of this annual report on form k 
stock based compensation the company measures and recognizes compensation cost at fair value for all stock based awards  net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards 
the company granted stock options in years prior to fiscal the fair values of options were estimated using a black scholes option pricing model 
in addition to stock options  key employees and or non employee directors are eligible to receive performance shares and restricted stock 
the fair value of performance shares and restricted stock granted under the company s long term incentive plan was based on the average of the company s high and low stock prices on the date of grant 
upon the adoption of the company s incentive compensation plan in february  the fair value of performance shares and restricted stock granted under the new plan is based on the company s closing stock price on the grant date 
the terms of performance share awards allow the recipients of such awards to earn a variable number of shares based on the achievement of the performance goals specified in the awards 
stock based compensation expense associated with performance share awards is recognized based on management s best estimates of the achievement of the performance goals specified in such awards and the resulting number of shares that are expected to be earned 
the company evaluates on a quarterly basis the progress towards achieving the performance criteria 
the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated number of performance share awards expected to be earned is recognized as compensation cost or as a reduction of cost in the period of the revised estimate 
compensation expense for restricted stock is recognized ratably over the vesting period 
forfeitures of awards are estimated at the time of grant and stock based compensation cost is recognized only for those awards expected to vest 
the company uses historical experience to estimate projected forfeitures 
the company recognizes the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the forfeiture rate  or actual forfeitures  as compensation cost or as a reduction of cost in the period of the revision 
if revisions are made to management s assumptions and estimates or if actual results vary considerably from those that are expected  stock based compensation expense could change significantly  impacting the company s results of operations or financial condition
