ebitda should not be considered a substitute for net income  income from operations or cash flows provided by or used in operations  as determined in accordance with gaap 
ebitda is a key measure of our operating performance used by management to focus on consolidated operating performance exclusive of income and expense that relate to the financing and capitalization of the business 
we define ebitda as income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  interest expense and depreciation and amortization 
we use ebitda to assess our consolidated financial 
table of contents and operating performance  and we believe this non measure  is helpful in identifying trends in our performance 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieve optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
ebitda provides us with a measure of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges on our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results

overview we are a global company that acquires  leases and sells high utility commercial jet aircraft to passenger and cargo airlines throughout the world 
high utility aircraft are generally modern  operationally efficient jets with a large operator base and long useful lives 
as of december   our aircraft portfolio consisted of aircraft that were leased to lessees located in countries  and managed through our offices in the united states  ireland and singapore 
typically  our aircraft are subject to net operating leases whereby the lessee is generally responsible for maintaining the aircraft and paying operational  maintenance and insurance costs  although  in a majority of cases  we are obligated to pay a portion of specified maintenance or modification costs 
from time to time  we also make investments in other aviation assets  including debt investments secured by commercial jet aircraft 
our revenues and income from continuing operations for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively and for the fourth quarter were million and million  respectively 
segments historically  we reported separate segment information for the operations of our aircraft leasing and debt investments segments 
beginning in the first quarter of  in conjunction with the sale of two of our debt investments as described below  our chief operating decision maker  who is the company s chief executive officer  began reviewing and assessing the operating performance of our business on a consolidated basis as the sale caused the operational results and asset levels of our remaining debt investments to be immaterial to our business and operations 
as a result  we now operate in a single segment 
in february  we sold two of our debt investments for million  plus accrued interest 
we repaid the outstanding balance of million  plus accrued interest  under the related repurchase agreement 
additionally  we terminated the related interest rate swap  with notional amounts of million at december  and million as of the termination date  related to the repurchase agreement and paid breakage fees and accrued interest of approximately million  resulting in a loss of million  which is included in interest expense on the consolidated statement of income 
the reduction in debt investments was done in order to deploy our capital more efficiently and to reduce short term repurchase agreement borrowings and interest rate exposure on our hedged repurchase agreements related to these debt investments 

table of contents revenues revenues are comprised primarily of operating lease rentals on flight equipment held for lease 
in addition  we recognize revenue from retained maintenance payments related to lease expirations 
typically  our aircraft are subject to net operating leases whereby the lessee pays rentals and is generally responsible for maintaining the aircraft and paying operational  maintenance and insurance costs  although in a majority of cases we are obligated to pay a portion of specified maintenance or modification costs 
the amount of rent we receive depends on various factors  including the type  size and age of the aircraft in our portfolio 
lease payments are typically denominated in us dollars 
lease rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
our aircraft lease agreements generally provide for the periodic payment of a fixed amount of rent over the life of the lease 
however  the amount of rent we receive may vary due to several factors  including the credit worthiness of our lessees and the occurrence of delinquencies and defaults 
our lease rental revenues are also affected by the extent to which aircraft are off lease and our ability to remarket aircraft that are nearing the end of their leases in order to minimize their off lease time 
our success in re leasing aircraft is affected by market conditions relating to our aircraft and by general industry trends 
an increase in the percentage of off lease aircraft or a reduction in lease rates upon remarketing would negatively impact our revenues 
operating expenses operating expenses are comprised of depreciation of flight equipment held for lease  interest expense  selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  and other expenses 
since our operating lease terms generally require the lessee to pay for operating  maintenance and insurance costs  our portion of other expenses relating to aircraft reflected in our statement of income has been nominal 
income tax provision we have obtained an assurance from the minister of finance of bermuda under the exempted undertakings tax protection act that  in the event that any legislation is enacted in bermuda imposing any tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  such tax shall not  until march   be applicable to us or to any of our operations or to our shares  debentures or other obligations except insofar as such tax applies to persons ordinarily resident in bermuda or to any taxes payable by us in respect of real property owned or leased by us in bermuda 
consequently  the provision for income taxes recorded relates to income earned by certain subsidiaries of the company which are located in  or earn income in  jurisdictions that impose income taxes  primarily ireland and the united states 
all of our aircraft owning subsidiaries that are recognized as corporations for us tax purposes are us corporations 
these non us subsidiaries generally earn income from sources outside the united states and typically are not subject to us federal  state or local income taxes unless they operate within the us  in which case they may be subject to federal  state and local income taxes 
we also have a u 
s based subsidiary which provides management services to our non us subsidiaries and is subject to non us federal  state and local income taxes 
history aircastle limited  formerly aircastle investment limited  is a bermuda exempted company that was incorporated on october  by fortress investment group llc and certain of its affiliates 
acquisitions and dispositions on january   we entered into the gaif acquisition agreement pursuant to which we acquired aircraft for an aggregate base purchase price of approximately billion  subject to 
table of contents certain agreed upon adjustments 
we acquired of the aircraft in related to this transaction and the remaining four aircraft were acquired during the first half of on june   we entered into the airbus a agreement under which we agreed to acquire from airbus fifteen new a aircraft  or the new a aircraft as reduced to twelve aircraft as described below 
pre delivery payments for each aircraft are payable to airbus and are refundable to us only in limited circumstances 
we agreed to separate arrangements with rolls royce plc  or rolls royce  and pratt whitney  or p w  pursuant to which we committed to acquire aircraft engines for the new a aircraft 
we agreed to acquire six shipsets of trent b engines from rolls royce and were granted options to acquire an additional four shipsets 
we also committed to acquire five shipsets of pw engines from p w  and were granted options to acquire an additional five shipsets 
each shipset consists of two engines 
in july  we amended the airbus a agreement  reducing the number of new a aircraft to be acquired from fifteen to twelve and changing the airbus a agreement so that we receive a mix of freighter and passenger aircraft 
as a result  seven of the new a aircraft are scheduled to be delivered as freighters  including the first three positions  and five of the new a aircraft will be manufactured in passenger configuration 
as of december   we had paid million in airbus deposits and pre delivery payments and recorded million in capitalized interest 
pre delivery payments scheduled for amount to million 
under certain circumstances  we have the right to change the delivery positions to alternative a aircraft models 
in february  we amended the airbus a agreement to defer the scheduled delivery of an aircraft from the fourth quarter of to the first half of three of the new a aircraft are scheduled to be delivered in  six are scheduled to be delivered in and the remaining three are scheduled to be delivered in our objective is to develop and maintain a diverse and stable operating lease portfolio and  in that regard  our investment strategy is oriented towards longer term holding horizons rather than shorter term trading 
however  we review our operating lease portfolio periodically to make opportunistic divestures of aircraft and to manage our portfolio diversification  and in we sold the following aircraft three boeing model s  in may  two boeing model s  one in july and one in september  one boeing model er  in november  one boeing model  in december  and one airbus model a in december 
these sales resulted in a pre tax gain of million and end of lease maintenance revenue of million which are included in other income expense and lease rental revenue  respectively  on our consolidated statement of income

finance we have typically financed the initial purchase of aircraft using short term credit arrangements and cash on hand 
we then refinanced these short term credit facilities on a long term basis with the net proceeds from subsequent securitizations  bank debt and equity offerings 
our debt financing arrangements are typically secured by the acquired aircraft and related leases  and the financing parties have limited recourse to aircastle limited 
while such financing has historically been available on reasonable terms given the loan to value profile we have pursued  the current financial markets turmoil has significantly reduced the availability of both debt and equity capital 
though we expect the financing market to improve in time  we are presently taking a cautious approach to incremental financing and with respect to refinancing risk 
to the extent that we acquire additional aircraft directly  we intend to fund such investments through medium to longer term financings and cash on hand 
we may repay all or a portion of such borrowings from time to time with the net proceeds from subsequent long term debt financings  additional equity offerings or cash generated from operations and asset sales 
therefore  our ability to execute our business strategy  particularly the acquisition of additional commercial jet aircraft or other aviation assets  depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain additional debt and equity capital on terms we deem attractive

table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and currently available information 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most subjective judgments  estimates and assumptions 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
lease revenue recognition our operating lease rentals are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
we will neither recognize revenue nor record a receivable from a customer when collectability is not reasonably assured 
estimating whether collectability is reasonably assured requires some level of subjectivity and judgment 
when collectability is not reasonably assured  the customer is placed on non accrual status and revenue is recognized when cash payments are received 
management determines whether customers should be placed on non accrual status 
when we are reasonably assured that payments will be received in a timely manner  the customer is placed on accrual status 
the accrual non accrual status of a customer is maintained at a level deemed appropriate based on factors such as the customer credit rating  payment performance  financial condition and requests for modifications of lease terms and conditions 
events or circumstances outside of historical customer patterns can also result in changes to a customer s accrual status 
maintenance payments typically  under an operating lease  the lessee is required to make payments for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain high value components of the aircraft 
these maintenance payments are based on hours or cycles of utilization or on calendar time  depending upon the component  and are required to be made monthly in arrears or at the end of the lease term 
whether to permit a lessee to make maintenance payments at the end of the lease term  rather than requiring such payments to be made monthly  depends on a variety of factors  including the creditworthiness of the lessee  the level of security deposit which may be provided by the lessee and market conditions at the time we enter into the lease 
if a lessee is making monthly maintenance payments  we would typically be obligated to use the funds paid by the lessee during the lease term to reimburse the lessee for costs they incur for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain high value components  usually shortly following completion of the relevant work 
we record maintenance payments paid by the lessee as accrued maintenance liabilities in recognition of our contractual commitment to refund such receipts as discussed above 
in these contracts  we do not recognize such maintenance payments as revenue during the lease 
reimbursements to the lessee upon the receipt of evidence of qualifying maintenance work are charged against the existing accrued maintenance liability 
we defer income recognition of all maintenance reserve payments collected until the end of the lease  when we are able to determine the amount by which reserve payments received exceed costs to be incurred by the current lessee in performing scheduled maintenance 
in addition  many of our leases contain provisions which may require us to pay a portion of costs for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain high value components in excess of the amounts paid to us by the lessee 
we estimate the amount of our liability for such costs  typically for the first major maintenance event for the airframe  engines  landing gear and auxiliary power units  
table of contents expected to be paid to the lessee based on assumed utilization of the related aircraft by the lessee  the anticipated amount of the maintenance event cost and estimated amounts the lessee is responsible to pay 
this estimated maintenance liability is recognized as a reduction of lease revenue on a straight line basis as lease incentives over the life of the lease 
flight equipment held for lease flight equipment held for lease is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method  typically over a year life from the date of manufacture for passenger aircraft and over a year life for freighter aircraft  depending on whether the aircraft is a converted or purpose built freighter  to estimated residual values 
estimated residual values are generally determined to be approximately of the manufacturer s estimated realized price for passenger aircraft when new and for freighter aircraft when new 
management may make exceptions to this policy on a case by case basis when  in its judgment  the residual value calculated pursuant to this policy does not appear to reflect current expectations of value 
examples of situations where exceptions may arise include but are not limited to flight equipment where estimates of the manufacturer s realized sales prices are not relevant eg  freighter conversions  flight equipment where estimates of the manufacturers realized sales prices are not readily available  and flight equipment which may have a shorter useful life due to obsolescence 
in accounting for flight equipment held for lease  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  the fair value of attached leases  acquired maintenance liabilities and the estimated residual values 
in making these estimates  we rely upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and our anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
as part of our due diligence review of each aircraft we purchase  we prepare an estimate of the expected maintenance payments and any excess costs which may become payable by us  taking into consideration the then current maintenance status of the aircraft and the relevant provisions of any existing lease 
determining the fair value of attached leases requires us to make assumptions regarding the current fair values of leases for specific aircraft 
we estimate a range of current lease rates of like aircraft in order to determine if the attached lease is within a fair value range 
if a lease is below or above the range of current lease rates  we present value the estimated amount below or above fair value range over the remaining term of the lease 
the resulting lease discounts or premiums are amortized into lease rental income over the remaining term of the lease 
our flight equipment held for lease is evaluated for impairment at least annually or when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
indicators include third party appraisals of our aircraft  adverse changes in market conditions for specific aircraft types and the occurrence of significant adverse changes in general industry and market conditions that could affect the fair value of our aircraft 
derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business we utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risks 
we account for derivative instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  or sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
we determine fair value for our united states dollar denominated interest rate swaps by calculating reset rates and discounting cash flows based on cash rates  futures rates and swap rates in effect at the period close 
we determine the fair value of our united states dollar denominated guaranteed notional balance interest rate swaps based on the upper notional band using cash flows discounted at relevant market interest rates in effect at the period close 

table of contents when hedge treatment is achieved under sfas no 
 the changes in fair values related to the effective portion of the derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
the ineffective portion of the derivative contract is calculated and recorded in interest expense on our consolidated statement of income at each quarter end 
for any interest rate swap not designated as a hedge under sfas no 
 all mark to market adjustments are recognized in other income expense on our consolidated statement of income 
at inception of the hedge  we choose a method to assess effectiveness and to calculate ineffectiveness  which we must use for the life of the hedge relationship 
historically  we have designated the change in variable cash flows method for calculation of hedge ineffectiveness 
this calculation  only available for swaps designated at execution  involves a comparison of the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the variable leg of the swap against the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future interest cash flows on the floating rate liability 
when the change in the swaps variable leg exceeds the change in the liability  the calculated ineffectiveness is recorded in interest expense on our consolidated statement of income 
effectiveness is tested by dividing the change in the derivative variable leg by the change in the liability 
we use the hypothetical trade method for hedge relationships designated after execution that did not qualify for the change in variable cash flow method under sfas no 
we are increasingly designating the hypothetical trade method for all new hedge relationships 
the calculation involves a comparison of the change in the fair value of a swap to the change in the fair value of a hypothetical swap with critical terms that reflect the hedged debt 
when the change in the swap exceeds the change in the hypothetical swap  the calculated ineffectiveness is recorded in interest expense on our consolidated statement of income 
the effectiveness of these relationships is tested by regressing historical changes in the swap against historical changes in the hypothetical swap 
income taxes aircastle provides for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas no 
sfas no 
requires an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities using enacted rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount estimated by us to be realizable 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  effective january  fin addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  the company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities 
we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits and there was no effect on our financial condition or results of operations as a result of implementing fin recent accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  which permits an entity to measure certain eligible financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value that are not currently measured at fair value 
the company did not elect to measure any additional financial instruments at fair value for its financial assets and liabilities existing at january  and did not elect the fair value option on financial assets and liabilities transacted in the year ended december  therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

on september   one of our subsidiaries  acs limited  or acs bermuda  entered into a five year  million term debt facility  which we refer to as term financing no

table of contents payment of expenses related to the aircraft  fees of administration and fees and expenses of service providers  interest and principal on the loans  and amounts owed to interest rate hedge providers

loan documents 
borrowings under term financing no 
bear interest on the basis of three month libor plus per annum or  if greater  on the basis of the lenders cost of funds rate plus a margin  currently per annum 
the loans provide for quarterly payments of interest and scheduled payments of principal 
the loans may be prepaid upon notice  subject to certain conditions  and the payment of expenses  if any  and in some cases the payment of a prepayment premium on amounts prepaid on or before september  term financing no 
requires our relevant subsidiaries to satisfy certain financial covenants  including the maintenance of loan to value and interest coverage ratios 
the loan to value ratio begins at of appraised value and reduces over time to of appraised value approximately months after closing 
the interest coverage test compares available cash  being the amount by which rentals received in the preceding six month period exceeds any re leasing costs and servicing fees  to interest on the loans net of interest rate hedging during that period 
the interest coverage ratio tests  on any quarterly payment date  whether available cash exceeds net interest costs by a factor of three rising over time to five  in the fifth year after closing  and the covenant will be breached if the test fails on any two consecutive quarterly payment dates 
compliance with these covenants depends substantially upon the appraised value of the aircraft securing term financing no 
 the timely receipt of lease payments from the relevant lessees and on our ability to utilize the cure rights provided to us in the loan documents 
failure to comply with the loan to value test  or to comply with the interest coverage test at a time when we are also in breach of a modified version of the loan to value test  would result in a default under term financing no 
in the absence of cure payments by us

committed amounts for the purchase of aircraft and related flight equipment and improvements include estimated amounts for pre delivery deposits  engine acquisition costs  contractual price escalation and other adjustments 
in february  we amended the airbus a agreement to defer the scheduled delivery of an aircraft from the fourth quarter of to the first half of as a result  our committed amounts for the purchase of aircraft and related flight equipment and improvements  including estimated amounts for pre delivery deposits  configuration changes  engine acquisition costs  contractual price escalation and other adjustments  will be approximately million million less than year  million years and  million years 
capital expenditures we make capital expenditures from time to time in connection with improvements made to our aircraft 
these expenditures include the cost of major overhauls necessary to place an aircraft in service and modifications made at the request of lessees 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred a total of million  million and million  respectively  of capital expenditures related to the acquisition of aircraft 
as of december   the weighted average by net book value age of our aircraft was approximately years 
in general  the costs of operating an aircraft  including maintenance expenditures  increase with the age of the aircraft 
under our leases  the lessee is primarily responsible for maintaining the aircraft 
we may incur additional maintenance and modification costs in the future in the event we are required to remarket an aircraft or a lessee fails to meet its maintenance obligations under the lease agreement 
at december   we had million of maintenance reserves as a liability on our balance sheet 
these maintenance reserves are paid by the lessee to provide for future maintenance events 
provided a lessee performs scheduled maintenance of the aircraft  we are required to reimburse the lessee for scheduled maintenance payments 
in certain cases  we are also required to make lessor contributions  in excess of amounts a lessee may have paid  towards the costs of maintenance events performed by or on behalf of the lessee 
actual maintenance payments to us by lessees in the future may be less than projected as a result of a number of factors  including defaults by the lessees 
maintenance reserves may not cover the entire amount of actual maintenance expenses incurred and  where these expenses are not otherwise covered by the lessees  there can be no assurance that our operational cash flow and maintenance reserves will be sufficient to fund maintenance requirements  particularly as our aircraft age 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our leases if lessees are unable to fund their maintenance requirements on our aircraft  our cash flow and our ability to meet our debt obligations or to pay dividends on our common shares could be adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  foreign currency risk and foreign operations at december   all of our lease rentals are payable to us in us dollars 
however  we incur euro and singapore dollar denominated expenses in connection with our subsidiary in ireland and branch office in singapore 
as of december   of our employees were based in ireland and three employees were based in singapore 
for the year ended december   expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  such as payroll and office costs  aggregated approximately million in us dollar equivalents and represented approximately of total selling  general and administrative expenses 
our international operations are a significant component of our business strategy and permit us to more effectively source new aircraft  service the aircraft we own and maintain contact with our lessees 
therefore  it is likely that our international operations and 
table of contents our exposure to foreign currency risk will increase over time 
although we have not yet entered into foreign currency hedges because our exposure to date has not been significant  if our foreign currency exposure increases we may enter into hedging transactions in the future to mitigate this risk 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred insignificant net gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
hedging the objective of our hedging policy is to adopt a risk averse position with respect to changes in interest rates 
accordingly  we have entered into a number of interest rate swaps and interest rate forward contracts to hedge the current and expected future interest rate payments on our variable rate debt 
interest rate swaps are agreements in which a series of interest rate cash flows are exchanged with a third party over a prescribed period 
an interest rate forward contract is an agreement to make or receive a payment at the end of the period covered by the contract  with reference to a change in interest rates 
the notional amount on a swap or forward contract is not exchanged 
our swap transactions typically provide that we make fixed rate payments and receive floating rate payments to convert our floating rate borrowings to fixed rate obligations to better match the largely fixed rate cash flows from our investments in flight equipment and debt investments 
we held the following interest rate derivative contracts as of december  in thousands of dollars mandatory future fair value of current early maximum derivative notional effective termination maturity notional floating fixed asset or hedged item amount date date date amount rate rate liability securitization no

as of december   all of our derivatives are held with counterparties or guarantors of these counterparties who are considered highly rated rated a or above by moody s 
as a result  we do not anticipate that any of these counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
in february  we terminated an interest rate swap  with a notional amount of million as of december  and million as of the termination date  related to a repurchase agreement we repaid when the underlying debt investments were sold  resulting in a loss of million  which is included in interest expense on the consolidated statement of income 
similarly  in march  we terminated an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million related to a repurchase agreement we repaid  resulting in a loss of million  which is included in interest expense on the consolidated statement of income 
in march  we terminated an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million and partially terminated an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million  resulting in a net deferred loss of million  which will be amortized into interest expense using the interest rate method 
in june  the remaining portion of the swap that had been partially terminated was fully terminated  resulting in an additional net deferred loss of million being amortized into interest expense using the interest rate method 
these swaps were hedging interest payments related to borrowings under amended credit facility no 
and term financing no 

table of contents in may  we determined that the interest rate swap that was hedging interest payments related to future debt borrowings was no longer highly effective and no longer qualified for hedge accounting under sfas no 
and  accordingly  a deferred loss in the amount of million for this swap will be amortized into interest expense using the cash flow method 
in december  this interest rate swap was terminated 
all mark to market adjustments have been charged to other income expense 
the loss charged to other income expense through december  was million 
in june  we terminated an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million related to a repurchase agreement we repaid  resulting in a gain of thousand  which is included in interest expense on the consolidated statement of income 
also in june  we terminated interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million and million and partially terminated interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million and million  resulting in a net deferred loss of million  which will be amortized into interest expense using the interest rate method 
these swaps were hedging interest payments related to borrowings under amended credit facility no 
 term financing no 
 term financing no 
 and future debt and securitizations 
the remaining portions of the two partially terminated swaps were re designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes on june  and were subsequently fully terminated in october and december  respectively  resulting in an additional net deferred loss of million which will be amortized into interest expense using the interest rate method 
on june   we entered into two amortizing interest rate swap contracts with a balance guarantee notional and initial notional amounts of million and million 
the balance guarantee notional has a lower and upper notional band that adjusts to the outstanding principle balance on term financing no 
we entered into these interest rate hedging arrangements in connection with term financing no 
in order to effectively pay interest at a fixed rate on a substantial portion of the loans under this facility 
these interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes on june  in october  we entered into a series of interest rate forward rate contracts with an initial notional amount of million 
although we entered into this arrangement to hedge the variable interest payments in connection with term financing no 
 this instrument has not been designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes 
all mark to market adjustments related to these contracts are being charged directly to other income expense on the consolidated statement of income 
the loss charged to other income expense through december  was million 
in december  we terminated interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million and million  resulting in a net deferred loss of million  which will be amortized into interest expense using the interest rate method 
these swaps were hedging interest payments related to borrowings under future debt and securitizations 
for the twelve months ended december   none of the deferred loss was reclassified into interest expense on the consolidated statement of income due to the fact that the hedged interest payments were related to the anticipated long term financing of our new a aircraft purchase commitment  which were not scheduled to begin until the weighted average interest pay rates of these derivatives at december  and december  were and  respectively 
generally  our interest rate derivative contracts are hedging current interest payments on debt and future interest payments on long term debt 
in the past  we have entered into forward starting interest rate derivative contracts to hedge the anticipated interest payment on long term financings 
these forward starting contracts were terminated and new  specifically tailored hedging arrangements were entered into upon closing of the relevant long term financing 
we have also early terminated interest rate derivative contracts in an attempt to manage our exposure to collateral calls

related party transactions prior to our initial public offering  substantially all of the ownership interests in aircastle were beneficially owned by our employees and funds managed by affiliates of fortress 
in  fortress committed to invest million of equity in aircastle  all of which was drawn as of december  on february   the fortress funds contributed an additional million in exchange for  of our common shares 
on july   we returned the million to the fortress funds in exchange for the cancellation of  of our common shares 
in conjunction with the follow on public offering of our common shares on october   certain fortress shareholders offered  secondary common shares in a public offering  including  common shares from the selling fortress shareholders pursuant to the underwriter s option to cover over allotments 
following this offering  funds managed by the fortress shareholders and certain officers of fortress investment group llc beneficially owned approximately of the company s common shares 
the company did not receive any funds from this secondary offering by the fortress shareholders 
inflation inflation generally affects our costs  including sg a expenses and other expenses 
inflation also will increase the price of the airframes and engines we purchase under the airbus af agreement  although we have agreed with the manufacturers to certain limitations on price escalation in order to reduce our exposure to inflation 
our contractual commitments described elsewhere in this report include estimates we have made concerning the impact of inflation on our acquisition cost under the airbus af agreement 
we do not believe that our financial results have been  or will be  adversely affected by inflation in a material way 

table of contents management s use of ebitda we define ebitda as income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  interest expense  and depreciation and amortization 
we use ebitda to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance  and we believe this non gaap measure is helpful in identifying trends in our performance 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieving optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
ebitda provides us with a measure of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges on our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results 
accordingly  this metric measures our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short term  namely the cost structure  or expenses  of the organization 
ebitda is one of the metrics used by senior management and the board of directors to review the consolidated financial performance of our business 
limitations of ebitda ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool 
it should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures of earnings 
material limitations in making the adjustments to our earnings to calculate ebitda  and using this non gaap financial measure as compared to gaap net income  include depreciation and amortization  though not directly affecting our current cash position  represent the wear and tear and or reduction in value of our aircraft  which affects the aircraft s availability for use and may be indicative of future needs for capital expenditures  and the cash portion of income tax benefit provision generally represents charges gains  which may significantly affect our financial results 
an investor or potential investor may find this item important in evaluating our performance  results of operations and financial position 
we use non gaap financial measures to supplement our gaap results in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
ebitda is not an alternative to net income  income from operations or cash flows provided by or used in operations as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
you should not rely on ebitda as a substitute for any such gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of ebitda to gaap net income  along with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we also strongly urge you to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
in addition  because ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and is susceptible to varying calculations  the ebitda measure  as presented in this annual report  may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the table below shows the reconciliation of net income to ebitda for the years ended december   and

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest rate risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in the level of interest rates and the spread between different interest rates 
these risks are highly sensitive to many factors  including us monetary and tax policies  us and international economic factors and other factors beyond our control 
we are exposed to changes in the level of interest rates and to changes in the relationship or spread between interest rates 
our primary interest rate exposures relate to our lease agreements  debt investments  floating rate debt obligations and interest rate derivative instruments 
rent payments under our aircraft lease agreements typically do not vary during the term of the lease according to changes in interest rates 
similarly  our debt investments are predominately collateralized by fixed rate aircraft leases  and provide for a fixed coupon interest rate 
however  our borrowing agreements generally require payments based on a variable interest rate index  such as libor 
therefore  to the extent our borrowing costs are not fixed  increases in interest rates may reduce our net income by increasing the cost of our debt without any corresponding increase in rents or cash flow from our securities 
changes in interest rates may also impact our net book value as our derivative instruments and debt investments are periodically marked to market through stockholders equity 
generally  we are exposed to loss on our fixed pay interest rate swaps and interest rate forward contracts to the extent interest rates decrease below their contractual fixed rate 
also  as interest rates increase  the value of our fixed rate debt investments generally decreases 
the magnitude of the decrease is a function of the difference between the coupon rate and the current market rate of interest  the average life of the securities and the face amount of the securities 
the relationship between spreads on debt investments and derivative instruments may vary from time to time  resulting in a net aggregate book value increase or decrease 
changes in the general level of interest rates also can affect our ability to acquire new investments and our ability to realize gains from the settlement of such assets 
sensitivity analysis the following discussion about the potential effects of changes in interest rates is based on a sensitivity analysis  which models the effects of hypothetical interest rate shifts on our financial condition and results of operations 
we changed our interest rate risk disclosure to an alternative that provides more meaningful analysis of our interest rate risk 
although we believe a sensitivity analysis provides the most meaningful analysis permitted by the rules and regulations of the sec  it is constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and by the inability to include the extraordinarily complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
although the following results of a sensitivity analysis for changes in interest rates may have some limited use as a benchmark  they should not be viewed as a forecast 
this forward looking disclosure also is selective in nature and addresses only the potential 
table of contents minimum contracted rental and interest expense impacts on our financial instruments and our variable rate leases and  in particular  does not address the mark to market impact on our derivative instruments 
it also does not include a variety of other potential factors that could affect our business as a result of changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point increase decrease in our variable interest rates would increase decrease the minimum contracted rentals on our portfolio for the year ending december  by million 
a hypothetical basis point increase decrease in our variable interest rate on our borrowings would result in an interest expense increase decrease of million and million  net of amounts received from our interest rate hedges  for the years ending december  and  respectively
