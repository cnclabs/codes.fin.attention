item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in item of part ii of this form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing  manufacturing and commercializing important medicines for patients with cancer and other life threatening conditions 
we operate in three business segments products  royalties and contract manufacturing 
we have a portfolio of four marketed products  oncaspar  depocyt  abelcet and adagen 
our drug development programs utilize several innovative approaches  including our industry leading pegylation technology platform and the locked nucleic acid lna technology 
our pegylation technology was used to develop two of our products  oncaspar and adagen  and has created a royalty revenue stream from licensing partnerships for other products developed using the technology 
we also engage in contract manufacturing opportunities for several pharmaceutical companies to broaden our revenue base 
results of operations summary level overview year ended december  compared to total revenues  in rose to million compared to million in net product sales and contract manufacturing revenues both rose in  contributing approximately million to total revenue growth for the year 
partially offsetting this increase was an percent decline  or million  in royalty revenues during in august  we sold a percent interest in peg intron royalties  so an overall decrease in royalty revenues of percent indicates underlying growth in the segment 
gross margins were slightly improved in compared to with efficiencies stemming from the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities beginning to be experienced late in spending was up in both research and development and general and administrative areas 
the primary cause of the incremental general and administrative costs was the evaluation of strategic alternatives and efforts to improve our capital structure totaling approximately million in we incurred million of restructuring charges which was million less than in and interest expense was lower in than in by million due primarily to the repayment of our notes 
also  significantly affecting the year to year comparison  was the gain in of million on the sale of the percent interest in peg intron royalties 
summary level overview year ended december  compared to total revenues of million were unchanged in compared to products segment revenues remained constant as a group 
a reduction in fourth quarter royalty revenues from peg intron due to the sale of a percent interest therein in august was offset by a rise in contract manufacturing revenues for the year 
income before tax for the year ended december  was million compared to million in major operating factors contributing to the rise were the gain on the sale of the royalty interest of million partially offset by million of restructuring costs 
company wide spending on research and development rose approximately million in compared to  but acquired in process research and development expenditures of million experienced in were not repeated in other major effects include million of legal costs related to securing the supply of oncaspar raw material in  not incurred in  a million gain on sale of equity securities in not recurring in and lower interest expense in of million compared to  due to the refinancing and repurchases of our debt 
further discussion of these and other revenue and profitability fluctuations is contained in the segment analyses that follow 
the percentage changes throughout management s discussion and analysis are based on amounts stated in thousands of dollars and not the rounded millions of dollars reflected in this section 
following is a reconciliation of segment profitability to consolidated loss income before income tax provision millions of dollars overview year ended december december december products segment profit royalties segment profit contract manufacturing segment profit corporate and other expenses loss income before income tax provision includes million gain on sale of percent interest in peg intron royalties 
we do not allocate certain corporate income and expenses not directly identifiable with the respective segments  including exploratory and preclinical research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  depreciation  investment income  interest income  interest expense or income taxes 
research and development expense is considered a corporate expense unless it relates to an existing marketed product or a product candidate enters phase iii clinical trials at which time related costs would be chargeable to one of our operating segments 
products segment products segment profitability millions of dollars year ended december change december change december revenues cost of product sales research and development selling and marketing amortization of intangibles restructuring charge nm segment profit nm not meaningful revenues sales performance of individual products is provided below millions of dollars product year ended december change december change december oncaspar depocyt abelcet adagen totals year ended december  compared to net product sales grew approximately percent during  rising to million from million in our oncology product  oncaspar  for the first line treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia all and adagen  our treatment for immunodeficiency  accounted for the majority of this increase 
oncaspar volume increased percent year over year with the remaining oncaspar revenue growth being attributable to a price increase effective in the first quarter of this price increase was necessitated by significantly higher raw material cost and expenses related to the development of manufacturing process improvements and transfer of technology from our supplier 
see cost of product sales and research and development expenses below for further discussion regarding increased production costs and production process enhancements 
adagen sales were favorably affected by a first quarter price increase 
abelcet  for the treatment of invasive fungal infections  continues to experience competitive pressures in the marketplace 
the percent decline in abelcet net sales was the result of approximately percent volume reduction and approximately percent decrease in average net selling price 
sales of depocyt  for treatment of lymphomatous meningitis  and adagen have historically experienced period to period fluctuations due to their small patient bases 
year ended december  compared to net product sales of million for were largely unchanged on an aggregate basis from the total reached in  however  the composition of sales by product reflected some significant shifts 
sales of oncaspar  grew million or percent in to million 
the growth in volume of oncaspar during was approximately percent 
the us food and drug administration fda approved oncaspar for the first line treatment of patients with all in july the increase in oncaspar sales was attributable to the continued transition to its first line use and the adoption of protocols in pediatric and adult patients some of which call for dosage regimens that include a greater number of weeks of oncaspar therapy 
there was also an april  price increase 
sales of depocyt and adagen  tend to fluctuate from period to period 
adagen sales in were somewhat elevated due to a newly negotiated distributor contract and that distributor adjusting inventory levels in line with industry norms 
both depocyt and adagen were impacted by an april  price increase 
in april  the fda granted full approval of depocyt 
originally  depocyt was conditionally approved under the fda s subpart h regulation 
sales of abelcet  in the us and canada  at million  were percent lower in than the million recorded in due to continued competition from the numerous therapeutics in the anti fungal market 
cost of product sales cost of sales of marketed products for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to million for the year costs rose at a slower rate than did revenues resulting in a decrease in cost of product sales as a percentage of sales  to approximately percent in from approximately percent in a number of significant events occurring in the manufacturing facilities  processes and sourcing of materials combined to make a transition year for cost of products sold 
during the second quarter of  we incurred million of accelerated amortization associated with a million licensing milestone payment that was triggered during that quarter in connection with our rights to market and distribute oncaspar 
we immediately recorded the million of amortization to reflect the benefit derived from the intangible over the entire life of the agreement 
the residual million of this milestone payment is being recognized in cost of sales over its remaining life of years 
in  we incurred a million charge for validation batches produced in connection with the transfer of production of oncaspar and adagen from our south plainfield  new jersey facility to our indianapolis  indiana facility 
the cost of producing oncaspar  as a percentage of oncaspar sales  rose nearly percent during compared to due primarily to the effects of raw material price increases under a december supply agreement 
the full effect of this cost increase was not reflected in cost of products sold until the latter half of as compared to a full year in largely offsetting the rise in oncaspar costs were improvements in the cost of manufacture of adagen and abelcet which together comprise nearly half of total net sales 
the improvements in the year to year comparisons of adagen and abelcet cost profiles are due in large part to certain batch write offs experienced during  including the validation batches referred to above in connection with the transfer of production to our indianapolis facility 
overall  gross margins were favorably affected by increased selling prices effected early in manufacturing efficiencies from the consolidation of our production facilities were not experienced until the fourth quarter of due to the timing of the completion of the consolidation 
their full effect should be realized in  however  we expect some moderation of this favorable influence to come by way of increasing raw materials prices 
in  cost of products sold  as a percentage of net sales  rose to approximately percent from percent in in december  we entered into supply and license agreements with ovation for the active ingredient used in the production of oncaspar 
a resulting license fee of million caused a million increase in amortization expense charged to oncaspar cost of products sold 
higher supplier costs of materials and negative production variances contributed to lower adagen and abelcet margins  respectively  in also  the ongoing transfer of production of oncaspar and adagen from our south plainfield facility to our indianapolis facility  discussed under restructuring below  resulted in million of cost related to required production test batches to validate the new production processes and assure continued product quality and stability 
research and development expenses research and development spending related to marketed products has been directed largely towards securing and maintaining a reliable supply of the ingredients used in the production of oncaspar and adagen 
products segment research and development expense increased million or percent during compared to which was up million or percent over as previously disclosed  we are investing in the next generation of l asparaginase  used in the production of oncaspar  and recombinant adenosine deaminase enzyme  used in the production of adagen 
during  we transferred the oncaspar manufacturing process technology to our contract manufacturing organization and initiated our pivotal clinical trial 
however  we also anticipated transferring the adagen manufacturing process to a contract manufacturing organization during during the year  we decided to further improve the adagen process in our internal process development lab 
as a result of this decision  our research and development expense for was lower than we had originally planned and this cost for the adagen technology transfer will now occur in we intend to continue to increase efforts to improve the manufacturing processes and pharmaceutical properties of both oncaspar and adagen over the next few years 
aggregate research and development expenditures in products segment and corporate are expected to be in the range of to million  approximately of which will be associated with the next generation oncaspar and adagen programs 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for our sales and marketing personnel  as well as other commercial expenses and marketing programs to support our sales force 
also included in selling and marketing expenses are the costs associated with our medical affairs function  including a medical science liaison group 
selling and marketing expenses declined million or approximately percent in when compared to due in large part to the consolidation and realignment of our sales forces in late also included in selling and marketing expenses are the costs associated with our medical affairs program  offsetting to some degree the savings from the sales force realignment 
for the year  selling expenses were million or percent lower than in selling and marketing expenses in had been somewhat higher due to focuses placed at that time on the first line approval of oncaspar for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and a repositioning of abelcet 
amortization of acquired intangibles amortization expense of approximately million in and and million in was principally related to abelcet intangible assets 
restructuring during the first quarter of  we announced plans to consolidate our manufacturing operations in our indianapolis location 
this action was taken as part of our continued efforts to streamline operations 
also  during  we combined our previous two specialized sales forces into one 
as a result of these two initiatives  we incurred restructuring charges of million during the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  all restructuring charges have been related to the products segment 
employee termination costs  consisting of severance and related benefits  amounted to million for the manufacturing restructuring during and million in severance payments related to the manufacturing restructuring commenced during with the successful transfer of production to the company s indianapolis facility and closure of the south plainfield facility and are expected to continue into the sales force realignment resulted in approximately million of employee termination costs  all of which were paid out during payments to terminated employees in connection with the manufacturing program have amounted to million 
also  during  prior accruals for certain benefits provided to exiting employees were adjusted downward by million based on actual utilization 
the severance liability as of december  was million 
write down of manufacturing assets and other costs associated with the manufacturing restructuring in totaled approximately million 
the majority of these costs relate to the acceleration of amortization of leasehold improvements at the south plainfield facility in resulting from a reassessment of the estimated time to complete the manufacturing consolidation 
during  we also accelerated the depreciation of certain assets consisting primarily of manufacturing equipment that would not be transferred to the indianapolis facility and were decommissioned 
our use of the leased south plainfield facility has ended  but we continue to incur monthly rental costs related to the facility aggregating million annually which we began charging to general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of prior to the fourth quarter of  while the facility was operational  these costs were included in cost of inventory 
we may experience additional restructuring charges associated with the lease or its termination prior to the contractual expiration of the lease in october royalties segment royalties segment profitability millions of dollars year ended december change december change december royalty revenue gain on sale of royalty interest nm nm segment profit nm nm nm not meaningful revenues the majority of royalty revenue relates to sales of peg intron  a peg enhanced version of schering plough s alpha interferon product  intron a  which is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c 
other royalty revenues and certain licensing revenues relate to the application of our technology to third party products including those under a cross license agreement with nektar therapeutics  inc nektar under which we receive a share of the royalties and licensing income received by nektar 
there are currently three third party products for which nektar has granted sublicenses to our pegylation technology and for which we are participating in royalty and licensing income revenues hoffmann la roche s pegasys for treatment of hepatitis c  ucb s cimzia for the treatment of crohn s disease and osi and pfizer s macugen for the treatment of neovascular wet age related macular degeneration 
our royalties on net sales of pegasys  which exceeded million in  will end in october total royalty revenue in was million  down percent from the level 
royalties associated with peg intron were approximately percent lower than the prior year 
the decline reflects the sale during of a percent interest in the peg intron royalties partially offset by improvement in the underlying sales of peg intron by schering plough 
this is consistent with schering plough s public filings wherein they indicate higher sales in international markets  including a favorable impact from foreign exchange which was tempered by lower sales in japan and the us royalty growth from cimzia  pegasys and oncaspar in non us markets also bolstered revenues for the segment in total royalty revenue of million in was percent lower than the million reported in the decline was primarily attributable to the fact that we sold a percent interest in royalties payable to it by schering plough corporation on net sales of peg intron occurring after june  in our fourth quarter of  because of the one quarter lag in royalty revenue recognition and the sale of percent of the revenue stream  we reported just percent of the total royalty revenues generated from sales of peg intron for the quarter ended september   compared to full recognition in all quarters of apart from the decrease in percentage of royalties received  there was a modest rise in sales of peg intron 
increased pegasys royalties were offset by the effects of competition for macugen in the us the gain on the sale of the percent interest in peg intron royalties  net of related costs  was million 
the purchaser of the royalty interest will be obligated to pay an additional million to us in the first quarter of if it achieves a certain threshold level of royalties on sales of peg intron occurring from july  through december  the million contingent gain will be recognized when and if the contingency is removed and collection is assured 
the future revenues to be received from the use of our technology are dependent upon numerous factors outside of our control such as competition and the effectiveness of marketing by our licensees 
these factors include the approval of new agents like hematide  new uses and geographies for peg intron and cimzia and changing competition 
costs and expenses current royalty revenues do not require any material specific administrative costs 
at some point in the future  costs associated with initiation of new out licensing agreements that could result in our receipt of a royalty stream and  if necessary  costs necessary to maintain the underlying technology may be charged to the royalties segment 
contract manufacturing segment contract manufacturing revenues are primarily comprised of revenues from the manufacture of myocet and abelcet for cephalon for the european market  and the manufacture of an injectable multivitamin  mvi  for hospira  inc hospira 
we entered into two additional manufacturing agreements in late contract manufacturing segment profitability millions of dollars year ended december change december change december revenues cost of sales segment profit revenues contract manufacturing revenue for was million or percent higher than the revenues generated during contract manufacturing revenue in was favorably affected by million of compensation received in for certain non routine services and timing of shipments to our customers adversely affecting and having a favorable effect on 
we do not anticipate the level of revenues recorded in will be achieved in in addition  our contract with hospira for the manufacture of mvi is scheduled to terminate effective april  mvi currently contributes more than a third of the segment s revenues 
also  our agreements with cephalon for the manufacture of myocet and abelcet are scheduled to expire in january and november  respectively  unless the parties agree to renew 
contract manufacturing revenue for rose percent to million over the million recorded in reflecting  in part  management s efforts to generate additional business in this segment and the reflection of a full year of business under two contracts entered into near the end of also  the revenue amount was adversely affected by a million billing adjustment 
cost of sales cost of sales for contract manufacturing for was million or approximately percent of sales compared to million or approximately percent of sales for two events have had a significant favorable influence on these cost comparisons 
cost of sales for  as a percentage of sales  was favorably affected by the above referenced non routine services which contributed million of revenues 
these services were performed in but recognition was delayed until all criteria for revenue recognition were met 
in addition  cost of sales for was adversely affected by certain start up costs related to a new customer arrangement 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales in percent was negatively impacted by the million billing adjustment referred to above which lowered sales with no effect on that year s costs 
non us revenue we had export sales and royalties recognized on export sales of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
of these amounts  sales in europe and royalties recognized on sales in europe  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our non us product sales and royalties are denominated in us dollars and are included in total revenues 
corporate and other expenses year ended december change december change december millions of dollars research and development general and administrative acquired in process research and development nm other income expense investment income  net interest expense other  net nm nm corporate and other expenses nm not meaningful research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  share based compensation and benefits  contractor and consulting fees  principally related to clinical and regulatory projects  costs related to research and development partnerships or licenses  drug supplies for clinical and preclinical activities  as well as other research supplies and facilities charges 
research and development expenses related to currently marketed products are excluded from these corporate amounts and are reported in the products segment 
our research and development expense is considered a corporate expense until a product candidate enters phase iii clinical trials at which time related costs would be chargeable to one of our operating segments 
we continue to invest in research and development to build a differentiated oncology business through the continued development of our current portfolio  reinforcing our position as a scientific leader in pegylation through our customized linker technology platform 
aggregate research and development expenditures in products segment and corporate are expected to be in the range of to million  approximately of which will be associated with advancing our technology 
corporate research and development for was relatively unchanged from levels achieved during  declining approximately percent to million 
work continued through on the phase i trials initiated during related to peg sn and hif alpha 
these phase i studies must be continued until a phase ii dose is identified which had not occurred as of december  as a result  we were unable to move into phase ii studies for the peg sn and hif alpha antagonist programs in  and our corporate research and development expense for was lower than originally planned 
we expect the initiation of phase ii studies and the related cost to be incurred in we incurred milestone payments aggregating million in related to an investigational new drug ind acceptance for survivin and acceptance of new lna compounds licensed from santaris pharma a s santaris 
spending on contracted services related to the programs during was somewhat less than that which was experienced during as included various start up costs 
partially offsetting the decline in contracted services during was a rise in compensation expense attributable in part to the continuing effects of share based compensation accounting rules effective in the accounting for stock options and nonvested share awards became a charge to expense when the new rules were adopted and  for a period of approximately four years after the adoption  we have experienced incremental layering of amortization of post adoption grants 
for the year  research and development spending was million as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to spending in on the new programs initiated during we filed an ind application and opened two phase i trials for peg sn also  we opened two phase i trials in the hif alpha antagonist subsequent to the ind filing in the quarter ended december  the hif alpha ind filing  approved by the fda in january  triggered a million license milestone payment to santaris 
this was recorded in research and development expense in in the fourth quarter of  we accepted two of the additional six oncology compounds licensed from santaris which prompted a million milestone payment 
in addition  compensation expense was affected by new hires and by the july  adoption of share based compensation rules that required a charge to expense for stock options and nonvested share awards 
this affected to comparisons due to the successive layering in of amortization of post adoption grants 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of outside professional services for accounting  audit  tax  legal  and financing activities  salaries and benefits for support functions  patent filing fees and facilities costs 
general and administrative expenses rose million or approximately percent in compared to the majority of the increase  approximately million  was related to our evaluation of strategic alternatives and improving our capital structure 
these costs  which included legal  accounting and professional fees  pertained in part to our study of possible alternative directions for the company including a spin off our biotechnology activities  selling the specialty pharmaceuticals business  or selling one or more of our marketed products and our indianapolis manufacturing facility 
for various reasons  none of these initiatives were consummated and on december   we halted our current pursuit of these initiatives 
we also undertook a solicitation of consent from holders of our convertible notes to amend the notes indenture and we commenced a tender offer for our notes in december other costs contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses included securing intellectual property rights for certain of our research and development efforts and incremental share based compensation to employees 
for a period of three to four years after the july adoption of new rules related to share based compensation  we have experienced upward pressure on share based compensation expense as amortization of additional grants has been layered into the computations 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  of million were lower by percent from levels of million 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  included million in legal costs incurred in connection with securing the supply of the raw material used to produce oncaspar 
the absence of this expense in the succeeding year largely explains the decline in general and administrative expense from to of million 
offsetting this decline  in part  was the effect of the july adoption of new share based compensation accounting rules 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development for the year ended december  was comprised of payments totaling million to santaris for rights to a total of eight rna antagonists based on lna technology 
because this technology was in the developmental stage  the payment was immediately charged to expense 
other income expense other income expense for the three years ended december   and was expense of million  expense of million and income of million  respectively 
the refinancing of a significant portion of our long term debt in and repurchase and retirement of our remaining notes payable in and affected the year to year comparisons in a number of ways refer to liquidity and capital resources below 
net investment income in was lower than in by approximately million due to a reduction in the amount of investment holdings during the year combined with lower interest rates 
we utilized million of investments held in restricted investments and cash as of december  to retire our remaining notes payable in july  the residual being returned to general corporate funds 
in addition  we recognized a non cash  impairment write down in of one auction rate security when the reduction in fair value was deemed to be other than temporary 
net investment income decreased by million to million for from million for due principally to the sale in of our remaining  shares of nektar therapeutics  inc common stock which resulted in a net gain of million that year 
interest expense  which includes amortization of deferred offering costs  has declined over the three year period from through  from million in to million in to million in this was due principally to the refinancing and repayment of our notes payable throughout this period 
the balance of notes payable at the beginning of was million with an interest rate of 
as of december   we had million of principal amount of notes outstanding carrying a rate of interest 
aggregate repurchases and retirements of our outstanding notes during and were million and million  respectively 
during  million principal amount of the notes was repurchased using the proceeds of our may issuance of million notes 
the refinancing resulted in the write off of approximately million of deferred offering costs in  contributing to higher than normal interest expense that year 
significant portions of other income relate to gains realized on repurchase of notes payable 
in  we repurchased million principal amount of our notes at a discount to par yielding a gain of approximately million 
we also repurchased a portion of our notes early in at a gain of million 
losses related to asset disposals and foreign exchange partially offset the gains on repurchase of notes payable 
in  repurchase of notes generated a gain of million and in  we realized a gain of million related to repurchase of million principal amount of the notes 
income taxes income tax expense is primarily comprised of certain state and canadian taxes 
no federal income tax expense is incurred in relation to normal operating results due either to current period operating losses or the utilization of deferred tax assets to offset taxes that would otherwise accrue to operating income 
the million tax expense recorded in included a federal income tax provision for alternative minimum tax related to the gain on sale of a royalty interest recognized that year 
liquidity and capital resources cash reserves  including cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities  totaled million as of december  at december   cash reserves also included restricted investments and cash of million and totaled million 
the primary reason for the decline in cash reserves during was the retirement of million of our convertible notes offset  in part  by cash provided by operating activities 
we invest our excess cash primarily in investment grade corporate debt securities 
as of december   aggregate cash reserves rose to million from million at december  net cash received on the sale of a percent interest in peg intron royalties of million  represented the largest single cash inflow and offset expenditures to redeem notes payable million  purchase property and equipment million and purchase oncaspar supply rights million 
the remaining increase in cash reserves arose principally from operations 
operating activities provided cash of million in  a reduction of million compared to the million of operating cash flows in the million gain in from the monetization of a portion of peg intron royalties represented the primary difference between the two years 
changes in various balance sheet accounts comprised the partially offsetting difference a source of cash in of approximately million and a use of cash in of approximately million 
cash provided by operating activities in of million exceeded that in by million 
this was due primarily to the rise in operating income 
the largest single factor in this increase from year to year was the million net gain on the sale of future peg intron royalties 
offsetting this cash inflow  in part  was the comparative change in operating assets and liabilities year over year aggregating to million 
cash was provided by investing activities in in the amount of million as marketable securities  including million of restricted investments  matured or were liquidated and million was invested in plant and equipment 
the proceeds of the restricted investments were used to repurchase our notes payable 
cash used in investing activities in of million was lower than the million expended in due primarily to the fact that  in  we made net incremental investments in marketable and equity securities of approximately million 
we also had greater investments in in product rights and in process research and development million in versus million in 
there was an offsetting increase in investments in property and equipment in of million when compared to the prior year 
financing activities in  and related almost entirely to the repurchase and refinancing of our long term debt as described below 
the repurchase of a portion of outstanding notes payable constituted a use of cash in of million and in of million 
the net result in of issuing the notes and partial repurchase of the notes was a source of cash of million 
in  we repurchased million principal amount of our notes for million 
as a result  as of december   we had outstanding million of convertible senior notes payable 
interest is payable on june and december accrued interest was million as of december  as a result of a tender offer to repurchase a portion of our outstanding notes  which commenced in december  million principal amount of the notes were tendered 
in january  we accepted and repurchased the million principal amount of notes at a purchase price of per  of principal amount 
from time to time  we may repurchase our notes in the open market  in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
during  we repurchased million principal amount of notes for million 
the second quarter issuance of the notes generated million of gross financing cash inflows million in may and million in june 
we incurred million of costs in connection with the note issuances including legal  accounting and underwriting fees 
the net proceeds of the note issuance were used to repurchase million face value million in may and million in july of notes outstanding at a purchase price of for each  principal amount plus accrued interest 
the combined purchase price was million and accrued interest amounted to million 
for a more detailed description of the terms of our convertible subordinated notes see contractual obligations below 
our current sources of liquidity are our cash reserves  interest earned on such cash reserves  sales of oncaspar  depocyt  abelcet and adagen  royalties earned which are primarily related to sales of peg intron  and contract manufacturing revenue 
based upon our current planned research and development activities and related costs and our current sources of liquidity  we anticipate our current cash reserves and expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our capital and operational requirements for the near future 
while we believe that our current sources of liquidity will be adequate to satisfy our capital and operational needs for the near future  we may enter into agreements with collaborators with respect to the development and commercialization of products that could increase our cash requirement or seek additional financing to fund future operations and potential acquisitions 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
see risk factors we will need to obtain additional financing to meet our future capital needs and our significant debt level may adversely affect our ability to do so 
failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spe  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any off balance sheet spe transactions 
our notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share and pose a reasonable likelihood of potential significant dilution 
at december   the maximum potential dilutive effect of conversion of the notes is million shares 
the notes are discussed in greater detail in liquidity and capital resources above and contractual obligations below 
in addition  stock options to purchase million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share and million restricted stock units were outstanding at december   that represent additional potential dilution 
contractual obligations our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to our notes payable  including interest  operating lease obligations  inventory purchase obligations and our license agreements with collaborative partners 
as of december   we had million of convertible senior unsecured notes outstanding 
these notes mature on june  unless earlier redeemed  repurchased or converted 
they may be converted at the option of the holders into our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
the notes rank equal to all future senior unsecured debt 
at any time on or after june   if the closing price of our common stock for at least trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the date one day prior to the date of a notice of redemption is greater than percent of the applicable conversion price on the date of such notice  we  at our option  may redeem the notes in whole or in part  at a redemption price in cash equal to percent of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  plus accrued interest  if any  to the redemption date 
the notes are not redeemable prior to june  upon occurrence of a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture governing the notes  holders of the notes may require us to redeem the notes at a price equal to percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest or  in certain cases  to convert the notes at an increased conversion rate based on the price paid per share of our common stock in the transaction constituting the fundamental change 
in august  we obtained the consent of holders of our convertible senior notes due to amend the indenture by i eliminating any exceptions to circumstances under which a sale  transfer or lease by us of all or substantially all of our properties or assets to another person would constitute a fundamental change as defined in the indenture  ii providing that we may not sell  transfer  lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our properties or assets unless a an amount in cash sufficient to satisfy its obligations under the indenture to repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change is designated by us for such purpose and held in a segregated account for business days after the consummation of the sale  transfer  lease or disposition transaction and b no default or event of default under the indenture will have occurred and be continuing  iii providing that upon a sale  transfer  lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of our properties or assets that is a fundamental change  the transferee will not be required to assume our obligations under the indenture and the notes  and iv increasing the number of additional shares issuable per  initial principal amount of notes upon conversion of the notes in connection with a fundamental change 
we lease three facilities in new jersey 
future minimum lease payments and commitments for operating leases total million at december under our exclusive license for the right to sell  market and distribute pacira s depocyt product  we are required to maintain sales levels of depocyt equal to million for each calendar year 
pacira is also entitled to a milestone payment of million if our sales of the product exceed a million annualized run rate for four consecutive quarters and an additional milestone payment of million if our sales exceed an annualized run rate of million for four consecutive quarters 
we are also responsible for a milestone payment of million if the product receives approval of an indication for all neoplastic meningitis 
to date  no milestone payments defined under the agreement have been achieved by us 
in december  we entered into supply and license agreements with ovation 
pursuant to the agreements  ovation committed to supply and we committed to purchase specified quantities of the active ingredient used in the production of oncaspar during calendar years and additionally  ovation granted to us a non exclusive  fully paid  perpetual  irrevocable  worldwide license to the cell line from which such ingredient is derived 
we agreed to effectuate  at our cost  a technology transfer of the cell line and manufacturing capabilities for the ingredient from ovation to us no later than december  we further agreed to supply specified quantities of the ingredient to ovation  at ovation s option  in calendar years if we fail to supply the specified quantities in  we will be required to pay damages to ovation in the amounts of million in  million in and million in in july  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with santaris for up to eight rna antagonists 
we obtained rights worldwide  other than in europe  to develop and commercialize rna antagonists directed against the hif l alpha and survivin gene targets  as well as rna antagonists directed against six additional gene targets selected by us 
we will be responsible for making additional payments upon the successful completion of certain compound synthesis and selection  clinical development and regulatory milestones 
in  we made million in milestone payments 
santaris is also eligible to receive royalties from any future product sales of products based on the licensed antagonists 
santaris retains the right to develop and commercialize products developed under the collaboration in europe 
under our exclusive license with sanofi aventis for marketing and distribution of oncaspar in the us and canada  we were obligated to pay million if net sales exceed million for two consecutive years 
as of june   achievement of the two year net sales threshold was considered probable  and the million liability was recorded 
the payment was due and made in january contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment

our convertible notes are payable on june  critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the us all professional accounting standards effective as of december  have been taken into consideration in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
some of those estimates are subjective and complex  and  consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following accounting policies and estimates have been highlighted as significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates  to the extent possible  on historical experience 
historical information is modified as appropriate based on current business factors and various assumptions that we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes when necessary 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
revenues revenues from product sales are recognized when title passes to the customer  generally at the time product is received 
for product sales  we record a provision at the time of shipment for estimated future credits  chargebacks  sales discounts  rebates and returns 
these sales provision accruals  except for rebates which are recorded as a liability  are presented as a reduction of the accounts receivable balances 
we recognize revenues for abelcet at the time of sale to the wholesaler 
sales of oncaspar and depocyt are recorded when product shipped by our third party distributor to the end user is received 
adagen is sold directly to a specialty distributor that then sells the product to end users 
we recognize revenue for adagen upon sale to the specialty distributor 
we provide chargeback payments to the wholesalers based on their sales to members of buying groups at prices determined under a contract between ourselves and the member 
administrative fees are paid to buying groups based on the total amount of purchases by their members 
we estimate the amount of the chargeback that will be paid using a distribution channel information obtained from certain of our wholesalers which allows us to determine the amount and expiry of inventory in the distribution channel and b historical trends  adjusted for current conditions 
the settlement of the chargebacks generally occurs within three months after the sale to the wholesaler 
we regularly analyze the historical chargeback trends and make adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends 
in addition  state agencies that administer various programs  such as the us medicaid programs  receive rebates 
medicaid rebates and administrative fees are recorded as a liability and a reduction of gross sales when we record the sale of the product 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount  we use a distribution channel information obtained from certain of our wholesalers which allows us to determine the amount and expiry of inventory in the distribution channel  b our historical rebate and administrative fee payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales  and c any significant changes in sales trends 
current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations  and the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid patients are also evaluated 
factors that complicate the rebate calculations are the timing of the average manufacturer pricing computation  the lag time between sale and payment of a rebate  which can range up to nine months  and the level of reimbursement by state agencies 
the following is a summary of gross to net sales reductions that are accrued on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and in thousands chargebacks cash discounts other including returns medicaid rebates medicaid administrative fees total balance at december  provision related to sales made in current period provision related to sales made in prior period returns and credits balance at december  provision related to sales made in current period provision related to sales made in prior period returns and credits balance at december  reported as a reduction of accounts receivable 
reported as an accrued liability 
approximately percent and percent relates to abelcet in and  respectively

royalties under our license agreements with third parties are recognized when reasonably determinable and earned through the sale of the product by the licensee net of future credits  chargebacks  sales discount rebates and refunds and collection is reasonably assured 
notification from the third party licensee of the royalties earned under the license agreement is the basis for royalty revenue recognition 
this information is generally received from the licensees in the quarter subsequent to the period in which the sales occur 
revenues from contract manufacturing are recognized when title passes to the customer  generally at the time of shipment 
at the request of the customer  certain contract manufacturing arrangements involve the transfer of title of the finished product to the customer prior to shipment 
the product in question is manufactured to the unique specifications of the customer and cannot be used to fill other orders 
if all necessary conditions are met  including the product is complete and ready for shipment  the risks of ownership have passed to the customer and the customer pays for storage of the product at our facility  we will recognize revenue upon transfer of title 
non refundable milestone payments that represent the completion of a separate earnings process are recognized as revenue when earned  upon the occurrence of contract specified events 
non refundable payments received upon entering into license and other collaborative agreements where we have continuing involvement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the estimated service period 
income taxes under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets is provided for when it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be not realized 
as of december   we believe  based on future projections  that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets  including our net operating losses from operating activities and stock option exercises  will not be realized 
we recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position that we have taken or expect to take on the income tax returns we file if it is more likely than not we will be able to sustain our position 
long lived asset impairment analysis long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment when impairment indicators are present 
impairment indicators are events or circumstances that may be indicative of possible impairment such as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  a current period operating loss combined with a history of operating losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group 
testing for the recoverability of amortizable intangible assets is performed initially by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the assets 
if the undiscounted net cash flow stream exceeds the carrying amount  no further analysis is required 
however  if this test shows a negative relationship  the fair value of the assets within the asset group must be determined and we would record an impairment charge for any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value 
these evaluations involve amounts and forecasts that are based on management s best estimates and judgment 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
share based payments we account for share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements  measured by the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued  adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
we have elected the modified prospective transition method which requires that compensation costs be recorded  as earned  for all unvested stock options and restricted stock awards outstanding at june  the impact that share based payment awards will have on our results of operations is a function of the number of shares awarded  vesting and the trading price of our stock at date of grant  combined with the application of the black scholes valuation model 
fair value of share based payments is determined using the black scholes valuation model which employs weighted average assumptions for expected volatility of the company s stock  expected term until exercise of the options  the risk free interest rate  and dividends  if any 
expected volatility is based on historical enzon stock price information 
recently issued accounting standards effective january   we adopted the provisions related to financial assets and liabilities of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 
 as amended 
sfas no 
provides guidance on the use of fair value in accounting and disclosure for assets and liabilities when such accounting and disclosure is called for by other accounting literature 
as amended by financial accounting standards board fasb staff position fsp  the applicability of sfas no 
for most nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities has been delayed to for calendar year companies 
we currently have no financial assets or liabilities for which we recognize in earnings periodic gains or losses resulting from fair value fluctuations 
we have no significant nonfinancial assets or liabilities that we expect will be affected in when sfas no 
becomes fully effective 
in december  the fasb issued two statements that would apply prospectively to potential  business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  early application is not permitted 
these pronouncements would be adopted at such time as we undertake a business combination and will have no impact on our current financial statements 
sfas no 
r  business combinations  retains the fundamental requirements of purchase accounting but requires  among other things  the recognition and measurement of any noncontrolling interest and certain previously unrecognized intangible assets such as in process research and development 
it also calls for the recognition of most acquisition costs as expense rather than part of the total acquisition cost and the recognition of a gain in the event of a bargain purchase rather than negative goodwill 
sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
in december  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for collaborative agreements 
effective beginning in  the consensus prohibits participants in a collaborative agreement from applying the equity method of accounting to activities performed outside a separate legal entity and requires gross or net presentation of revenues and expenses by the respective parties depending upon their roles in the collaboration 
we are not presently a participant in such collaborative agreements 
accordingly  this consensus will have no impact on our current financial statements 
in june  the eitf issued eitf  determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock 
the issue addresses the determination of whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock and establishes a two step approach with which to make the determination 
under current us gaap  the conversion options embedded in our convertible debt are considered to be indexed to our stock and  as a result  we are not required to bifurcate the option from the note payable and mark the option to market each reporting period 
we are in the process of evaluating the provisions of eitf  which would take effect prospectively in the first quarter of  but at this time do not believe there will be a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
there would be no effect on our cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our holdings of financial instruments are comprised of debt securities and time deposits 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
apart from custodial accounts related to the executive deferred compensation plan  we do not invest in portfolio equity securities 
we do not invest in commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we manage these funds accordingly 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings also are exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers the majority of which are rated a or better 
we typically invest the majority of our investments in the shorter end of the maturity spectrum 
the table below presents the amortized cost  fair value and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our available for sale securities as of december  excluding primarily those related to our executive deferred compensation plan in thousands 
total fair value fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate our outstanding convertible notes have fixed interest rates 
accordingly the fair values of the respective issuances will fluctuate as market rates of interest move up or down 
fair values are also affected by changes in the price of our common stock 
our convertible senior unsecured notes in the principal amount of million at december  are due june  and have a fair value of million at december
