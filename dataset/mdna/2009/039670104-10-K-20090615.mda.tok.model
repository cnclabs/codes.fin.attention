item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive level overview fiscal net sales decreased to million from million in fiscal the fiscal net loss was million or per diluted share compared to a net loss of million or per diluted share in fiscal the company s fiscal results included a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  or a loss per diluted share  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
the non cash goodwill impairment charge has no impact on arctic cat s cash flow or liquidity 
the decrease in net sales and net earnings was mainly due to decreased sales of atvs caused by challenging retail market conditions for atv sales partially offset by increased snowmobile sales 
contributing to the snowmobile sales growth were innovative new products  lower north american dealer inventories and increased international sales 
the company ended the fiscal year with million in cash and short term investments 
the retail sales climate for all our products remained difficult in due to the severe contraction of the us economy which began in the last half of and continued throughout dramatically lower consumer spending as well as historically low consumer confidence and rising unemployment all contributed to industrywide weak retail demand 
north american industrywide retail sales of snowmobiles decreased for the full year compared to the prior model year 
industrywide sales in the united states were down nearly while snowmobile retail sales in canada actually increased slightly 
by comparison  arctic cat s north american retail sales outperformed the industry and the company gained a point of market share 
while the us snowmobile retail sales decrease was significant  snowmobiles still outperformed all other recreational vehicle products during the snowmobile selling season 
this reflects the positive impact that normal snowfall has on snowmobile retail sales 
wholesale snowmobile unit shipments to north american dealers were up in this modest increase along with the reduction in dealer inventories  which the company accomplished in allowed north american dealer inventory to shrink another at the end of these reductions are a part of the company s plan to better match dealer inventories with retail demand to protect and improve the strength of the company s dealer network 
snowmobile sales to international distributors are made in us dollars 
as a result of a weakening of the currencies in the countries where we sell snowmobiles  particularly russia  the company expects to experience lower sales volumes for the upcoming year 
in addition  because of the ongoing weakness in the economy  as well as anemic consumer spending  low consumer confidence and high unemployment  north american dealer orders will also be down this year 
overall  the company expects snowmobile sales to be down to compared to north american atv retail sales continued a four year decline and ended the calendar year down more than 
however  arctic cat s atv retail sales outperformed the market slightly as a result of significantly higher sales in canada 
in response to the rapid and severe economic downturn which occurred during the second half of fiscal  the company decided to significantly lower atv production in the fiscal fourth quarter to better match retail demand and further shrink dealer inventory 
importantly  despite lower retail sales in fiscal  the company succeeded in reducing dealer inventories by compared to the prior year 
in view of the current north american economic environment  the company does not expect atv retail sales to improve over last year  although the company may see a slight uptick in the atv market by the end of fiscal if the economy begins to rebound 
as a result  the company expects atv sales to be down to compared to atv sales decreased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal atv net sales first surpassed snowmobile net sales in fiscal and are the company s largest product line  comprising of net sales in fiscal snowmobile sales increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal  primarily due to the planned reduction last fiscal year in snowmobile production to align dealer inventory with retail demand which the company did in snowmobiles comprised of the company s net sales in fiscal parts  garments and accessories sales decreased slightly in fiscal to million from million in fiscal parts  garments and accessories sales were of the company s net sales in fiscal the following discussions should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company reviewed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on the company s reported results 
these critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue and provides for estimated marketing and sales incentive costs when products are shipped to dealers and distributors pursuant to their order  the price is fixed and collection is reasonably assured 
the company has agreements with finance companies to repurchase products repossessed up to certain limits 
the company s financial exposure to repurchase products is limited to the difference between the amount paid to the finance company and the resale value of the repossessed products 
historically  the company has not incurred material losses as a result of repurchases nor has it provided a financial reserve for repurchases 
adverse changes in retail sales could cause this situation to change 
marketing and sales incentive costs the company provides for various marketing and sales incentive costs which are offered to its dealers and consumers at the later of when the revenue is recognized or when the marketing and sales incentive program is approved and communicated 
examples of these costs include dealer and consumer rebates  dealer floorplan financing assistance and other incentive and promotion programs 
adverse market conditions resulting in lower than expected retail sales or the matching of competitor programs could cause accrued marketing and incentive costs to materially increase if the company authorizes and communicates new programs to its dealers 
the company estimates marketing and sales incentive costs based on expected usage and historical experience 
the related marketing and sales incentive costs accrual as of march  and was million and million  respectively  and included in accrued marketing in the company s balance sheet 
the decrease in this accrual was a result of current announced and communicated marketing and sales incentive programs and retail market conditions 
historically  marketing and sales incentive program expenses have been within our expectations 
to the extent current experience differs with previous estimates the accrued liability for marketing and sales incentives is adjusted accordingly 
product warranties the company generally provides a limited warranty to the owner of snowmobiles for months from the date of consumer registration and for months on atvs 
the company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale based on historical rates and trends and makes subsequent adjustments to their estimate as actual claims become known or the amounts are determinable 
adverse changes in actual warranty costs compared to the company s initial estimates could cause accrued warranty costs to materially change 
the accrued warranty costs as of march  and was million and million  respectively 
historically  actual warranty costs have been within our expectations 
inventories our inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market  with cost based on a first in  first out basis 
we periodically assess inventories for obsolescence and potential excess 
this assessment is based primarily on assumptions and estimates regarding future production demands  anticipated changes in technology or design  historical and expected future sales patterns 
our inventories consist of materials and products that are subject to changes in our planned production of future snowmobile and atv products and competitive market conditions which may cause lower of cost or market adjustments to our finished goods inventory 
if market conditions or future demand are less favorable than our current expectations  additional inventory write downs or reserves may be required  which could have an adverse effect on our reported results in the period the adjustments are made 
inventory items that are identified as obsolete or excess are fully reserved on our balance sheet and are generally scrapped 
historically  inventory obsolescence and potential excess costs adjustments have been within our expectations 
product liability and litigation the company is subject to product liability claims and other litigation in the normal course of business 
the company insures for product liability claims although it retains a modest self insured retention accrual within the balance sheet caption insurance 
the estimated costs resulting from any losses over insured amounts are charged to operating expenses when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably determinable 
the company utilizes historical trends and other analysis to assist in determining the appropriate loss 
adverse changes in the final determination of product liability or other claims made against the company could have a material impact on the company s financial condition 
historically  actual product liability and litigation costs have been within our expectations 

table of contents stock based compensation the company recognizes stock based compensation based on certain assumption inputs within the black scholes model 
these assumption inputs are used to determine an estimated fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant and require subjective judgment 
the company accounts for stock based payment awards in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payments sfas r 
because employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the employee stock options 
management assesses the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of stock based compensation on a regular basis 
circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time  which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value determination 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of sfas r the amount of compensation expense associated with sfas r may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
liquidity and capital resources the seasonality of the company s snowmobile production cycle and the lead time between the commencement of snowmobile and atv production in the early spring and commencement of shipments late in the first quarter have resulted in significant fluctuations in the company s working capital requirements during the year 
the following table represents revenue and ending inventories by each of the quarters in the years ended march  and first second third fourth total atv snowmobile pg a total sales inventories atv snowmobile pg a total sales inventories as a result of the company s significant reduction in production due to weaker than expected wholesale and retail demand for atv units  the company s finished goods inventory balance decreased as of march  compared with march  fiscal year end atv unit inventory are all considered saleable and are expected to sell at a gross profit in the subsequent fiscal year although continued or further declines in the atv retail environment may require additional marketing and sales incentive campaigns that could negatively impact our gross margins 
historically  the company has financed its working capital requirements out of available cash balances at the beginning and end of the production cycle and with short term bank borrowings during the middle of the cycle 
the company believes current available cash and cash generated from operations together with working capital financing through its available line of credit  as it is expected to be amended  will provide sufficient funds to finance the company on a short and long term basis 
however  given the turmoil in the economy and banking sector  there can be no assurance that adequate working capital financing arrangements will remain available or that the costs and other terms of such new financing arrangements will not be significantly less favorable to the company than has historically been available 

table of contents cash and short term investments cash and short term investments decreased to  at march  from  at march  because of the fiscal net loss and decreased accounts payable 
the company s cash balances traditionally peak early in the fourth quarter and then decrease as working capital requirements increase when the company s snowmobile and spring atv production cycles begin 
the company s investment objectives are first  safety of principal and second  rate of return 
financing arrangements and cash flows the company operated in fiscal under a  secured bank credit agreement for the documentary and stand by letters of credit and for working capital purposes 
total working capital borrowings under the credit agreement were limited to  in november and december and  during the last three months of the fiscal year in line with the company s bank line needs 
this line of credit was extended in the amount of  to june   at which time  the company believes the line of credit will be renewed at acceptable terms and conditions 
the total letters of credit issued at march  were  of which  was issued to suzuki for engine and service parts purchases 
this line of credit was extended in the amount of  to june  and currently the company is negotiating an extension for the remainder of the fiscal year at acceptable borrowing limits 
the company has agreements with textron financial corporation tfc to provide snowmobile and atv floor plan financing for the company s north american dealers 
these agreements improve the company s liquidity by financing dealer purchases of products without requiring substantial use of the company s working capital 
the company is paid by the floorplan companies shortly after shipment and as part of its marketing programs the company pays the floorplan financing of its dealers for certain set time periods depending on the size of a dealer s order 
the company s agreements with tfc to floorplan its us dealers terminates january  and its canadian agreement terminates april  on december   textron announced plans to exit the non captive dealer floorplan business 
while the company anticipates securing another dealer floorplan source for its dealers at acceptable terms and conditions before the termination of its agreements with tfc  there can be no assurance that an alternative source will be secured before termination of its agreements with tfc or that the costs and other terms of such new financing source will not be significantly less favorable to the company than has historically been available 
the financing agreements require repurchase of repossessed new and unused units and set limits upon the company s potential liability for annual repurchases 
the aggregate potential liability was approximately  at march  the company has incurred no material losses under these agreements 
the company believes current available cash and cash generated from operations provide sufficient funding in the event there is a requirement to perform under this guarantee and repurchase agreement 
in  the company invested  in capital expenditures 
the company expects that capital expenditures will increase to approximately  in fiscal since  the company has repurchased over million shares of common stock 
there is approximately  remaining on the january repurchase authorization 
the company believes that cash generated from operations and available cash will be sufficient to meet its working capital  and capital expenditure requirements on a short and long term basis
