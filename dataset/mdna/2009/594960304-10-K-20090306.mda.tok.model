item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are developing miniature display and imaging engines based upon our technology platform 
our technology platform utilizes our expertise in two dimensional micro electrical mechanical systems mems  lasers  optics and electronics to create a high quality video or still image from a small form factor device with lower power needs than conventional display technologies 
in  we announced our strategy to develop and supply a proprietary display engine called picop to potential original equipment manufacturing oem customers who will embed them into a variety of consumer and automotive products 
the primary objective for consumer applications is to provide users of mobile devices with a large screen viewing experience produced by a small embedded projector 
mobile devices may include cell phones  pda s  gaming consoles and other consumer electronics products 
these potential products would allow users to watch movies  play videos  display images  and other data onto a variety of surfaces 
the picop with some modification could be embedded into the dashboard of an automobile or an airplane or integrated into a portable aftermarket device to create a head up display hud that could project point by point navigation  critical operational  safety and other information important to the driver or pilot 
the picop could be further modified to be embedded into a pair of glasses to provide the mobile user with a see through or occluded personal display to view movies  play games or access other content 
we have incurred substantial losses since inception and expect to incur a substantial loss during the fiscal year ending december  key accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  contract losses  bad debts  investments and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the display and image capture industries  information provided by our current and prospective customers and strategic partners  information available from other outside sources  and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following key accounting policies require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize contract revenue as work progresses on long term  cost plus fixed fee  and fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
our revenue contracts generally include a statement of the work we are to complete and the total fee we will earn from the contract 
when we begin work on the contract and at the end of each accounting period  we work with the members of our technical team to estimate the labor and material and other cost required to complete the statement of work compared to cost incurred to date 
we use information provided by project mangers  vendors  outside consultants and others as we deem necessary to develop our cost estimates 
since our contracts generally require some level of technology development to complete  the actual cost required to complete a statement of work can vary from our estimated cost to complete 
we have developed processes that allow us to make reasonable estimates of the cost to complete a contract 
historically  we have made only immaterial revisions in the estimates to complete the contract at each reporting period 
recognized revenues are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion and actual revenue and cost become certain 
revisions in revenue estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
in the future  revisions in these estimates could significantly impact recognized revenue in any one reporting period 
if the us government cancels a contract  we would receive payment for work performed and costs committed to prior to the cancellation 
our product sales generally include acceptance provisions 
we recognize revenue for product shipments upon acceptance of the product by the customer or expiration of the contractual acceptance period 
losses on uncompleted contracts 
we establish an allowance for estimated losses if a contract has an estimated cost to complete that is in excess of the remaining contract value 
the entire estimated loss is recorded in the period in which the loss is first determined 
we determine the estimated cost to complete a contract through a detailed review of the work to be completed  the resources available to complete the work and the technical difficulty of the remaining work 
if the revised estimated cost to complete the contract is higher than the total contract revenue  the entire contract loss is recognized 
the actual cost to complete a contract can vary significantly from the estimated cost  due to a variety of factors including availability of technical staff  availability of materials and technical difficulties that arise during a project 
most of our development contracts are cost plus fixed fee type contracts 
under these types of contracts  we are not required to spend more than the contract value to complete the contracted work 
allowance for uncollectible receivables 
we maintain allowances for uncollectible receivables  including accounts receivable  cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and receivables from related parties 
we review several factors in determining the allowances including the customer s and related party s past payment history and financial condition 
if the financial condition of our customers or the related parties with whom we have receivables were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
inventory 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost basis 
we review several factors in determining the market value of our inventory including evaluating the replacement cost of the raw materials and the net realizable value of the finished goods 
if we do not achieve our targeted sales prices  if market conditions for our components or products were to decline or if we do not achieve our sales forecast  additional reductions in the carrying value of the inventory would be required 
investments available for sale and fair value measurements 
we account for investment securities in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities fas and fas no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas addresses the accounting and reporting for investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and for investments in debt securities 
fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
adopting fas on january  for financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
fas defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in its principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
fas establishes a three level fair value inputs hierarchy  and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable valuation inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
we utilize market data  assumptions and risks we believe market participants would use in measuring the fair value of the asset or liability  including the risks inherent in the inputs and the valuation techniques 
the hierarchy is summarized below 
level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not sufficiently active to qualify as level or  other observable inputs level unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data  which requires us to develop our own assumptions  which are significant to the measurement of the fair values estimating valuation inputs and selecting and applying valuation methods may require significant judgments by management 
changes in the estimated inputs and valuation methods could result in materially different values  credits and charges presented in the consolidated financial statements 
the investments are stated at fair value and classified as cash and cash equivalents or current investment securities available for sale on the consolidated balance sheets with unrealized gains and losses included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss 
we classify investment securities available for sale purchased with days or less remaining until contractual maturity as cash equivalents on the balance sheet in cash and cash equivalents 
interest income  realized gains and losses  and other than temporary impairments are recognized in the period earned or incurred  and presented separately in the consolidated statements of operations 
changes in the fair values of derivatives are realized in the period of remeasurement and recorded in gain loss on derivative instruments  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
employee share based compensation 
we issue share based compensation to employees in the form of options exercisable into our common stock and restricted or unrestricted shares of our common stock 
we account for employee share based compensation under the guidance provided by financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r  share based payment fas r 
the value of equity shares is determined using the fair value method  which is based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market on the date of grant 
the value of options is determined using the black scholes option pricing model with estimates of option lives  stock price volatilities and interest rates  then expensed over the periods of service allowing for pre vest forfeitures 
this widely accepted method results in reasonable option values and interperiod expense allocation  and comparability across companies 
changes in the estimated inputs or using other option valuation methods could result in materially different option values and share based compensation expense 
the key accounting policies described above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for us to apply judgment or make estimates 
there are also areas in which our judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result to our consolidated financial statements 
additional information about our accounting policies  and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles  are set forth in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
inflation has not had a material impact on our revenues  or income from continuing operations over the three most recent fiscal years 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  contract revenue 
of of contract contract revenue revenue change change in thousands government revenue   commercial revenue   total contract revenue   we earn contract revenue from performance on development contracts with the united states government and commercial customers 
our contract revenue in a particular period is dependent upon when we enter into a contract  the value of the contracts we have entered into  and the availability of technical resources to perform work on the contracts 
contract revenue from government contracts was substantially lower during than in due to reduced contract activity and lower beginning backlog in compared to the previous year 
we expect that we will have fewer opportunities to enter into new development contracts as we move closer to the commercialization of products based on our picop display engine 
as long as most of our revenue is earned from performance on development contracts  we believe there may be a high degree of variability in revenue from one period to another 
in december  we entered into a million contract with a commercial customer to develop prototype units based on our picop technology  for evaluation of future consumer electronics product applications 
the development work under this contract was initiated and fully completed in our backlog of development contracts at december  was  in government contracts and  in commercial contracts compared to million in government contracts and million in commercial contracts at december  the decrease in backlog from is primarily attributed to completion of government and commercial development contracts in and early we plan to complete the entire contract backlog during product revenue 
of of product product revenue revenue change change in thousands bar code revenue   nomad revenue total product revenue   bar code revenue includes the sales of rov and our discontinued flic bar code scanners 
the increase in bar code revenue for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due to the increased sales of our rov product line 
our quarterly revenue may vary substantially due to the timing of product orders from customers  production constraints and raw material availability 
the backlog of product orders at december  was approximately  compared to  at december   all of which is scheduled for delivery during cost of contract revenue 
of of contract contract revenue revenue change change in thousands cost of contract revenue   cost of contract revenue includes both the direct and allocated indirect costs of performing on development contracts 
direct costs include labor  materials and other costs incurred directly in performing on a contract 
indirect costs include labor and other costs associated with operating our research and development department and building our technical capabilities and capacity 
cost of contract revenue is determined both by the level of direct costs incurred on development contracts and by the level of indirect costs incurred in operating and building our technical capabilities and capacity 
both the direct and indirect costs can fluctuate substantially from period to period 
the cost of contract revenue as a percentage of revenue was lower in than in as a result of negotiating better terms on contracts and from the sale of prototype units that have been previously expensed to internally funded programs 
the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period  depending on the contract cost mix and the levels of direct and indirect costs incurred 
however  over longer periods of time we expect modest fluctuations in the cost of contract revenue  as a percentage of contract revenue 
cost of product revenue 
of of product product revenue revenue change change in thousands cost of product revenue   cost of product revenue includes both the direct and allocated indirect costs of manufacturing products sold to customers 
direct costs include labor  materials and other costs incurred directly in the manufacture of these products

our overhead  which includes the costs of procuring  inspecting and storing material  facility and depreciation costs  is allocated to inventory  cost of product revenue  cost of contract revenue  and research and development expense based on the proportion of direct material purchased for the respective activity 
during and  we expensed approximately  and  respectively  of manufacturing overhead associated with production capacity in excess of production requirements 
the increase in cost of product revenue for compared to was a result of increased revenue from the sales of rov and the increase in inventory write downs during the respective periods 
in  cost of product revenue included  of inventory write downs compared to  for the same period in the cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period  depending on the product mix  the level of overhead expense and the volume of direct materials purchased 
research and development expense 
change change in thousands research and development    research and development expense consists of compensation related costs of employees and contractors engaged in internal research and product development activities  laboratory operations  outsourced development and processing work  and other operating expenses 
in addition  we allocate our research and development resources based on the business opportunity of the available projects  the skill mix of the resources available and the contractual commitments we have made to customers 
in order to accelerate our time to market and because contract revenue was lower for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  we directed more of our research and development work to internally funded projects compared to the same period last year 
we have increased spending in research and development as part of our strategy to accelerate the time to market for products based on the picop 
the increase in cost is primarily attributable to increases in payroll costs and contracted services 
we believe that a substantial level of continuing research and development expense will be required to develop additional commercial products using the light scanning technology 
accordingly  we anticipate our level of research and development spending will continue to be substantial 
sales  marketing  general and administrative expense 
change change in thousands sales  marketing  general and administrative   sales  marketing  general and administrative expense includes compensation and support costs for marketing  sales  management and administrative staff  and for other general and administrative costs  including legal and accounting services  consultants and other operating expenses

based on the length of the historical duration of failed slars auctions and significant uncertainty of the prospective duration of inactivity and lack of liquidity in the slars market  we determined that the estimated fair values of the slars were less than par value and the impairments were other than temporary 
we used a discounted cash flow model  with rates adjusted for liquidity  to determine the estimated fair values of the slars as of december  we recorded an impairment of investment securities  available for sale of  for the period ended december  gain loss on derivative instruments  net

income taxes 
no provision for income taxes has been recorded because we have experienced net losses from inception through december  at december   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes 
in addition  we have research and development tax credits of million 
the net operating loss carry forwards and research and development credits available to offset future taxable income  if any  will expire in varying amounts from to if not previously utilized 
in certain circumstances  as specified in the internal revenue code  a or more ownership change by certain combinations of our shareholders during any three year period would result in a limitation on our ability to utilize a portion of our net operating loss carry forwards 
we have determined that such a change of ownership occurred during and that the annual utilization of loss carry forwards generated through the period of that change will be limited to approximately  an additional change of ownership occurred in and the annual limitation for losses generated in is approximately million 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no

commercial shipments of rov began during the fourth quarter of the decrease in bar code revenue in compared to was the result of the timing of the release of rov 
we believe that many of our customers were waiting for the availability of rov before placing orders for our bar code scanning products

the preferred stock terms included a dividend of per annum  payable quarterly in cash or registered common stock  at our election  subject to certain conditions 
the net cash proceeds of  were allocated to the preferred stock and the warrant based on the relative fair values of the securities 
the warrants were valued using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions expected volatility of  expected dividend yield of  risk free interest rate of  and contractual life of five years 
proceeds of million were allocated to the warrant and recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital 
subsequent to the relative fair value allocation  the effective conversion price of the convertible preferred stock was less than the closing price of our common stock on the date of commitment to purchase the preferred stock  resulting in the recognition of a beneficial conversion feature in accordance with eitf no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments 
this beneficial conversion feature was measured at million  which represents the difference between the fair value of the common stock and the effective conversion price 
the beneficial conversion feature was recorded as additional paid in capital and a deemed dividend to preferred stockholders 
it was amortized using the effective interest method over the three year stated life of the preferred stock 
during  we recorded  in dividends on the preferred stock and  in amortization of the beneficial conversion feature of the preferred stock 
in may  we entered into a conversion agreement with the holders of our preferred stock 
as consideration for converting  preferred shares  we issued a total of  shares of our common stock

there can be no assurance that additional cash will be available or that  if available  it will be available on terms acceptable to us on a timely basis 
if adequate funds are not available in the next several months to fully implement our plan we will begin to reduce the scope of our business to extend our operations as we pursue other financing opportunities and business relationships 
this reduction in scope could include delaying product launch and development projects resulting in reductions in staff  operating costs  capital expenditures and investment in research and development

should expenses exceed the amounts budgeted in our current operating plan  we may require additional cash earlier than expected to further the development of our technology  for expenses associated with product development  and to respond to competitive pressures or to meet unanticipated development difficulties 
our operating plan also provides for the development of strategic relationships with systems and equipment manufacturers that may require additional investments 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  it will be available on acceptable terms on a timely basis 
if adequate funds are not available to satisfy either short term or long term capital requirements or planned revenues are not generated  we may be required to limit our operations substantially 
this limitation of operations may include reductions in staff and discretionary costs  which may include non contractual research costs 
our cash requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the rate at which we can  directly or through arrangements with original equipment manufacturers  introduce products incorporating our technology and the market acceptance and competitive position of such products 
future operating expenditures and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the following the progress of research and development programs  the progress in commercialization activities and arrangements  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to establish cooperative development  joint venture and licensing arrangements 
in order to maintain our exclusive rights under our license agreement with the university of washington  we are obligated to make royalty payments to the university of washington with respect to the virtual retinal display technology 
if we are successful in establishing original equipment manufacturer co development and joint venture arrangements  we expect our partners to fund certain non recurring engineering costs for technology development and or for product development 
nevertheless  we expect our cash requirements to remain high as we expand our activities and operations with the objective of commercializing our light scanning technology 
the following table lists our contractual obligations in thousands payments d ue by period less than year years years more than years total contractual obligations open purchase obligations  minimum payments under capital leases minimum payments under operating leases  minimum payments under long term debt minimum payments under research  royalty and licensing agreements  total   open purchase obligations represent commitments to purchase inventory  materials  capital equipment  maintenance agreements and other goods used in the normal operation of our business 
license and royalty obligations continue through the lives of the underlying patents  which is currently through at least new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb released a fasb staff position  fsp fas determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  to clarify the application of the provisions of fas in an inactive market 
implementing of this standard upon its issuance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in february  the fasb released a fasb staff position  fsp fas effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delays the effective date of fas for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis to fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the financial impact of fsp fas on our financial statements 
in june  the eitf reached a final consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf 
eitf discusses how to determine whether an arrangement constitutes a collaborative arrangement  how costs incurred and revenue generated on sales to third parties should be reported by the participants  how an entity should characterize payments made between participants and what participants should disclose in the notes to the financial statements about a collaborative arrangement 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently assessing the financial impact of eitf on our financial statements 
subsequent events during january  we terminated employees or approximately of our workforce 
we will record an expense of approximately  related to the severance agreements for these employees in the first quarter of we accounted for the cost associated with the work force reduction in accordance with fas accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires that the liability for the costs associated with the exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market liquidity risks as of the end of  of our total cash  cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale have variable interest rates or are very short term discount notes traded in active markets 
therefore  we believe our exposure to the market and interest rate risk is not material 
the remaining is composed of million par student loan auction rate securities slars 
our slars are highly rated long term bonds and are structured with variable interest rate resets to be determined via a dutch auction process every days 
however  beginning in february as global credit markets deteriorated significantly  each auction has failed rendering the slars temporarily illiquid through the auction process and adverse credit market conditions have resulted in inactive secondary ars markets 
given the adverse credit market conditions  the fair value of the principal of these bonds has become affected by changes in interest rates  the spread between short and long rates  and credit market liquidity 
as a result  in the quarter ended september   we estimated that the fair value of our slars was approximately million and that the  adjustment was other than temporary 
if market conditions worsen  we may have to further adjust the estimated fair value of the slars  including additional charges to earnings if we believe the adjustment is other than temporary 
in the event we need access to the funds invested in the slars  we could be required to sell these securities at an amount below our original purchase value 
any of these events could affect our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
however  based on our current operating plan and ability to access our million held in cash and cash equivalents and other highly liquid investments held as of december   we do not expect to be required to sell these securities materially below their current estimated value 
our investment policy generally directs that the investment managers should select investments to achieve the following goals principal preservation  adequate liquidity and return 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents and investments available for sale securities portfolio are comprised of short term highly rated money market funds and commercial paper  and the slars 
the values of cash equivalents and investment securities  available for sale by maturity date as of december   are as follows rounding problem in table amount percent cash and cash equivalents  less than one year  one to two years greater than five years  foreign exchange rate risk all of our development contract payments are made in us dollars 
however  in the future we may enter into additional development contracts in foreign currencies that may subject us to foreign exchange rate risk 
we intend to enter into foreign currency hedges to offset material exposure to currency fluctuations when we can adequately determine the timing and amounts of the foreign currency exposure
