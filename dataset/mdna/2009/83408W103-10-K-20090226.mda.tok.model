for our online game business  we will leverage our success with tlbb and our game development platform to develop new mmorpgs  and expand and diversify our game offerings 
the chinese economy recently has experienced a slowing growth rate 
this slowdown has been exacerbated by the current global crisis in the financial services and credit markets  which has resulted in significant volatility and dislocation in the global capital markets 
it is uncertain how long the global crisis in the financial services and credit markets will continue and how much of an impact it will have on the global economy in general or on the chinese economy 
however we believe we are well positioned to weather the current economic downturn because of our status in the industry and our financial flexibility 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe accounting for brand advertising and sponsored search revenues  accounting for online game revenues  accounting for wireless revenues and cost of revenues  gross versus net basis of revenue recognition  determination of functional currencies  allowance for doubtful accounts  assessment of impairment for goodwill  intangible assets  fixed assets and other assets  determination of share based compensation expense  and income taxes and valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  represent critical accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition advertising revenues advertising revenues include revenue from brand advertising and sponsored search services  after deducting agent rebates and applicable business tax 
revenue from barter transactions  other than advertising for advertising barter transactions  is recognized based on the fair value of the nonmonetary assets acquired and the assets surrendered to obtain it 
no revenues from advertising for advertising barter transactions were recognized 

table of contents brand advertising contracts establish the fixed price and advertising services to be provided 
pursuant to brand advertising contracts  we provide advertisement placements on various website channels and in different formats  including but not limited to banners  links  logos  buttons  rich media and content integration 
revenue is recognized ratably over the period the advertising is provided and  as such  we consider the services to have been delivered 
we treat all elements of advertising contracts as a single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
based upon our credit assessments of our customers prior to entering into contracts  we determine if collectability is reasonably assured 
in situations where collectability is not deemed to be reasonably assured  we recognize revenue upon receipt of cash from customers  only after services have been provided and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
sponsorship contracts may include services similar to those in our brand advertising contracts  are generally for larger dollar amounts and for a longer period of time  may allow advertisers to sponsor a particular area on our websites  may include brand affiliation services and or a larger volume of services  and may require some exclusivity or premiere placements 
sponsorship advertisement revenues are normally recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period  provided we are meeting our obligations under the contract 
pursuant to sponsored search contracts  which are normally for relatively small dollar amounts and are with small and medium sized enterprises  sponsored search services mainly include priority placements in our search directory and pay for click services consisting of displaying the text based links of our advertisers on our websites and our website alliance network 
we normally provide priority placements services for a fixed fee over the service period of the contracts 
revenues on priority placements are normally recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period provided we are meeting our obligation under the contract 
pay for click services of displaying the text based links to our advertisers websites are charged on a cost per click basis  so that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on the displayed link 
the priority of the display of text based links is based on the bidding price of different advertisers 
revenues from the pay for click services are recognized as the users click on the links 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of our advertising revenues for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
non advertising revenues non advertising revenues include revenues principally from online game and wireless services 
online game revenues from our current mmorpg operations in china are earned by providing online services to game players pursuant to the item based revenue model 
for periods prior to our upgrading and re launching of bo in december  we operated bo under the time based revenue model  where game players are charged based on the time they spend playing the game 
under the item based revenue model  game players play games free of charge and are charged for purchases of virtual items 
online game revenues are collected through sale of our prepaid game cards 
we sell virtual and physical prepaid game cards to regional distributors  who in turn sub distribute to retail outlets  including internet caf s  various websites  news stands  software stores  book stores and retail stores 
we typically collect payment from our distributors upon delivery of our prepaid game cards 
under both the item based and the time based revenue models  proceeds received from sales of prepaid cards are initially recorded as receipts in advance 
for the item based revenue model  revenue is recognized over the estimated lives of the virtual items purchased or as the virtual items are consumed 
for the time based revenue model  revenue is recognized based upon the actual usage of time units by the game players 
the revenues are recorded net of business tax  sales discounts and rebates to our distributors 
under our item based revenue model  game players can access our games free of charge  but may purchase consumable virtual items  including those with a pre determined expiration time  such as three months  or perpetual items  such as certain costumes that remain bound to a game player for the life of the game 
revenues in relation to consumable virtual items are recognized as they are consumed  as our services in connection with these items have been fully rendered to our game players as of that time 
revenues in relation to perpetual virtual items are recognized over their estimated lives 
we will provide continual online game services in connection with these perpetual virtual items until they are no longer used by our game players 
we have considered the average period that game players typically play our games and other game player behavior patterns to arrive at our best estimates for the lives of these perpetual virtual items 
we have also considered that the estimated lives of perpetual virtual items may be affected by various factors  including the acceptance and popularity of expansion packs  promotional events launched and market conditions 
however  given the relatively short operating history of our games  and of our most popular game tlbb in particular  our estimate of the period that game players typically play our games may not accurately reflect the estimated lives of the perpetual virtual items 
we have adopted a policy of assessing the estimated lives of perpetual virtual items on a quarterly basis 
all paying users data collected since the launch of the games are used to perform the relevant assessments 
historical behavior patterns of these paying users during the period between their first log on date and last log on date are used to estimate the lives of perpetual virtual items 
while we believe our estimates to be reasonable based on available game player information  we may revise such estimates in the future as our games operation periods become longer and we continue to gain more operating history and data 
any adjustments arising from changes in 
table of contents the estimates of the lives of the virtual items would be applied prospectively on the basis that such changes are caused by new information indicating a change in the game player behavior patterns 
any changes in our estimate of lives of perpetual virtual items may result in our revenues being recognized on a basis different from prior periods and may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
prepaid game cards will expire two years after the date of card production if they have never been activated 
the proceeds from the expired game cards are recognized as revenue upon expiration of cards 
in contrast  once the prepaid game cards are activated and credited to a player s personal game account  they will not expire as long as the personal game account remains active 
we are entitled to suspend and close a player s personal game account if it has been inactive for a period of consecutive days 
the unused balances in an inactive player s personal game account are recognized as revenues when the account is suspended and closed 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized revenues in connection with expired un activated prepaid game cards and unused balances of activated prepaid game cards in an inactive account amounting to approximately  and  and  respectively 
we also derive online game revenues from licensing our games in other countries and territories 
these licensing agreements provided for two revenue streams  namely an initial license fee and a monthly revenue based royalty fee based on monthly revenues from the games and sales from ancillary products of the games 
the initial license fee is based on both a fixed amount and additional amount receivable upon achieving certain sales targets 
since we are obligated to provide post sales services such as technical support and provision of updates and when and if available upgrades to the licensees during the license period  the initial license fee from licensing arrangement is recognized as revenue ratably over the license period 
the fixed amount of the initial license fee is recognized ratably over the remaining license period from the launch of the game  and the additional amount is recognized ratably over the remaining license period from the date such additional amount is certain 
the monthly revenue based royalty fee is recognized when earned  provided that collectability is reasonably assured 
wireless revenues are derived from providing sms  rbt  wap  mms and ivr  mainly consisting of news  weather forecast  chatting  entertainment information  ring tones  and logo downloads and various other mobile related products provided to mobile phone users 
wireless service fees are charged on a monthly or per message download basis 
wireless revenues and cost of revenues are recognized in the month in which the service is performed  provided no significant obligations remain 
we rely on mobile network operators in china to bill mobile phone users for wireless service fees 
in order to meet ownership requirements under prc law which restrict or prohibit wholly foreign owned enterprises from providing internet information and value added telecommunication services such as wireless  we rely on sohu internet and goodfeel to contract with the mobile network operators 
generally  i within to days after the end of each month  sohu internet or goodfeel receives statements from each of the operators confirming the amount of wireless service charges billed to that operator s mobile phone users and ii within to days after delivering monthly statements  each operator remits the wireless service fees  net of its service fees  for the month to sohu internet or goodfeel 
in order to recognize revenue and be paid for services provided  we rely on billing confirmations from the mobile network operators as to the actual amount of services they have billed to their mobile customers 
we are unable to collect certain wireless services fees from an operator in certain circumstances due to technical issues with the operator s network 
this is referred to as the failure rate  which can vary from operator to operator 
at the end of each reporting period  where an operator has not provided sohu internet or goodfeel with the monthly statements for any month confirming the amount of wireless service charges billed to that operator s mobile phone users for the month  we  using information generated from our own internal system and historical data  make estimates of the failure rate and collectable wireless service fees and accrue revenues accordingly 
the quarterly historical differences in our estimated revenues which were recorded in the financial statements compared to the actual revenue have ranged from an underestimation of  gross margin underestimate of  to an overestimation of  gross margin overestimate of  since when wireless revenues began representing a significant portion of our total revenues 
we believe we have the ability to make a reasonable estimate 
however  differences between the actual failure rate and bad debt rate per an operator s statement and our internal estimates could result in material differences in the amount and timing of our revenue and cost of non advertising revenue for any period 
for the three months ended december   of our estimated wireless revenues were confirmed by the monthly statements received from the mobile network operators 
our management must determine whether to record our wireless revenues using the gross or net method of reporting 
determining whether revenue should be reported gross or net is based on an assessment of various factors  the primary factor is whether we are acting as the principal in offering services to the customer or whether we are acting as an agent in the transaction 
to the extent we are acting as a principal in a transaction  we report as revenue the payments received on a gross basis  and report as costs of revenue the amounts attributable to services provided by mobile network operators and other vendors 
to the extent we are acting as an agent in a transaction  we report on a net basis as revenue the payments received less commission and other payments to third parties 
whether we are serving as principal or agent in a transaction is judgmental in nature and is determined by evaluating terms of the arrangement 
based on our assessment  the majority of our wireless revenues are recorded on a gross basis 
we have primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the wireless services 
the content and nature of the wireless services are designed and developed by us either independently or with third parties and are originate from our websites  our links located on third parties websites  or one of our dedicated phone numbers 
the mobile network operators that we contract with to deliver these services to the end customers are not involved in the design or development of the services that are provided by us 
the end customers purchase the wireless 
table of contents content  community access or value added services  such as news  weather forecast  chatting  entertainment information  ring tones  and logo downloads and various other mobile related products provided to mobile phone users 
the end customers receive identical services from us regardless of which mobile network operator is used to deliver the message 
in addition  we provide customer services to the end customers directly and we could be requested by the mobile network operators to assume the credit risk if the operators are not able to collect fees from the end customers 
we have determined that in addition to the indicators of gross reporting  there are also certain indicators of net reporting  including the fact that the mobile network operators set maximum prices that we can charge and that the mobile network operators also have the right to set requirements and procedures associated with using their platform 
however  we have determined that the gross revenue reporting indicators are stronger  because we are the primary obligor  who adds value to the products 
we also have inventory risk related to content and products  and have reasonable pricing latitude 
to the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis  any commissions or other payments to third parties are recorded as costs or expenses so that the net amount gross revenues  less costs and expenses flows through to operating income 
accordingly  the impact on operating income is the same whether we record the revenue on a gross or on a net basis 
functional currency the functional currency of our subsidiaries and vies in china is the rmb and the functional currency of our subsidiaries outside china is the us dollar 
an entity s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates  normally  that is the currency of the environment in which it primarily generates and expends cash 
management s judgment is essential to determine the functional currency by assessing various indicators  such as cash flows  sales price and market  expenses  financing and inter company transactions and arrangements 
assets and liabilities of the china subsidiaries and vies are translated into us dollar  our reporting currency  at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date 
foreign currency translation adjustments are not included in determining net income for the period but are accumulated in a separate component of consolidated equity on the balance sheet 
the accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment as of december  and december  was a gain of million and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable our management must make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our gross accounts receivable balance was million  with an allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  if the financial condition of sohu s customers or mobile network operators were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  or the mobile network operators request us to assume additional bad debts as a result of the operators inability to collect fees from end customers  additional allowance might be required 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets include goodwill  intangible assets  fixed assets and other assets 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment on an annual basis  and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying value 
application of a goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
any impairment losses recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   there was no impairment loss in goodwill 
in respect of our intangible assets  which mainly comprise domain names  trademarks  customer lists and computer software purchased from unrelated third parties  we amortize the costs over their expected future economic lives 
fixed assets comprise office buildings  investment properties  computer equipment and hardware  office furniture  vehicles and leasehold improvements  and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets on a straight line basis 
other assets mainly include prepaid content fees  prepaid license fees and rental deposits 
we amortize the content fees and license fees over the terms of the contracts 
management s judgment is required to assess the economic lives of intangible assets and useful lives of the fixed assets and other assets 
based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangible assets  fixed assets and other assets based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management which is commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
an impairment charge would be recorded if we determined that the carrying value of intangible assets  fixed assets or other assets may not be recoverable 
our estimates of future cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many factors 
as of december   there was no impairment loss of our intangible assets  fixed assets and other assets 
share based compensation our financial statements reflect the adoption as of january   of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  which requires all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of employee share options and restricted share units  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values at grant date 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new share based awards  to share based awards granted to employees and directors before the adoption of sfas r whose related requisite services had not yet been provided  and to share based awards 
table of contents which were subsequently modified or cancelled 
in march  the united states securities and exchange commission  or the sec  issued staff accounting bulletin  or sab  regarding the sec s interpretation of sfas r and the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
we applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
our share based payments for periods prior to january  were accounted for in accordance with apb  and complied with the disclosure provisions of sfas in general  share based compensation expense under apb was recognized based on the difference  if any  between the estimated fair value of our common stock and the amount an employee was required to pay to acquire the stock  as determined on the date the option was granted 
pro forma information was disclosed to illustrate the effect on net income and net income per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas to share based employee compensation for the reporting periods 
under sfas r  we apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of options granted to employees and directors 
under the transition provisions of sfas r  we recognized compensation expense on options granted prior to the adoption of sfas r on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period  which is consistent with the methods we used when preparing pro forma information under sfas restricted share units are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying shares on the grant dates 
we recognize the relevant share based compensation expenses on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period 
under sfas r  the number of share based awards for which the service is not expected to be rendered for the requisite period should be estimated  and the related compensation expense not recorded for that number of awards 
for pro forma disclosure under sfas  we accounted for the effect of forfeitures only as the forfeitures occurred 
we applied the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated prior years results 
our assumptions were based on historical experience  with consideration to developing expectations about the future 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards and related share based compensation expenses represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change or different assumptions are used our share based compensation expense could be materially different for any period 
income taxes and valuation allowance against deferred tax assets we estimate income tax expense in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate for each period presented  including estimating current tax exposure as well as assessing realizable deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities 

table of contents as of december   our deferred tax assets are related to net operating losses of the holding company that would be subject to income taxes in the united states  and net operating losses and temporary differences between accounting and tax bases for our china based subsidiaries and vies 
as substantially all of our income is earned through subsidiaries outside the united states  and we do not intend in the foreseeable future to repatriate this income to the united states where it would be taxable  it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets resulting from these net operating losses of the holding company will not be realized 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets in order to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
if events were to occur in the future that would allow us to realize more of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount  an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax assets that would increase income for the period when those events occurred 
if events were to occur in the future that would require us to realize less of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount  an adjustment would be made to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that would decrease income for the period when those events occurred 
significant management judgment is required to determine income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities 
results of operations in order to focus on our core business of online advertising  on june   we discontinued our unprofitable e commerce business 
as a result of the discontinuation of this business  the e commerce business is accounted for as a discontinued operation

com inc share awards recognized in the consolidated income statements during the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested options and restricted stock units 
changyou share awards in march  sohu formed an indirect subsidiary  beijing fire fox  to carry out game development  and granted to an employee a contingent right to receive a payment equal to of the value of beijing fire fox upon the occurrence of certain events 
as the substance of this arrangement is similar to the grant of an option  this arrangement was accounted for as share based compensation under apb the amount of compensation to be recorded is based upon the intrinsic value on the grant date  which was determined based on its fair market value 
as of the date of grant  the intrinsic value was determined to be zero 
we later agreed with the employee that his contingent right in beijing fire fox would be modified to provide to the employee an equity interest in changyou  a subsidiary set up to own and operate our online game business  in lieu of the contingent right 
in january  sohu communicated to and agreed with the employee that the equity interest granted to him consisted of  ordinary shares and  restricted shares in changyou  which represent approximately and of the fully diluted equity interest of changyou 
the restricted shares included  as a condition of vesting  the completion of an initial public offering by changyou on an internationally recognized stock exchange  and also were subject to a vesting schedule 
in addition  the employee will not be entitled to participate in any distributions by changyou  on his ordinary shares and restricted shares  until the earlier of its completion of an initial public offering or february in april  changyou modified the vesting conditions of the restricted shares to provide for vesting over a four year period commencing on february   with no condition that an initial public offering be completed 
the difference between the fair values  or the incremental fair value  of the  ordinary shares and  restricted shares granted to the employee and his contingent right in beijing fire fox was accounted for as share based compensation 
because the terms of the issuance of the ordinary shares and restricted shares had been approved and were communicated to and agreed with the employee as of january   this was considered the grant date under us gaap and  accordingly  the incremental fair value was determined as of that date 
the portion of the incremental fair value related to the  ordinary shares  equal to million  was recognized as share based compensation expense in product development expenses for the three months ended march  as result of the modification of the vesting terms of the  restricted shares in april  the portion of the incremental fair value related to those shares  equal to million  was determined as of that date and is accounted for as share based compensation over the vesting period starting from the date of the modification  following the accelerated basis of attribution 
share based compensation expense relating to the  restricted shares for the year ended december  was million and recognized in product development expenses 
the incremental fair values were determined using the discounted cash flow method 
in april  sohu approved and communicated to other employees of changyou the grants of an aggregate of  restricted shares and  restricted share units of changyou  which are settleable in changyou s ordinary shares upon vesting 
these restricted shares and restricted share units are subject to vesting over a four year period commencing february  and are subject to a completion of an initial public offering of changyou 
the grant date fair value of the awards will be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations starting from the date when those vesting conditions become probable 
the total share based compensation in related to changyou share awards recognized in the consolidated income statements during the years ended december   and were million  nil and nil  respectively 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted shares and restricted share units of changyou granted to the aforementioned employees of changyou 
we determined the fair values of the ordinary shares of one of our subsidiaries  changyou  as of the january and april grant dates  relying in part on a report prepared by a qualified professional appraiser  and determining the fair value required us to make complex and subjective judgments regarding its projected financial and operating results  its unique business risks  the liquidity of its ordinary shares and its operating history and prospects at the time the grants were made 
because at the time of the grants our mmorpg business was at a different stage of its product life cycle than that of the publicly listed companies in the online game industry  we concluded that a market comparison approach would not have been meaningful in determining the fair value of changyou s ordinary shares 
as a result  we and the professional appraiser used the income approach discounted cash flow method to derive the fair values 
we applied the discounted cash flow  or dcf  analysis based on its projected cash flow using management s best estimate as of the respective valuation dates 
the projected cash flow estimate included  among other things  an analysis of projected revenue growth  gross margins  effective tax rates  capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
the income approach involves applying appropriate discount rates  based on earnings forecasts  to estimated cash flows 
the assumptions we used in deriving the fair value of its ordinary shares were consistent with the assumptions used in developing our online game business plan  which included no material changes in the existing political  legal  fiscal and economic conditions in china  our ability to recruit and retain competent management  key personnel and technical staff to support our ongoing operations  and no material deviation in industry trends and market conditions from economic forecasts 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and subjective 
the discount rates reflect the risks our management perceived as being associated with achieving the forecasts and are based on our estimated cost of capital  which was derived by using the capital asset pricing model  after taking into account systemic risks and company specific risks 
the capital asset pricing model is a model for pricing securities that adds an assumed risk premium rate of return to an assumed risk free rate of return 
using this method  we determined the appropriate discount rates to be as of the january valuation date and as of the april valuation date 
we also applied a discount for lack of marketability  or dlom  to reflect the fact that  at the time of the grants  changyou was a closely held company and there was no public market for its ordinary shares 
to determine the discount for lack of marketability  we and the professional appraiser used the black scholes option pricing model 
pursuant to the black scholes option pricing model  we used the cost of a put option  which can be used to hedge the price change before a privately held share can be sold  as the basis to determine the discount for lack of marketability 
based on the foregoing analysis  we used a dlom of to discount the value of changyou ordinary share as of the january and april valuation dates 
because there was no evidence to indicate that there would be a disproportionate return between majority and minority shareholders  we did not apply a minority discount

sfas applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  however  on february   the fasb issued fsp fas  which would delay the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this fsp partially defers the effective date of statement to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
we believe there will be no material impact on our financial statements upon adoption of this standard

table of contents liquidity and capital resources for the three years ended december   we financed our operations primarily through cash flows from operations 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents  and investments in marketable debt securities totaling approximately million  compared to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   approximately million of earnings held by our foreign subsidiaries are designated as infinitely reinvested outside the united states 
if dividends are paid by our china or other non us subsidiaries to sohu 
com inc  the dividends would be taxed at sohu 
com inc s rate of taxation  which is or as reduced by any applicable deemed paid foreign tax credits for foreign income taxes paid by such subsidiaries 
for the foreseeable future  we do not intend for the china or other non us subsidiaries to pay dividends to sohu 
com inc in october   the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to million of sohu s outstanding shares of common stock until the end of during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased  shares in the open market  at an average price of for a total consideration of million 
we expect to continue to execute this program during the year ending december  we completed a private placement on july  of million principal amount of zero coupon convertible senior notes due july  which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million after deduction of the initial purchaser s discount and our offering expenses 
the notes did not pay any interest  had a zero yield to maturity  and were convertible into sohu s common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment for dividends  distributions  and upon the occurrence of certain other events 
each  principal of the notes was initially convertible into shares of sohu s common stock 
each holder of the notes had the right  at the holder s option  to require sohu to repurchase all or any portion of the principal amount of the holder s notes on july in  and at a price equal to of the outstanding principal amount 
sohu had the right to redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at any time on or after july  at of the principal amount of the notes if the closing price of sohu s common stock for each of the consecutive trading days prior to such time was at least of the conversion price or at such time at least of the initial aggregate principal amount of the notes had been converted  repurchased or redeemed 
in addition  upon a change of control event  each holder of the notes could require sohu to repurchase some or all of its notes at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes 
during the year ended december   we redeemed a portion of our zero coupon convertible senior notes with face value of  at a discount 
during the year ended december   we redeemed a portion of our zero coupon convertible senior notes at a discount for  in aggregate face value 
as of the end of the notification period associated with the july  repurchase date  note holders had exercised their right to require us to repurchase such notes in an aggregate principal amount of million 
we repurchased such notes on july  in november  the majority of remaining note holders with  in face amount of convertible notes exercised their right to convert their notes to our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
during the year ended december   the remaining  of zero coupon convertible senior notes were redeemed  therefore the outstanding balance was zero as of december  our principal commitments consist of obligations under various operating leases for office facilities in beijing  shanghai  guangzhou and hong kong 
our commitments under these leases total approximately million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
we expect that capital expenditures  totaling million in will consist of million for purchases of servers  network equipment and software and million for miscellaneous purchases 
we have entered into arrangements with dr 
zhang  our chief executive officer  and certain of our employees to satisfy prc regulations which prohibit or restrict foreign companies from owning or operating telecommunications  internet content and certain other businesses in china 
these arrangements have taken the form of loans to dr 
zhang and the employees  who then invested the amounts loaned in what are currently our vies 
while the arrangements have taken the form of loans to dr 
zhang and the employees  they are  in substance  investments in the vies 
accordingly  we do not expect the loans to have any special effect upon our liquidity 
the loan agreements do not contain any material financial covenants 
the chinese economy recently has experienced a slowing growth rate 
this slowdown has been exacerbated by the current global crisis in the financial services and credit markets  which has resulted in significant volatility and dislocation of the global capital markets 
it is uncertain how long the global crisis in the financial services and credit markets will continue and how much of an impact it will have on the global economy in general or the chinese economy 
however we believe we are well positioned to weather the current economic downturn because of our status in the industry and our financial flexibility 
although our net cash provided by operating activities might be negatively affected by general economic conditions  we believe that we will continue to generate strong cash flow from our brand advertising and online game business  which  along with our available cash  will provide sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility 
we expect to rely on the cash we generate from our operations and our available cash to meet our obligations  support our operation and fund our capital expenditures over the next twelve months

we believe that current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital net cash used in operating activities  commitments and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we may  however  require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments 

table of contents tabular disclosure of contractual obligations in thousands the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations off balance sheet commitments and arrangements we have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of third parties 
we have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholder s equity  or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to such entity 
we do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit support to us or that engages in leasing  hedging or product development services with us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk while our reporting currency is the us dollar  to date the majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in rmb and a significant portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in rmb 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between us dollar and rmb 
if the rmb depreciates against the us dollar  the value of our rmb revenues and assets as expressed in our us dollar financial statements will decline 
we do not hold any derivative or other financial instruments that expose us to substantial market risk 
see risk factors we may suffer currency exchange losses if the rmb depreciates relative to the us dollar 
the rmb is currently freely convertible under the current account  which includes dividends  trade and service related foreign exchange transactions  but not under the capital account  which includes foreign direct investment 
in addition  commencing on july   china reformed its exchange rate regime by changing to a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies 
under the managed floating exchange rate regime  the rmb is no longer pegged to the us dollar 
the exchange rate of the rmb against the us dollar was adjusted to rmb per us dollar as of july   representing an appreciation of about 
the people s bank of china will announce the closing prices of foreign currencies such as the us dollar traded against the rmb in the inter bank foreign exchange market after the closing of the market on each business day  and will make such prices the central parity for trading against the rmb on the following business day 
on may   the people s bank of china announced a policy to expand the maximum daily floating range of rmb trading prices against the us dollar in the inter bank spot foreign exchange market from to 
while the international reactions to the rmb revaluation and widening of the rmb s daily trading band have generally been positive  with the increased floating range of the rmb s value against foreign currencies  the rmb may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the us dollar or other foreign currencies in the long term  depending on the fluctuation of the basket of currencies against which it is currently valued 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future  the effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure 
accordingly  we may incur economic losses in the future due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following table sets forth a summary of our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments as of december   which consisted of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash accounts  receivables  and accounts payables 
the maturity of those financial instruments was less than one year and their book value approximated fair value 

table of contents in thousands denominated in us rmb hk total cash and cash equivalents restricted cash accounts receivable accounts payable inflation rate risk according to the national bureau of statistics of china  the change in the consumer price index in china was  and in  and  respectively 
if inflation continues to rise  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
interest rate risk the basic objectives of our investment program are to protect the invested funds from excessive risk and to provide for liquidity that is sufficient to meet operating and investment cash requirements 
our investment policy limits our investments of excess cash in high quality corporate securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
during  we redeemed the remaining  zero coupon convertible senior notes  therefore we had no interest rate sensitive financial instrument as of december  we do not expect to be exposed to material risk due to changes in interest rates on borrowings in the foreseeable future
