overview we are a leading multi jurisdictional owner and operator of pari mutuel wagering properties and businesses 
additionally  we offer gaming products through our slot and video poker operations in louisiana 
during  we implemented a business realignment that more properly considers recent growth and changes in our business and redefined our four operating segments as follows racing operations  which includes churchill downs racetrack churchill downs in louisville  kentucky  an internationally known thoroughbred racing operation and home of the kentucky derby since  
table of contents arlington park racecourse arlington park  a thoroughbred racing operation in arlington heights along with ten off track betting facilities otbs in illinois  calder race course calder  a thoroughbred racing operation in miami gardens  florida  fair grounds race course fair grounds  a thoroughbred racing operation in new orleans along with ten otbs in louisiana 
on line business  which includes twinspires  an advance deposit wagering adw business that conducts pari mutuel wagering in states  bloodstock research information services bris bris  a data service provider for the equine industry  our equity investment in hrtv  llc hrtv a horseracing television channel 
gaming  which includes video services  inc vsi  the owner and operator of more than video poker machines in louisiana  fair grounds slots  a slot facility in louisiana which operates approximately slot machines 
other investments  which includes churchill downs simulcast productions  llc cdsp  a provider of television production to the racing industry  our other minor investments 
in order to evaluate the performance of these operating segments  we use net revenues and ebitda as key performance measures of the results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally 
furthermore  we believe that the use of these measures enables us and investors to evaluate and compare from period to period  our operating performance in a meaningful and consistent manner 
because we use ebitda as a key performance measure of financial performance  we are required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america to provide the information concerning ebitda 
however  these measures should not be considered as an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net earnings as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as a measure of our operating results or cash flows as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or as a measure of our liquidity 
during  we opened our permanent slot facility at fair grounds and closed the temporary slot facility  which had been in use since september the new facility initially includes approximately slot machines and three restaurants  further enhancing the entertainment and gaming experience at fair grounds 
during  the overall weakness in the us economy  particularly the turmoil in the credit markets  weakness in the housing market  and volatile energy and commodity costs  resulted in considerable negative pressure on consumer spending 
as a result  pari mutuel wagering and gaming businesses  which are driven  in part  by discretionary spending and industry competition  weakened and contributed to a decline in our pari mutuel handle of during the year ended december  compared to the same period of total handle for the pari mutuel industry  as published by the national thoroughbred racing association ntra  declined during the year ended december  compared to the same period of disputes with horsemen regarding purse levels related to slot and adw revenues limited our racing signal distribution and contributed to the decline in our pari mutuel handle 
we anticipate that discretionary spending will not improve  and will likely weaken further  until the current economic trends reverse course  particularly the expected weakness in the overall economy and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
we believe that  despite uncertain economic 
table of contents conditions  we are in a strong financial position 
as of december   there is million of borrowing capacity under our revolving loan facility  which matures september to date  we have not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity 
due to declines in business experienced within the racing operations operating segment attributable to disputes with horsemen as well as the impact of overall weakness in the us economy  we determined that a triggering event occurred during the fourth quarter of requiring impairment assessments of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets  property and equipment and definite lived intangible assets 
as a result  we completed impairment tests  which indicated no adjustments to the carrying values of the assets were required 
during  we sold our ownership interest in hoosier park 
we made the decision to sell hoosier park in order to dispose of an asset which we considered to be underperforming and to provide us with additional opportunities and resources to focus on our other assets and operations 
during  we sold all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock the stock of rca  the parent company of ellis park race course ellis park 
as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k  we do not anticipate further dispositions of our operations in our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the sold businesses discussed above have been accounted for as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k

horsemen s consent to distribute racing signals the thoroughbred horsemen s group llc the thg  an alliance of approximately eighteen horsemen s groups covering over racetracks  including fair grounds  arlington park  churchill downs and calder  has 
table of contents been appointed an agent on behalf of such horsemen s groups for the purpose of negotiating agreements with the company related to sharing revenues on adw as well as other activities 
the thg has previously expressed interest in negotiating an agreement with the company and its adw business  twinspires  to provide approximately one third of gross adw wagering commissions to horsemen s groups that they represent  which is significantly higher than amounts returned to horsemen s groups currently 
as a result of thg s position  the florida horsemen s benevolent and protective association  inc the fhbpa  the kentucky horsemen s benevolent and protective association  inc the khbpa and the kentucky thoroughbred association  inc the kta withheld their consent under the interstate horseracing act of the iha for the exporting of racing signals from churchill downs and calder to national adw businesses  including twinspires  during most of calder was precluded from exporting racing signals to any adw business except for the new york racing association s adw business  which operates on a limited basis outside the state of new york

legislative and regulatory changes federal wto in  the country of antigua filed a formal complaint against the united states with the world trade organization wto  challenging the united states ability to enforce certain federal gaming laws sections  and of title of the united states code known as the wire act  the travel act and the illegal gambling business act  respectively  and collectively the acts against foreign companies that were accepting internet wagers from united states residents 
at issue was whether the united states enforcement of the acts against foreign companies violated the general agreement on trade in services gats 
in november  a wto panel ruled that the united states  as a signatory of gats  could not enforce the acts against foreign companies that were accepting internet wagers from united states residents 
the united states appealed the ruling and  in april  the wto s appellate body ruled that the united states had demonstrated that the acts were measures necessary to protect public morals or maintain public order  but that the united states did not enforce the acts consistently between domestic companies and foreign companies as required by gats 
the wto s appellate body specifically referenced the iha  which appeared to authorize domestic companies to accept internet wagers on horse racing  as being inconsistent with the united states stated policy against internet wagering 
in arguments and briefs before the wto s appellate body  the united states argued that the acts  specifically the wire act  apply equally to domestic companies and foreign companies and the iha does not create an exception for domestic companies to accept internet wagering on horse racing 
the wto s appellate body did not rule on whether an exception for domestic us companies was created under the iha  but recommended that the wto s dispute settlement body request the united states to bring measures found to be inconsistent with gats into conformity with its obligations under gats 
the united states was given until april  to bring its policies in line with the ruling  assuming it believed any changes were necessary 
on april   the united states delegation to the wto submitted a brief report to the chairman of the dispute settlement body us report stating that no changes are necessary to bring us policies in line with the ruling 
in support of its position  the united states delegation informed the dispute settlement body that on april   the united states department of justice confirmed the united states government position regarding remote wagering on horse racing in testimony before a subcommittee of the united states house of representatives 
according to the us report  in that testimony  the department of justice stated its view that regardless of the iha  existing criminal statutes prohibit the interstate transmission of bets or wagers  including wagers on horse racing  and informed the subcommittee that it is currently undertaking a civil investigation relating to a potential violation of law regarding this activity 
on january   the wto compliance panel issued its interim finding in response to the us report and found that the united states has failed to comply with previous wto rulings regarding restrictions on access to the us internet gaming market 
on march   the final report was issued upholding all lower panel decisions 
on may   the united states trade representative the ustr announced that it had initiated the formal process by the united states of withdrawing its gats commitment to clarify an error that it had made in by including gambling services in its schedule of commitments 
the ustr stated that the united states will use the wto procedures for clarifying its commitments under the gats 
the ustr also stated that the united states intends to modify its services schedule by clearly defining gambling as an excluded commitment under the gats 
the result of withdrawal 
table of contents would be that the united states would not be obligated to provide foreign providers of gambling services access to the united states market 
under gats  countries seeking to alter their service trade commitments must compensate trading partners that may potentially be negatively impacted by the change 
at this time  the only remaining issue before the wto appears to be appropriate compensation to affected members of the treaty 
the us government has made offers of compensation to wto members affected by the decision of the us to rule out any market access commitments regarding cross border gambling services 
in december  the wto arbitrators awarded antigua the right to impose sanctions against united states intellectual property  including copyrights  trademarks and patents  up to an annual amount of million 
the arbitrators award is not subject to appeal under wto rules 
the ustr has made no specific statement regarding how this will impact interstate gambling in horse racing 
one of the options available to congress and the white house is to prohibit or restrict substantially the conduct of interstate simulcast wagering or account wagering 
if the us government elects to take such an approach including through any action by the department of justice  it will have a material  adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
other federal legislation regulation on october   president bush signed into law the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of uigea 
this act prohibits those involved in the business of betting or wagering from accepting any financial instrument  electronic or otherwise  for deposit that is intended to be utilized for unlawful internet gambling 
this act declares that nothing in the act may be construed to prohibit any activity allowed by the iha 
this act also contains a sense of congress  which explicitly states that it is not intended to criminalize any activity currently permitted by federal law 
the secretary of the treasury was directed to promulgate regulations to enforce the provisions of this act within days 
the secretary was further directed to ensure the regulations do not prohibit any activity which is excluded from the definition of unlawful internet gambling  including those activities legal under the iha 
on october   the treasury department published proposed rules and regulations that require us financial firms participating in designated payment systems to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent payments being made to gambling businesses in connection with unlawful internet gambling 
activities permitted under iha are specifically excluded from the definition of unlawful internet gambling 
comments on the proposed rules were filed by numerous parties through december  representatives of the horse racing industry encouraged regulations to mirror statutory languages protecting activities under the iha 
additionally  language was proposed requiring financial service providers to create a separate merchant code for activities under the iha 
the regulations are now final and will take effect on december  we continue to monitor potential legislative changes that will impact the regulations 
florida on january   miami dade voters approved a referendum permitting pari mutuel facilities  including calder  to operate up to  slot machines at each location 
under current state law  slot machine revenues are to be subject to a tax rate 
in  governor charlie crist approved a compact with the seminole tribe that would permit the tribe to operate certain table games and class iii slot machines in return for specified revenue to the state of florida 
the compact was voided by the florida supreme court  and legislators are now reviewing options to approve a new compact 
as part of those discussions  legislators are evaluating the tax rate on slot machine revenues and product offerings for south florida pari mutuel facilities  including calder 
at this point  it is too early to determine whether any modifications to the current regulatory system will be granted 
on august   the district court of appeals  first district  state of florida rendered a decision in the case of floridians against expanded gambling faeg  et 
al versus floridians for a level playing field  et 
al 
faeg challenged the process by which signatures were collected in order to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot in allowing miami dade and broward county voters to approve slot machines in pari mutuel facilities 
the district court of appeals reversed a decision of the florida trial court  which granted summary judgment and dismissed the challenge  and remanded the case back to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether sufficient signatures were collected in the petition process 
a motion for rehearing by the entire court of appeals or in the alternative a motion for certification to the florida supreme court was filed 

table of contents the case was re heard by the entire court of appeals and the panel s decision was upheld 
the question of law was certified to the florida supreme court  which initially accepted jurisdiction 
however  after oral arguments were made on september   the district court of appeals issued an opinion on september   which held the case was not properly put before the district court of appeals  and therefore upheld the lower court s decision to remand the case back to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether sufficient signatures were collected in the petition process 
the parties have agreed to a settlement of all pending claims and are preparing documents for a final order of dismissal by the court 
illinois pursuant to the illinois horse racing act  arlington park and all other illinois racetracks are permitted to receive a payment commonly known as purse recapture 
generally  in any year that wagering on illinois horse races at arlington park is less than of wagering both in illinois and at arlington park on illinois horse races in  arlington park is permitted to receive of the difference in wagering in the subsequent year 
the payment is funded from the arlington park purse account 
under the illinois horse racing act  the arlington park purse account is to be repaid via an appropriation by the illinois general assembly from the illinois general revenue fund 
however  this appropriation has not been made since subsequently  illinois horsemen unsuccessfully petitioned the illinois racing board irb to prevent illinois racetracks from receiving this payment in any year that the illinois general assembly did not appropriate the repayment to the racetrack s purse accounts from the general revenue fund 
further  the illinois horsemen filed lawsuits seeking  among other things  to block payment to illinois racetracks  as well as to recover the and amounts already paid to the illinois racetracks 
these lawsuits filed by the illinois horsemen challenging the and reimbursements have been resolved in favor of arlington park and the other illinois racetracks 
several bills were filed in the   and sessions of the illinois legislature that  in part  would eliminate the statutory right of arlington park and the other illinois racetracks to continue to receive this payment 
none of these bills passed 
since the statute remains in effect  arlington park continues to receive the recapture payment from the purse account 
if arlington park loses the statutory right to receive this payment  there would be a material  adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
under previously enacted legislation  the illinois horse racing equity fund was scheduled to receive a portion up to of adjusted gross receipts of wagering tax from the tenth riverboat casino license issued 
the funds are scheduled to be utilized for purses and track discretionary spending 
during december  the illinois gaming board awarded the tenth license to midwest gaming to operate a casino in des plaines  illinois 
this license may become operable as early as during the spring of session of the illinois general assembly  public act was passed to create and fund the horse racing equity trust fund 
the horse racing equity trust fund is to be funded from revenues of illinois riverboat casinos that meet a certain threshold 
sixty percent of the funds are to be used for horsemen s purses for thoroughbred meets and for standardbred meets 
the remaining is to be distributed to racetracks of that total for arlington park and is for improving  maintaining  marketing and operating arlington park and may be used for backstretch services and capital improvements 
public act expired on may  in an effort to prevent implementation of public act  the four illinois riverboat casinos that meet the threshold to contribute to the horse racing equity trust fund filed a complaint on may  in the circuit court of will county  illinois 
the complaint was filed against the state treasurer and the irb to enjoin the imposition and collection of the surcharge from the casinos  which was to be deposited in the horse racing equity trust fund 
the court ruled in april that the law was unconstitutional as the law only affects the four suburban casinos and not the five downstate casinos 
the attorney general filed an appeal of this ruling to the illinois supreme court 
the riverboats have been paying the monies into a special escrow account and have demanded that the monies not be distributed 
a temporary restraining order was granted to prevent distribution of these monies 
the complaint alleges that public act is unconstitutional 
the illinois supreme court reversed the decision of the circuit court 
however  the riverboat casinos have requested certiorari from the us supreme court and filed a petition to stay payment until final determination is made by that court 
the illinois

the session of the illinois legislature ended without enactment of legislation permitting expanded gaming at the racetrack 
legislation allowing slot machines at illinois racetracks and clarifying the legality of advance deposit wagering was introduced as part of a capital spending plan during but did not pass 
during january  february and a portion of march when there is no live racing in illinois  the irb designates a thoroughbred racetrack as the host track in illinois  for which the host track receives a higher percentage of earnings from pari mutuel activity throughout illinois 
the irb appointed arlington park the host track in illinois during january for days  which is an increase of eight days compared to the same period of arlington park s future designation as the host track is subject to the annual designation by the irb 
a change in the number of days that arlington park is designated host track could have a material  adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations

kentucky the session of the general assembly concluded april  the kentucky horse industry sought legal authority to offer alternative forms of gaming at kentucky s eight existing racetracks 
alternative forms of gaming would enable our kentucky racetrack to better compete with neighboring gaming venues by providing substantial new revenues for purses and capital improvements 
governor steve beshear supported this expansion and unveiled his plan on february   which would have permitted churchill downs to operate a casino in jefferson county  kentucky 
the legislation  which would have required a public referendum in the fall of  was ultimately unsuccessful

hb also stipulates a tax rate on gross gaming revenues during the first five years of operation and a tax rate for ensuing years if the facility exceeds million in gross gaming revenues per year 
at this time  it is too early to determine if hb will be successful 
on july   governor beshear created the task force on the future of horse racing and charged the panel to study the economic soundness of the industry  the effectiveness and quality of drug testing  the oversight role of the khrc and the adequacy of state laws and regulations 
the panel s report included numerous recommendations pertaining to industry financial matters  proper funding and staffing for the khrc  integrity of racing and pari mutuel activities and potential lab facilities 
hb would address some of the recommendations related to the industry financial matters 
additionally  house bill hb and house bill hb were filed to address other recommendations  most notably the proper funding of the khrc

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on our historical experience  contract terms  observance of known trends in our company and the industry as a whole and information available from other outside sources 
our estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period

we assign estimated useful lives to our definite lived intangible assets based on the period of time the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows 
we consider certain factors when assigning useful lives such as legal  regulatory  competition and other economic factors 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized using the straight line method 
while we believe that our estimates of future revenues and cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions could materially affect our assessment of useful lives and fair values 
changes in assumptions may cause modifications to our estimates for amortization or impairment  thereby impacting our results of operations 
if the estimated lives of our definite lived intangible assets were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above  amortization expense could increase significantly

the guarantors under the first amendment continue to be a majority of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries 
the first amendment primarily serves i to reduce the maximum aggregate commitment under the credit facility from million to million and ii to reduce the interest rates applicable to amounts borrowed under this facility 
given the reduction in the maximum aggregate commitment  four lenders that were originally parties to the agreement are removed as lenders under the terms of the first amendment

the first amendment also modifies two of the financial covenants  providing for a one time increase in the maximum leverage ratio for a period of eight consecutive quarters in the event that the company constructs a gaming and or slot facility in florida and increasing the baseline for the minimum consolidated net worth covenant from million to million

the long put option and short call option are included in other assets and other liabilities  respectively  and are both being amortized into earnings on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the note
