item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a diversified provider of outsourced services and specialty products 
we perform a wide range of manufacturing  engineering  design  testing and other technical services  typically under multi year  sole source contracts with major companies and government agencies in the markets for aerospace defense electronics  truck components assemblies  and test measurement services 
revenue from our three core markets accounted for approximately of our revenue for the year ended december   while revenue from our outsourced services accounted for approximately of our revenue 
we are organized into two business groups  the industrial group and the electronics group 
the industrial group is one reportable business segment  while the electronics group includes two reportable business segments  aerospace defense and test measurement 
the industrial group is comprised of sypris technologies  inc and its subsidiaries  which generates revenue primarily from the sale of manufacturing services to customers in the market for truck components assemblies and from the sale of products to the energy and chemical markets 
the aerospace defense reportable segment is comprised of sypris data systems  inc and sypris electronics  llc 
revenue for this group is derived primarily from the sale of manufacturing services  technical services and products to customers in the market for aerospace defense electronics 
the test measurement reportable segment consists solely of sypris test measurement  inc  which generates revenue primarily from providing technical services for the calibration  certification and repair of test and measurement equipment in the us our objective is to become the leading outsourcing specialist in each of our core markets for aerospace defense electronics  truck components assemblies  and test measurement services 
we have focused our efforts on establishing long term relationships with industry leaders who embrace multi year contractual relationships as a strategic component of their supply chain management 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting estimated amounts included in our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more complex judgments and estimates 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition in the industrial group  including cost of sales  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable based on overall receivable aging levels  a specific evaluation of accounts for customers with known financial difficulties and evaluation of customer chargebacks  if any 
these reserves and corresponding write offs could significantly increase if our customers experience deteriorating financial results or in the event we receive a significant chargeback  which is deemed uncollectible 

table of contents investments in marketable securities 
our investment in marketable securities is comprised exclusively of shares in dana common stock 
we account for our investments in equity securities under sfas no 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and measured at fair value as determined by a quoted market price 
under fas  unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported net of the related tax effect in other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity 
management evaluates its marketable securities for other than temporary impairment when the fair value of an investment declines below its original cost 
factors that are considered in the evaluation for other than temporary impairment include  among other things  the duration and extent of the decline  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  credit risk and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market 
if a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down is included in earnings 
the new cost basis is not to be changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
future increases or decreases in the fair value of available for sale securities are included in other comprehensive income 
further other than temporary impairment declines will be charged to earnings in the period that the declines are considered other than temporary 
the determination of whether a loss is other than temporary is highly judgmental and may have a material impact on our results of operations 
impairments 
goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment by calculating the estimated fair value of each business with which goodwill is associated 
the estimated fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis that requires judgment in our evaluation of the business and establishing an appropriate discount rate and terminal value to apply in the calculations 
in selecting these and other assumptions for each business  we consider historical performance  forecasted operating results  general market conditions and industry considerations specific to the business 
it is possible that the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment charges may occur 
we likely would compute a materially different fair value for a business if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change 
at december   net assets of our test measurement segment were million  including goodwill of million  and our aerospace defense segment had net assets of million  including goodwill of million 
if continued improvements in operations are not achieved and profitability deteriorates  we may be required to record an impairment charge to goodwill for the test measurement and or the aerospace defense segments 
long term contracts 
a large part of our aerospace defense segment business is derived from long term contracts for development  production and service activities  which we account for consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors  the aicpa s statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature  as applicable 
we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract 
primarily  we record long term  fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing net revenue 
revenue is recognized on these contracts when units are shipped or delivered to the customer  as applicable  with unit revenue based upon unit prices as set forth in the applicable contracts 
the costs attributed to contract revenue are based upon the estimated average costs of all units to be shipped 
revenue recognized under such milestones is limited to net revenue that we would recognize under the cost to cost method 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  revenue is recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion 
as we incur costs under cost reimbursement type contracts  we record net revenue 
cost reimbursement type contracts include time and materials and other level of effort type contracts 
as a general rule  we recognize net revenue and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost to cost and milestone methods of percentage of completion accounting than when we use the units of delivery method 
in addition  our profits and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long term government contracts undertaken  the costs incurred in their performance  the achievement of other performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees is finally determined 

table of contents contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenue and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
the majority of our aerospace defense segment net revenue is driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the us government  and therefore not necessarily on market based factors 
cost based pricing is determined under the federal acquisition regulations far 
the far provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under us government contracts 
for example  costs such as those related to charitable contributions  advertising  public relations and interest expense are unallowable  and therefore  not recoverable through net revenue 
approximately and of total net revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method based on units of delivery during and  respectively 
approximately of total net revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method based on milestones or cost to cost during and therefore  the amounts we record in our consolidated financial statements using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material 
because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required  any changes from prior estimates are generally included in earnings in the current period 
we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
in addition to less formal monthly reviews  management in the aerospace defense segment formally assesses the status of contracts on a quarterly basis through extensive estimate at completion reviews  which include multiple levels of program personnel 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are reviewed for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 
pension plan funded status 
the calculation of pension assets and liabilities involve complex estimation processes based on third party actuarially determined estimates  which rely on management estimates of the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets 
changes in these rates could significantly impact the actuarially determined amounts recorded in the statements of financial position 
reserve for excess  obsolete and scrap inventory 
we record inventory at the lower of cost  determined under the first in  first out method  or market  and we reserve for excess  obsolete or scrap inventory 
these reserves are primarily based upon management s assessment of the salability of the inventory  historical usage of raw materials  historical demand for finished goods and estimated future usage and demand 
an improper assessment of salability or improper estimate of future usage or demand  or significant changes in usage or demand could result in significant changes in the reserves and a positive or a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations in the period the change occurs 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions using the black scholes option pricing method  which requires the input of several subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based compensation and consequently  the related expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes as required by the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates 

table of contents as referenced in note to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  as of january  management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts 
in addition  under fin  judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of uncertain income tax positions 
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates  depending upon changes in income tax laws  actual results of operations  and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
we believe that our recorded income tax liabilities adequately provide for the probable outcome of these assessments 
deferred tax assets are also recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
however  sfas no 
requires that a valuation allowance be recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment is largely dependent upon projected near term profitability including the effects of tax planning 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction in which we conduct our operations or otherwise incur taxable income or losses 
results of operations the table presented below  which compares our consolidated results of operations from one year to another  presents the results for each year  the change in those results from one year to another in both dollars and percentage change and the results for each year as a percentage of net revenue 
the first two data columns in the table show the absolute results for each year presented 
the columns entitled year over year change and year over year percentage change show the change in results  both in dollars and percentages 
these two columns show favorable changes as positive and unfavorable changes as negative 
for example  when our net revenue increases from one year to the next  that change is shown as a positive number in both columns 
conversely  when expenses increase from one year to the next  that change is shown as a negative number in both columns 
the last two columns in the table show the results for each period as a percentage of net revenue 
in these two columns  the cost of sales and gross profit for each are given as a percentage of that segment s net revenue 
these amounts are shown in italics

the industrial group derives its revenue from manufacturing services and product sales 
net revenue in the industrial group decreased million to million in depressed market conditions for heavy and light trucks and commercial vehicles have contributed to volume related reductions in net 
table of contents revenue of approximately million 
volume declines for trailer axles caused a reduction from revenue also declined approximately million from the discontinued sale of housings components to a heavy truck market customer 
further  contractual settlements and price reductions resulted in a million decrease in net revenue from partially offsetting the volume change was an increase in steel prices  which is passed through to customers under certain contracts  resulting in an increase in net revenue of million 
the aerospace defense segment derives its revenue from product sales and technical outsourced services 
aerospace defense segment net revenue increased million to million primarily due to increased sales of link encryption products 
offsetting this was a reduction in sales of certain data recording products of million during the year 
technical outsourced services comprised million of the increase primarily as a result of the launch of several new programs 
the test measurement segment derives its revenue from technical services  including calibration and component screening  and product sales 
technical services revenue accounted for approximately and of total test measurement revenue in and  respectively 
test measurement segment net revenue increased million primarily as a result of a million increase in volumes of magnetic meters and a increase in calibration services 
component screening and product test revenue also increased million 
gross profit 
the industrial group s gross profit decreased million to million in the significant decrease in sales volume and related loss of fixed overhead absorption  combined with higher utilities of million  resulted in a reduction in gross profit of approximately million 
the industrial group also realized a decline in gross profit of million in as a result of lower revenue from contractual settlements and pricing as compared to the prior year 
the decreases in gross profit were partially offset by approximately million in various productivity improvements made during the year and favorable settlements with customers during the period 
the aerospace defense segment s gross profit decreased million to million in gross profit as a percentage of revenue for decreased to from in the increase in revenue for the segment in was comprised of a higher mix of lower margin services and product sales as compared to the prior year 
additionally  material cost increases on several programs reduced gross profit by million 
the test measurement segment s gross profit increased million in primarily due to increased revenues 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue of in was relatively consistent with at selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million in and increased as a percentage of net revenue to in from in primarily due to compensation related expenses  recruiting costs and higher employee benefit costs 
research and development 
research and development costs increased million in primarily due to new product development efforts for a next generation secured communications device within our aerospace defense segment 
impairment of goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual review of goodwill 
as a result of this review  the industrial group s goodwill was deemed to be impaired  resulting in a non cash impairment charge of million  representing the segment s entire goodwill balance 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
nonrecurring expense income  net 
in december  we announced a restructuring program  which included the closure of the industrial group s kenton  ohio facility  the consolidation of sypris electronics and sypris data systems into a single operation within the aerospace defense segment and the potential closure of other us based industrial group locations 
additionally  we have exited several programs within the aerospace defense segment 
the purpose of the restructuring program was to reduce fixed costs  accelerate integration efficiencies  and significantly improve operating earnings on a sustained basis 
as a result of these initiatives  we recorded  or expect to record in future periods  aggregate pre tax expenses of approximately million  consisting of the following million in severance and benefit costs  million in non cash asset impairments  million in non cash deferred contract costs write offs  million in inventory related charges  million in equipment relocation costs  million in asset retirement obligations  million in contract 
table of contents termination costs and million in other restructuring charges 
of the aggregate million in pre tax costs  the company expects approximately million to be cash related 
of the total program  we recorded million  or per share  related to these initiatives in  which is included in nonrecurring expense on the consolidated statement of operations 
the charge consisted of million for the write off of deferred contract costs  million in non cash asset impairment charges  million for inventory related charges  million in contract termination costs  million of employee severance and benefit costs  million in asset retirement obligations  million in equipment relocation costs and million in other various charges 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
nonrecurring items in include the gain recognized as part of the dana settlement agreement offset by the write off of certain accounts receivable and other assets  legal and professional fees incurred as a result of the dana bankruptcy filing and other transaction related costs 
interest expense  net 
interest expense increased million in our weighted average debt outstanding increased to million during from million during  primarily as a result of operating losses related to the decline in the industrial group s revenue 
the weighted average interest rate decreased to in from in primarily as a result of a drop in interest rates on the variable rate debt 
impairment of marketable securities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we review our marketable securities to determine whether a decline in fair value of the security below its cost basis is other than temporary 
at december   our investment in dana common stock was determined to be an other than temporary decline resulting in a million non cash impairment charge to results of operation 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k

table of contents quarterly results the following table presents our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the two year period ended december  beginning january   we began to report quarterly results on a fiscal quarter basis 
we have prepared this data on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and  in our opinion  have included all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of this information 
you should read these unaudited quarterly results in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report

table of contents liquidity  capital resources and financial condition there are several risks and uncertainties relating to the global economy and the automotive industry that could materially affect our financial condition  future results of operations and liquidity 
these risk and uncertainties could result in decreased sales  limited access to credit  rising costs  increased competition  customer or supplier bankruptcies  delays in customer payment terms and acceleration of supplier payments  growing inventories and failure to meet debt covenants 
as a result of a continued decline in the overall economy  we have taken significant actions during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of to reduce our cost base and improve profitability  including moving forward with various plant shutdowns and other workforce reductions 
based on our current forecast for  we expect to be able to meet the financial covenants of our amended debt agreements and have sufficient liquidity to finance our operations 
although we believe the assumptions underlying our current forecast are achievable  we have considered the possibility of even lower revenues and other risk factors  such as our ability to execute the current cost reduction plans 
our ability to service our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate this cash will depend largely on future operations 
as disclosed elsewhere  our operating results were significantly lower than our expectations  in part due to precipitous declines within the commercial vehicle and or heavy truck industry 
as a result of the deterioration in results  as well as other factors  we recorded goodwill and long lived asset impairment charges and also applied a full valuation allowance to our domestic deferred tax assets 
based upon our current level of operations and our business plan  we believe that cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our amended credit agreements will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
a continued decline in the overall market could require us to seek additional funds from external sources or to refinance all or a portion of our existing indebtedness in order to meet our liquidity requirements 
we cannot make assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or raise additional capital through other means on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we have insufficient cash flow to fund our liquidity needs and are unable to refinance our indebtedness or raise additional capital  we could come into default under our debt instruments 
in addition  we may be unable to pursue growth opportunities in new and existing markets and to fund our capital expenditure needs 
as of december   the company was in default with certain covenants under both the revolving credit agreement and senior notes 
however  the company s revolving credit agreement and senior notes were amended as of march  to  among other things  i waive the default as of december   ii limit total borrowings  iii revise the maturity date for the credit agreement and senior notes to january  iv revise certain financial covenants  v restrict the payment of dividends  vi require mandatory prepayment to the extent that marketable securities or other collateral is sold  and vii increase the company s interest rate structure 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  as compared to net cash used of million in  due to the timing of collections and a focus on bringing inventory levels down to meet current demand 
in  accounts receivable decreased and provided million  as a result of reduced volumes combined with a continued emphasis on collections with significant customers 
inventory decreased in and provided million primarily as a result lower inventory levels to adjust for lower sales volumes 
other current assets decreased in and provided million primarily due to a million cash receipt associated with the dana settlement partially offset by income taxes refundable of million for our mexican subsidiary 
accounts payable decreased and used million primarily due to the decrease in cost of sales  the reduction in inventory and timing of capital expenditures 
accrued liabilities decreased and used million primarily due to a million payment in for income taxes in mexico applicable to other non cash items in include amortization of deferred revenue attributable to the dana settlement 
net cash used in investing activities was million in as compared to million in capital expenditures increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of additional capital expenditures at our mexican subsidiary to support new products 
partially offsetting this was an increase in the proceeds from the sale of assets to million 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities was million in as compared to million in  primarily due to additional borrowing of million in additionally  we paid million in financing fees in conjunction with modifications of our debt in we had total borrowings under our revolving credit facility of million at december   and an unrestricted cash balance of million 
approximately million of the unrestricted cash balance relates to our mexican subsidiaries 
maximum borrowings on the revolving credit agreement are million

in june  the fasb issued fasb staff position eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
this fsp addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions may be participating securities prior to vesting and  therefore  need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing basic earnings per share eps pursuant to the two class method described in paragraphs and of sfas no 
 earnings per share 
a share based payment award that contains a non forfeitable right to receive cash when dividends are paid to common shareholders irrespective of whether that award ultimately vests or remains unvested shall be considered a participating security as these rights to dividends provide a non contingent transfer of value to the holder of the share based payment award 
accordingly  these awards should be included in the computation of basic eps pursuant to the two class method 
the guidance in this fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those years 
early adoption is not permitted 
all prior period eps data will be adjusted retrospectively to reflect the provisions of the fsp 
under the terms of the company s restricted stock awards  grantees are entitled to receive dividends on the unvested portions of their awards 
there is no requirement to return these dividends in the event the unvested awards are forfeited in the future 
accordingly  this fsp will have an effect on the company s eps calculations and the company will continue to evaluate the effects of this guidance
