item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
reinsurance segment our reinsurance operations are comprised of three units property catastrophe reinsurance  primarily written through renaissance reinsurance and davinci  specialty reinsurance  primarily written through renaissance reinsurance and davinci  and certain other activities of ventures as described herein 
our reinsurance operations are managed by the president of renaissance reinsurance  who leads a team of underwriters  risk modelers and other industry professionals  who have access to our proprietary risk management  underwriting and modeling resources and tools 
we believe the expertise of our underwriting and modeling team and our proprietary analytic tools  together with superior customer service  provide us with a significant competitive advantage 
our portfolio of business has continued to be increasingly characterized by relatively large transactions with ceding companies with whom we do business  although no current relationship exceeds of our gross premiums written 
accordingly  our gross premiums written are subject to significant fluctuations depending on our success in maintaining or expanding our relationships with these large customers 
we believe that recent market dynamics  and trends in our industry in respect of potential future consolidation  have increased our exposure to the risks of broker  client and counterparty concentration 
the following table shows our total catastrophe and specialty reinsurance gross premiums written year ended december  in thousands renaissance catastrophe premiums renaissance specialty premiums total renaissance premiums davinci catastrophe premiums davinci specialty premiums total davinci premiums total reinsurance premiums total specialty premiums total catastrophe premiums 
table of contents total specialty premiums written includes nil  million and million of premiums assumed from our individual risk segment for the years ended december   and  respectively 
total catastrophe premiums written includes million  million and million of premiums assumed from our individual risk segment for the years ended december   and  respectively 
property catastrophe reinsurance we believe we are one of the largest providers of property catastrophe reinsurance in the world  based on our total catastrophe premium 
our principal property catastrophe reinsurance products include catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance and excess of loss retrocessional reinsurance as described below catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance 
we principally write catastrophe reinsurance on an excess of loss basis  which means we provide coverage to our insureds when aggregate claims and claim expenses from a single occurrence of a covered peril exceed the attachment point specified in a particular contract 
under these contracts we indemnify an insurer for a portion of the losses on insurance policies in excess of a specified loss amount  and up to an amount per loss specified in the contract 
the coverage provided under excess of loss reinsurance contracts may be on a worldwide basis or limited in scope to selected geographic areas 
coverage can also vary from all property perils to limited coverage on selected perils  such as earthquake only coverage 
excess of loss retrocessional reinsurance 
we also write retrocessional reinsurance contracts that provide property catastrophe coverage to other reinsurers or retrocedants 
in providing retrocessional reinsurance  we focus on property catastrophe retrocessional reinsurance which covers the retrocedant on an excess of loss basis when aggregate claims and claim expenses from a single occurrence of a covered peril and from a multiple number of reinsureds exceed a specified attachment point 
the coverage provided under excess of loss retrocessional contracts may be on a worldwide basis or limited in scope to selected geographic areas 
coverage can also vary from all property perils to limited coverage on selected perils  such as earthquake only coverage 
the information available to retrocessional underwriters concerning the original primary risk can be less precise than the information received from primary companies directly 
moreover  exposures from retrocessional business can change within a contract term as the underwriters of a retrocedant alter their book of business after retrocessional coverage has been bound 
our property catastrophe reinsurance contracts are generally all risk in nature 
our most significant exposure is to losses from earthquakes and hurricanes and other windstorms  although we are also exposed to claims arising from other catastrophes  such as tsunamis  freezes  floods  fires  tornadoes  explosions and acts of terrorism in connection with the coverages we provide 
our predominant exposure under such coverage is to property damage 
however  other risks  including business interruption and other non property losses  may also be covered under our property reinsurance contracts when arising from a covered peril 
we offer our coverages on a worldwide basis 
because of the wide range of possible catastrophic events to which we are exposed  including the size of such events and because of the potential for multiple events to occur in the same time period  our catastrophe reinsurance business is volatile and our results of operations reflect this volatility 
further  our financial condition may be impacted by this volatility over time or at any point in time 
the effects of claims from one or a number of severe catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on us 
we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property and the effects of inflation will increase the severity of such occurrences in the future 
catastrophe linked securities 
we also invest in catastrophe linked securities cat linked securities 
cat linked securities are generally privately placed fixed income securities as to which all or a portion of the repayment of the principal is linked to catastrophic events  for example  the occurrence of one or more hurricanes or earthquakes producing industry losses exceeding certain specified thresholds 
we underwrite  model  evaluate and monitor these securities using the same tools and techniques used to evaluate our more traditional property catastrophe reinsurance business assumed 
in addition  we may enter into derivative transactions  such as total return swaps  that are based on or referenced to underlying cat linked securities 
based on an evaluation of the specific features of each cat linked security  we account for these 
table of contents securities as reinsurance or at fair value  as applicable  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in addition  in future periods we may utilize the growing market for cat linked securities to expand our ceded reinsurance buying if we find the pricing and terms of such coverage attractive 
we seek to moderate the volatility of our risk portfolio through superior risk selection  diversification and the purchase of retrocessional coverages and other protections 
in furtherance of our strategy  we may increase or decrease our presence in the catastrophe reinsurance business based on market conditions and our assessment of risk adjusted pricing adequacy 
we frequently seek to purchase reinsurance or other protection for our own account to further reduce the financial impact that a large catastrophe or a series of catastrophes could have on our results 
as a result of our position in the market and reputation for superior customer service  we believe we have superior access to business we view as desirable compared to the market as a whole 
as described above  we use our proprietary underwriting tools and guidelines to attempt to construct an attractive portfolio from these opportunities 
we dynamically model policy submissions against our current in force underwriting portfolio  comparing our estimate of the modeled expected returns of the contract against the amount of capital that we allocate to the contract  based on our estimate of its marginal impact on our overall risk portfolio 
at times  our approach to portfolio management has resulted and may result in the future in our having a relatively large market share of catastrophe reinsurance exposure in a particular geographic region  such as florida  or to a particular peril  such as us hurricane risk  where we believe supply and demand characteristics promote our providing significant capacity  or where the risks or class of risks otherwise adds efficiency to our portfolio 
conversely  from time to time we may have a disproportionately low market share in certain regions or perils where we believe our capital would be less effectively deployed 
specialty reinsurance we write a number of lines of reinsurance other than property catastrophe  such as catastrophe exposed workers compensation  surety  terrorism  medical malpractice  catastrophe exposed personal lines property  casualty clash  certain other casualty lines and other specialty lines of reinsurance  which we collectively refer to as specialty reinsurance 
as with our catastrophe business  our team of experienced professionals seek to underwrite these lines using a disciplined underwriting approach and sophisticated analytical tools 
we generally target lines of business where we believe we can adequately quantify the risks assumed and where potential losses could be characterized as low frequency and high severity  similar to our catastrophe reinsurance coverages 
we also seek to identify market dislocations and write new lines of business whose risk and return characteristics are estimated to exceed our hurdle rates 
we also seek to manage the correlations of this business with our overall portfolio  including our aggregate exposure to single and aggregated catastrophe events 
we believe that our underwriting and analytical capabilities have positioned us well to manage this business 
we offer our specialty reinsurance products principally on an excess of loss basis  as described above with respect to our catastrophe reinsurance products  and also provide some proportional coverage 
in a proportional reinsurance arrangement also referred to as quota share reinsurance and pro rata reinsurance  the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the original premiums and losses of the reinsured 
the reinsurer pays the cedant a commission which is generally based on the cedant s cost of acquiring the business being reinsured including commissions  premium taxes  assessments and miscellaneous administrative expenses and may also include a profit factor 
our products generally include tailored features such as limits or sub limits which we believe help us manage our exposures 
any liability exceeding  or otherwise not subject to  such limits reverts to the cedant 
as with our catastrophe reinsurance business  our specialty reinsurance frequently provides coverage for relatively large limits or exposures  and thus we are subject to potential significant claims volatility 
we generally seek to write significant lines on our specialty reinsurance treaties 
as a result of our financial strength  we have the ability to offer significant capacity and  for select risks  we have made available significant limits 
we believe these capabilities  the strength of our specialty reinsurance underwriting team  and our demonstrated ability and willingness to pay valid claims are competitive advantages of our specialty reinsurance business 

table of contents ventures we pursue a number of other opportunities through our ventures unit  which has responsibility for managing our joint venture relationships  executing customized reinsurance transactions to assume or cede risk and managing certain investments directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe reinsurance 
property catastrophe managed joint ventures 
we actively manage property catastrophe oriented joint ventures  which provide us with an additional presence in the market  enhance client relationships and generate fee income 
these joint ventures allow us to leverage our access to business and our underwriting capabilities on a larger capital base 
currently  our joint ventures include top layer re and davinci 
rum  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  acts as the exclusive underwriting manager for each of these joint ventures 
davinci was established in and principally writes property catastrophe reinsurance and certain low frequency  high severity specialty reinsurance lines of business on a global basis 
in general  we seek to construct for davinci a property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio with risk characteristics similar to those of renaissance reinsurance s property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio and certain lines of specialty reinsurance such as terrorism and catastrophe exposed workers compensation 
in accordance with davinci s underwriting guidelines  it can only participate in business that is underwritten by renaissance reinsurance 
we maintain majority voting control of davincire and  accordingly  consolidate the results of davincire into our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
we seek to manage davinci s capital efficiently over time in light of the market opportunities and needs we perceive and believe we are able to serve 
our ownership in davincire was and at december  and  respectively 
on january   we purchased the shares of certain third party davincire shareholders for million  less a million reserve holdback 
the purchase price was based on gaap book value as of december  as a result of these purchases  our ownership interest in davincire increased to 
we expect our ownership in davincire to fluctuate over time 
top layer re writes high excess non us property catastrophe reinsurance 
top layer re is owned by state farm mutual automobile insurance company state farm and by roihl  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
state farm provides billion of stop loss reinsurance coverage to top layer re 
we account for our equity ownership in top layer re under the equity method of accounting and our proportionate share of its results are reflected in equity in losses earnings of other ventures in our consolidated statements of operations 
during and  we participated in the formation of starbound ii and starbound re  respectively 
these joint ventures provided capacity to the us property catastrophe market  primarily for the and us hurricane seasons  respectively 
while these joint ventures were active we owned a minority interest share of the entities and accounted for them as investments in other ventures  under equity method 
these joint ventures have subsequently terminated and have returned capital to the joint venture shareholders 
effective july  and august  we repurchased all of the issued and outstanding share capital of starbound ii and starbound re  respectively 
we now account for these entities as consolidated subsidiaries 
in addition  in may  the company sold third party capital in tim re  currently a wholly owned subsidiary  to provide additional capacity to accept property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance business for the hurricane season  in return for a profit commission 
in january  the company purchased all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of tim re 
the company accounts for tim re as a consolidated subsidiary 
ventures works on a range of other customized reinsurance transactions 
for example  we have participated  and continuously analyze other attractive opportunities to participate  in the market for cat linked securities and derivatives 
we also offer products through which we cede participations in the performance of our catastrophe reinsurance portfolio 
we believe our products contain a number of customized features designed to fit the needs of our partners  as well as our risk management objectives 

table of contents strategic investments 
ventures also pursues strategic investments where  rather than assuming exclusive management responsibilities ourselves  we instead partner with other market participants 
these investments are directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe  and at times may also be directed at non insurance risks 
we find these investments attractive both for their expected returns  and also because they provide us diversification benefits and information and exposure to other aspects of the market 
an example of these investments includes our investment in tower hill insurance group  llc thig  tower hill claims services  llc thcs and tower hill claims management  llc thcm collectively  the tower hill companies  which operate primarily in the state of florida 
thig is a managing general agency specializing in insurance coverage for site built and manufactured homes 
thcs and thcm provide claim adjustment services through exclusive agreements with thig 
during the third quarter of  we invested million in the tower hill companies  representing a ownership interest  to expand our core platforms by obtaining ownership in an additional distribution channel for the florida homeowners market and to enhance our relationships with other stakeholders 
weather related activities 
we undertake weather related consulting and trading activities through our operating companies including weather predict  wp consulting  aef  rim and rtl 
weather predict  wp consulting and aef provide fee based consulting services  sell weather related information and forecasts  and engage in education  research and development  and loss mitigation activities  such as the renaissancere wall of wind research facility located in southern florida and the stormstruck interactive weather experience at the walt disney world resort in florida 
rtl sells certain financial products primarily to address weather risks  and engages in certain weather  energy and commodity derivatives trading activities 
principally through rtl  we expect that our participation will increase in the trading markets for securities and derivatives linked to energy  commodities  weather  other natural phenomena  and or products or indices linked in part to such phenomena 
as this unit grows  we are seeking to develop client and customer relationships  continuing to invest in operating and control environment systems and procedures  hire staff and develop and install management information and other systems 
we are also taking numerous other steps to implement our strategies 
success in executing our strategies in respect of this unit requires us to develop new expertise in certain areas 
business activities that appear in our consolidated underwriting results  such as davinci and certain reinsurance transactions  are included in our reinsurance segment results  the results of our investments  such as top layer re  channelre holdings ltd 
channelre  starbound ii  platinum underwriters holdings ltd 
platinum  our weather related activities and other ventures are included in the other category of our segment results 
competition the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  and we believe that competition is increasing and becoming more robust 
with respect to our reinsurance operations  we believe that our principal competitors include other companies active in the bermuda market including ace limited ace  allied world assurance company ltd 
allied world  arch capital group arch  axis capital holdings axis  endurance specialty holdings ltd 
endurance  everest re group ltd 
everest re  ipc holdings  ltd 
ipc  montpelier re holdings ltd 
montpelier re  partnerre ltd 
partner re  platinum  transatlantic holdings inc transatlantic  validus holdings  ltd 
validus  white mountains insurance group ltd 
white mountains and xl capital ltd 
xl we also compete with certain lloyd s syndicates active in the london market  as well as with a number of other industry participants  such as american international group  inc aig  berkshire hathaway berkshire  hannover re  munich re group and swiss re 
as our business evolves over time we expect our competitors to change as well 
while their participation in the reinsurance market may be decreasing somewhat due to the current issues facing the capital and credit markets  hedge funds  investment banks  exchanges and other capital market participants have also shown increasing interest over the past several years in entering the reinsurance market 
for example  over the last several years there has been substantial growth in financial products such as exchange traded catastrophe options  cat linked securities  catastrophe linked derivative agreements and other financial products  intended to compete with traditional reinsurance 
we believe that competition from non traditional sources such as these will continue to increase in the future 
many of 
table of contents these new competitors have greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
in addition  the tax policies of the countries where our clients operate  as well as government sponsored or backed catastrophe funds  affect demand for reinsurance 
we are unable to predict the extent to which the foregoing new  proposed or potential initiatives may affect the demand for our products or the risks which may be available for us when providing coverage 
individual risk segment we define our individual risk segment to include underwriting that involves understanding the characteristics of the original underlying insurance policy 
our individual risk segment is managed by the chief executive officer of the glencoe group 
our individual risk operations seek to identify and write classes of business which are attractively priced relative to the risk exposure and  particularly in the case of catastrophe exposed risks  where our expertise in modeling  analytical tools and information systems may provide a competitive advantage 
the following table shows our individual risk gross premiums written by major type of business year ended december  gross premiums written percentage of gross premiums written gross premiums written percentage of gross premiums written gross premiums written percentage of gross premiums written in thousands  except percentages individual risk gross premiums written multi peril crop commercial property commercial multi line personal lines property total individual risk gross premiums written our individual risk business is written by the glencoe group through its principal operating subsidiaries agro national a managing general underwriter of multi peril crop insurance that participates in the us federal government s multi peril crop insurance program  glencoe a bermuda domiciled excess and surplus lines insurance company that is currently eligible to do business on an excess and surplus lines basis in us jurisdictions  lantana a bermuda domiciled insurance company currently eligible as an excess and surplus lines carrier in us jurisdictions  stonington a texas domiciled insurance company that is licensed on an admitted basis in all states and the district of columbia  and stonington lloyds insurance company stonington lloyds a texas domiciled lloyds plan insurer 
our principal contracts include insurance policies and quota share reinsurance with respect to risks including multi peril crop  which includes multi peril crop insurance  crop hail and other named peril agriculture risk management products  commercial property  which principally includes catastrophe exposed commercial property products  commercial multi line  which includes commercial property and liability coverage  such as general liability  automobile liability and physical damage  building and contents  professional liability and various specialty products  and personal lines property  which principally includes homeowners personal lines property coverage and catastrophe exposed personal lines property coverage 

table of contents our individual risk business is produced primarily through four distribution channels wholly owned program manager we write specialty lines primary insurance through a wholly owned specialized program manager  third party program managers we write specialty lines primary insurance through third party specialized program managers  who produce business pursuant to agreed upon underwriting guidelines and provide related back office functions  quota share reinsurance we write quota share reinsurance with primary insurers who produce business pursuant to agreed upon underwriting guidelines and provide most back office functions  and broker produced business we write primary insurance produced through brokers on a risk by risk basis

we seek to identify and do business with third party program managers and quota share reinsurance cedants whom we believe utilize superior underwriting methodologies 
we rely on these third parties for services including policy issuance  premium collection  claims processing  and compliance with various state laws and regulations including licensing 
we seek to work closely with these partners  attempting to employ our analytical methodologies and  where appropriate  our expertise in catastrophe risk  to arrive at adequate pricing for the risks being underwritten 
we seek to structure these relationships to provide value to both parties and meaningful protections to us 
historically  our strategy relating to program manager relationships has been to pursue a relatively small number of relatively large relationships 
currently  we are investing in initiatives to strengthen our operating platform  enhance our internal capabilities  and expand the resources we commit to our individual risk operations 
in furtherance of these initiatives  in we completed the acquisition of substantially all the net assets of agro national  llc and claims management services  inc cms 
we actively oversee our third party relationships through an operations review team at glencoe specialty services and through the use of proprietary tools such as pacer 
our operations review team includes professionals from diverse disciplines including actuarial science  accounting  claims management  law  regulatory compliance and underwriting 
this group assists with the initial due diligence as well as the ongoing monitoring of these third parties 
our ongoing monitoring includes periodic audits of our third party program managers and third party administrators 
in addition  for our large third party program managers 
table of contents we maintain an employee in an underwriting capacity on site at the program manager to oversee the program manager s compliance with our prescribed underwriting guidelines 
we generally seek to have contractual performance standards for each of our programs and third party administrators whose compensation is subject to adjustment based on meeting these standards 
the program operations team audits compliance with our underwriting guidelines and contractually agreed operating guidelines and performance standards 
the program operations team also seeks to ensure corrective action is taken quickly to resolve issues identified during the audit process 
competition in our individual risk business  we face competition from independent insurance companies  subsidiaries or affiliates of major worldwide companies and others  some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
primary insurers compete on the basis of various factors including distribution channels  product  price  service  financial strength and reputation 
many of our reinsurance segment competitors listed above also compete for the program business and quota share reinsurance we write within our individual risk segment 
we believe that our principal competitors in the program business of our individual risk segment include operating subsidiaries of aig  arch  wr berkley corp 
berkley  berkshire  endurance  hannover re and zurich financial services group zurich 
in our individual risk business  we compete not only in respect of the insurance and reinsurance products we offer  but in respect of the contractual relationships with the third party program managers with whom we seek to partner 
increased competition in respect of our products could result in decreased premium rates  less attractive terms and conditions  and a decrease in our share of attractive programs 
increased competition in respect of our program manager partners  as to whom we are extremely selective and whose relationship we seek to tightly manage in a disciplined  consistent fashion  could result in less favorable terms and conditions in respect of our contractual arrangements with our partners  the loss of existing program manager relationships  or constrain our ability to add new relationships to our operations 
in addition  there has been a growing trend of insurance and reinsurance companies acquiring third party program managers 
acquisitions of third party program managers with whom we do business by other insurance or reinsurance companies could result in us losing that program manager relationship 
any of the foregoing could adversely impact the growth and profitability of our individual risk segment 
ratings financial strength ratings are an important factor in respect of the competitive position of reinsurance and insurance companies 
rating organizations continually review the financial positions of our reinsurers and insurers 
over the last five years  we have received high claims paying and financial strength ratings from am best co 
am best  standard poor s rating agency s p  moody s and fitch 
these ratings represent independent opinions of an insurer s financial strength  operating performance and ability to meet policyholder obligations  and are not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy  sell or hold any of our securities 

table of contents presented below are the ratings of our principal operating subsidiaries and joint ventures by segment and the senior debt ratings of renaissancere as of february  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources credit ratings for information about recent ratings actions

the am best  s p  moody s and fitch ratings for renaissancere represent the credit ratings on its senior unsecured debt 
am best 
a is the second highest designation of am best s sixteen rating levels 
a rated insurance companies are defined as superior companies and are considered by am best to have a very strong ability to meet their obligations to policyholders 
a is the third highest designation assigned by am best  representing am best s opinion that the insurer has an excellent ability to meet its ongoing obligations to policyholders 
am best also assigns a financial size category to each of the insurance companies rated 
vii represents a company with million in capital  xi represents a company with million billion in capital  xii represents a company with billion in capital and xiv represents a company with billion in capital 
the outlooks for all companies rated by am best are stable 
in addition  am best assigns an issuer credit rating icr to an entity which is an opinion on the ability of an entity to meet its senior obligations 
renaissancere has been assigned a which is defined as excellent by am best and the outlook is considered stable 
s p 
the aa range aa  aa  aa  which has been assigned by s p to renaissance reinsurance  renaissance europe and top layer re  is the second highest rating assigned by s p  and indicates that s p believes the insurers have very strong financial security characteristics  differing only slightly from those rated higher 
davinci has been assigned a rating of a by s p  indicating the insurer has strong financial security characteristics but is somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are insurers with higher ratings 
s p also assigns an issuer credit rating to an entity which is an opinion on the credit worthiness of obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation 
renaissancere has been assigned an icr of a  which is the third highest rating assigned by s p 
moody s 
moody s insurance financial strength ratings and moody s credit ratings represent its opinions of the ability of insurance companies to pay punctually policyholder claims and obligations and senior unsecured debt instruments 
moody s believes that insurance companies rated a  such as renaissance reinsurance  and companies rated baa  such as renaissancere  offer good financial security 
however  moody s believes that elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future 

table of contents fitch 
fitch ratings ltd 
issuer financial strength ratings provide an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization 
fitch believes that insurance companies rated a  such as renaissance reinsurance  have strong capacity to meet policyholders and contract obligations on a timely basis with a low expectation of ceased or interrupted payments 
fitch also provides long term credit ratings  used as a benchmark measure of probability of default  these were formerly described as issuer default ratings 
renaissancere has been rated bbb  meaning there are currently expectations of low credit risk 
while the ratings of our principal operating subsidiaries and joint ventures within our reinsurance segment remain among the highest in our business  adverse ratings actions could have a negative effect on our ability to fully realize current or future market opportunities 
in addition  it is common for our reinsurance contracts to contain provisions permitting our clients to cancel coverage pro rata if our relevant operating subsidiary is downgraded below a certain rating level 
whether a client would exercise this right would depend  among other factors  on the reason for such a downgrade  the extent of the downgrade  the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage 
therefore  in the event of a downgrade  it is not possible to predict in advance the extent to which this cancellation right would be exercised  if at all  or what effect such cancellations would have on the financial condition or future operations  but such effect potentially could be material 
to date we are not aware that we have experienced such a cancellation 
our ratings are subject to periodic review and may be revised or revoked by the agencies which issue them 
underwriting and enterprise risk management underwriting our primary underwriting goal is to construct a portfolio of reinsurance and insurance contracts and other financial risks that maximizes our return on shareholders equity  subject to prudent risk constraints  and to generate long term growth in tangible book value per common share plus accumulated dividends 
we assess each new re insurance contract on the basis of the expected incremental return relative to the incremental contribution to portfolio risk 
reinsurance we have developed a proprietary  computer based pricing and exposure management system  rems 
since inception  we have continued to invest in and improve rems  incorporating our underwriting experience  additional proprietary software and a significant amount of new industry data 
rems has analytic and modeling capabilities that help us to assess the risk and return of each incremental reinsurance contract in relation to our overall portfolio of reinsurance contracts 
we combine the analyses generated by rems with other information available to us  including our own knowledge of the client submitting the proposed program  to assess the premium offered against the risk of loss which the program presents 
we have licensed and integrated into rems a number of third party catastrophe computer models in addition to our base model  which we use to validate and stress test our base rems results 
rems is most developed in analyzing catastrophe risks 
we believe that our tools for assessing non catastrophe risks are much less sophisticated and much less well developed than those for catastrophe risks 
we continuously strive to improve our analytical techniques relating to non catastrophe risks 
we believe that rems is a more robust underwriting and risk management system than is currently commercially available elsewhere in the reinsurance industry 
before we bind a reinsurance risk  exposure data is typically gathered from clients and this exposure data is input into the rems modeling system 
we believe that the rems modeling system helps us to analyze each policy on a consistent basis  assisting our determination of what we believe to be an appropriate price to charge for each policy based upon the risk that is assumed 
rems combines computer generated statistical simulations that estimate event probabilities with exposure and coverage information on each client s reinsurance contract to produce expected claims for reinsurance programs submitted to us 
our models employ simulation techniques to generate  years of loss activity  including events causing in excess of billion in insured losses 
from this simulation  we generate a probability distribution of potential outcomes for each policy in our portfolio and for our total portfolio 
in part through the utilization of rems we seek to compare our estimate of the expected returns in respect of a contract with the amount of capital that we notionally 
table of contents allocate to the contract based on our estimate of its marginal impact on our portfolio of risks 
we have also customized rems by including additional perils  risks and geographic areas that may not be captured in the commercially available models 
we periodically review the estimates and assumptions that are reflected in rems and our other tools 
for example  in the second half of we revised our assumptions relating to atlantic basin hurricane frequency and severity 
while many commercial catastrophe models base their frequency and severity distributions on the last years of hurricane activity  assuming that this time frame is an appropriate framework on which to base estimates of the hurricane risk to which the insurance industry is exposed  we currently do not believe  based on our review of the scientific literature  private research  and discussions with climatologists  meteorologists and other weather scientists  including those at weather predict  that the past years of data is reflective of current climatological risks 
in particular  we believe there has been an increase in the frequency and severity of hurricanes that have the potential to make landfall in the us  potentially as a result of decadal ocean water temperature cyclical trends  a longer term trend towards global warming  or both or other factors 
we started using these revised assumptions in rems to model and evaluate our portfolio of risk in the latter part of the process of updating all of the underlying risk models is continuous  and many of the assumptions involve significant judgment on our part  and further experience or scientific research may lead us to further adjust these assumptions 
changes in our modeled assumptions may impact from time to time the amount of capacity we are prepared to offer 
our catastrophe reinsurance underwriters use rems in their pricing decisions  which we believe provides them with several competitive advantages 
these include the ability to simulate a greater number of years of catastrophic event activity compared to a much smaller sample in generally available models  allowing us to analyze exposure to a greater number and combination of potential events  to analyze the incremental impact of an individual reinsurance contract on our overall portfolio  to better assess the underlying exposures associated with assumed retrocessional business  to price contracts within a short time frame  to capture various classes of risk  including catastrophe and other insurance risks  to assess risk across multiple entities including our various joint ventures and across different components of our capital structure  and to provide consistent pricing information 
as part of our risk management process  we also use rems to assist us with the purchase of reinsurance coverage for our own account 
we have developed underwriting guidelines  to be used in conjunction with rems  that seek to limit the exposure to claims from any single catastrophic event and the exposure to losses from a series of catastrophic events 
as part of our pricing and underwriting process  we also assess a variety of other factors  including the reputation of the proposed cedant and the likelihood of establishing a long term relationship with the cedant  the geographic area in which the cedant does business and its market share  historical loss data for the cedant and  where available  for the industry as a whole in the relevant regions  in order to compare the cedant s historical catastrophe loss experience to industry averages  the cedant s pricing strategies  and the perceived financial strength of the cedant 

table of contents in order to estimate the risk profile of each line of specialty reinsurance  we establish probability distributions and assess the correlations with the rest of our portfolio 
in lines with catastrophe risk  such as excess workers compensation and terrorism  we are leveraging directly off our skill in modeling for our property catastrophe reinsurance risks  and seek to appropriately estimate and manage the correlations between these specialty lines and our catastrophe reinsurance portfolio 
for other classes of business  in which we believe we have little or no natural catastrophe exposure  and hence estimate we will have significantly less correlation with our property catastrophe reinsurance coverages  we derive probability distributions from a variety of underlying information sources  including recent historical experience  but with the application of judgment as appropriate 
the nature of some of these businesses lends itself less to the analysis that we use for our property catastrophe reinsurance coverages  reflecting both the nature of available exposure information  and the impact of human factors such as tort exposure 
we produce probability distributions to represent our estimates of the related underlying risks which our products cover  which we believe helps us to make consistent underwriting decisions and to manage our total risk portfolio 
overall  we undertake to construct conservative representations of the risks within our models  although there can be no assurance that this has occurred or will occur in the future 
individual risk for our catastrophe exposed business in our individual risk segment  we utilize proprietary modeling tools that have been developed in conjunction with the modeling and other resources utilized in our reinsurance operations  as described above 
we also combine these analyses with those of our reinsurance segment to monitor our aggregate group catastrophic exposures 
in general  we believe our techniques for evaluating catastrophe risk are better developed than those for other classes of risk 
for the business produced through third party program managers  we seek to carefully identify and evaluate potential third party program managers 
when evaluating a potential new program manager  we consider numerous factors including i whether the program manager can provide and help us analyze historic loss and other business data  ii whether the program manager will agree to accept a portion of their compensation based on the underwriting performance of their program and provide us with the other terms and conditions we require  iii our assessment of the integrity and experience of the program manager s management team  iv the potential profitability of the program to us  and v the availability of our internal resources to appropriately conduct due diligence  negotiate and execute transaction terms  and provide the ongoing monitoring we require 
in considering pricing for the products to be offered by the program manager  we evaluate the expected frequency and severity of losses  the costs of providing the necessary coverage including the cost of administering policy benefits  sales and other administrative and overhead costs  the necessity of third party reinsurance  the estimated costs thereof and an anticipated margin for profit 
in addition to utilizing rems  within our individual risk operations we have developed a proprietary information management and analytical database  pacer  within which our data related to substantially all our business is maintained 
with the use and development of pacer  we are seeking to develop statistical and analytical techniques to evaluate the us program lines of business we write within this segment and which over time we hope will create a competitive advantage 
we believe that pacer helps our clients better understand their business  thus creating value for them and us 
for example  we believe that pacer enables us to better identify and estimate the expected loss experience of particular products and pacer is employed in the design of our products and the establishment of rates 
we also seek to monitor pricing adequacy on our products by region  risk and producer 
subject to regulatory considerations  we seek to make timely premium and coverage modifications where we determine them to be appropriate 
we provide our third party program managers with written underwriting guidelines and monitor their compliance with our guidelines on a regular basis 
also  our contracts generally provide that a portion of the commission payable to our third party program managers will be on a retrospective basis  which is intended to permit us to adjust commissions based on our profitability and claims experience once an underwriting year is reasonably mature 
we rely on our third party program managers to perform underwriting pursuant to these contractual guidelines  and believe we benefit from their superior local information and expertise in niche areas 

table of contents enterprise risk management we have sought to develop and utilize a series of tools and processes that support a robust system of enterprise risk management erm within our organization 
we consider erm to be a key process  overseen by our senior management team under the supervision of our board of directors  and implemented by personnel from across our organization 
we believe that erm helps us to identify potential events that may affect us  to quantify  evaluate and manage the risks to which we are exposed  and to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of our objectives 
we believe that effective erm can provide us with a significant competitive advantage 
we also believe that effective erm assists our efforts to minimize the likelihood of suffering financial outcomes in excess of the ranges which we have estimated in respect of specific investments  underwriting decisions  or other operating or business activities 
we believe that our risk management tools support our strategy of pursuing opportunities created by dislocated markets and help us to identify opportunities that we believe to be the most attractive 
our risk management tools allow us to monitor our capital position  on a consolidated basis and for each of our major operating subsidiaries  and these tools help us determine the appropriate amount of capital to support the risks that we have assumed in the aggregate and for each of our major operating subsidiaries 
we believe that our risk management efforts are essential to our corporate strategy and our goal of achieving long term growth in tangible book value per share plus accumulated dividends for our shareholders 
our erm framework comprises four key activities  as set forth below underwriting and other quantifiable risks 
we believe that our operations are subject to a number of key risks  including underwriting risk  credit risk and interest rate risk as they relate to investments  ceded reinsurance credit risk and strategic investment risk  each of which can be analyzed in substantial part through quantitative tools and techniques 
of these  we believe underwriting risk to be the most material to us 
in order to understand  monitor  quantify and proactively assess underwriting risk  we seek to develop and deploy appropriate tools to  among other things  estimate the comparable expected returns on potential business opportunities  and estimate the impact that such incremental business could have on our overall risk profile 
we use the tools and methods described above in underwriting to seek to achieve these objectives 
aggregate risk profile 
in part through the utilization of rems and our other systems and procedures  we seek to analyze our in force aggregate underwriting portfolio on a daily basis 
we believe this capability  not only helps us to manage our aggregate exposures  but assists our efforts to rigorously analyze individual proposed transactions and evaluate them in the context of our in force portfolio 
this aggregation process captures line of business  segment and corporate risk profiles  calculates internal and external capital tests and explicitly models ceded reinsurance 
generally  additional data is added quarterly to our aggregate risk framework to reflect updated or new information or estimates relating to matters such as interest rate risk  credit risk  capital adequacy and liquidity 
this information is used in day to day decision making for underwriting  investments and operations and is also reviewed quarterly from both a unit level and in respect of our consolidated financial position 
operational risk 
we believe we are subject to a number of additional risks arising out of operational  regulatory  and other matters  which we also seek to actively monitor and manage 
this effort is coordinated by senior personnel including our chief financial officer cfo  general counsel and chief compliance officer cco  corporate controller and chief accounting officer cao  chief administrative officer  chief risk officer cro and internal audit  utilizing resources within the company 
in an effort to identify and reduce operational and regulatory risk  we have significantly enhanced our control environment and have added additional finance  legal and back office resources  to keep pace with the rate of growth experienced by the company and will continue to do so in the future as appropriate 
for example we have developed and expanded the compliance and internal audit functions  the accounting function has been strengthened by the addition of a significant number of professionals  
table of contents accounting  legal and or compliance resources have been placed in our business units to monitor  identify and resolve potential accounting  legal and compliance needs at the operational level  and we have documented accounting guidelines for the review of all non standard reinsurance contracts and other structured and or complex financial transactions 
although financial reporting is a key area of our focus  other operational risks are addressed through our disaster recovery program  human resource practices such as motivating and retaining top talent  and our strict compliance  legal and tax protocols 
controls and compliance committee 
as part of monitoring our risks  we have instituted a controls and compliance committee 
the controls and compliance committee is comprised of our cfo  cco  cao  chief administrative officer  cro  staff compliance function and representatives from our business units 
the controls and compliance committee meets periodically to review and address corporate compliance policies and is charged with monitoring  implementing and educating the company on control and compliance topics and initiatives 
in addition  the controls and compliance committee is charged with reviewing certain transactions that potentially contain complex and or significant underwriting  tax  legal  accounting  regulatory  reputational or compliance issues 
ongoing development and enhancement 
we frequently seek to increase the number of risks we monitor in part through quantitative risk distributions  even where we believe that such quantitative analysis is not as robust or well developed as our tools and models for measuring and evaluating other risks  such as catastrophe and market risks 
we also seek to improve the methods by which we measure risks 
we believe effective risk management is a continual process that requires ongoing improvement and development 
we seek from time to time to identify new best practices or additional developments both from within our industry and from other sectors 
we believe that our ongoing efforts to embed erm throughout our organization are important to our efforts to produce and maintain a competitive advantage to achieve our corporate goals 
our erm is currently rated excellent by s p which is s p s highest erm rating 
geographic breakdown our exposures are generally diversified across geographic zones  but are also a function of market conditions and opportunities 
the company s largest exposure has historically been to the us and caribbean property catastrophe market  which represented of the company s gross premiums written for the year ended december  a significant amount of our us and caribbean premium provides coverage against windstorms  mainly us atlantic hurricanes  as well as earthquakes and other natural and man made catastrophes 
the following table sets forth the percentage of our gross premiums written allocated to the territory of coverage exposure year ended december  gross premiums written percentage of gross premiums written gross premiums written percentage of gross premiums written gross premiums written percentage of gross premiums written in thousands  except percentages property catastrophe reinsurance united states and caribbean worldwide excluding u 
s europe worldwide australia and new zealand other specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total gross premiums written 
table of contents the category worldwide excluding us consists of contracts that cover more than one geographic region other than the us the exposure in this category for gross premiums written to date is predominantly from europe and japan 
the category specialty reinsurance consists of contracts that are predominantly exposed to us and worldwide risks 
excludes million  million and million of premium assumed from our individual risk segment in  and  respectively 
the category individual risk consists of contracts that are primarily exposed to us risks 
reserves for claims and claim expenses claims and claim expense reserves represent estimates  including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell 
we establish our claims and claim expense reserves by taking claims reported to us by insureds and ceding companies  but which have not yet been paid case reserves  adding the costs for additional case reserves additional case reserves which represent our estimates for claims previously reported to us which we believe may not be adequately reserved as of that date  and adding estimates for the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr 
the following table summarizes our claims and claim expense reserves by line of business and split between case reserves  additional case reserves and ibnr at december  and at december  case reserves additional case reserves ibnr total in thousands property catastrophe reinsurance specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total at december  in thousands property catastrophe reinsurance specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total the increase in the total amount of claims and claim expense reserves from december  to december   as shown in the table above  was principally a result of net claims and claim expenses incurred relating to current and prior years of million  including hurricanes gustav and ike which made landfall during the third quarter of  and partially offset by the net payment of claims in respect of current year losses of million  relating primarily to hurricanes gustav and ike and our multi peril crop insurance line of business  and the payment of prior year losses of million  in particular the prior year losses resulting from the large hurricanes of  european windstorm kyrill kyrill  the united kingdom uk flood losses and our specialty unit and individual risk segment losses 
our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves are not precise in that  among other matters  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends and other variable factors 
some  but not all  of our reserves are further subject to the uncertainty inherent in actuarial methodologies and estimates 
because a reserve estimate is simply an insurer s estimate at a point in time of its ultimate liability  and because there are numerous factors which affect reserves and claims payments but cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our 
table of contents estimates of reserves 
if we determine in a subsequent period that adjustments to our previously established reserves are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the twelve months ended december   changes to prior year estimated claims reserves increased our net income or reduced our net loss by million million  million  excluding the consideration of changes in reinstatement premium  profit commissions  minority interest and income tax expense 
our reserving methodology for each line of business uses a loss reserving process that calculates a point estimate for the company s ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims and claim expenses 
we do not calculate a range of estimates 
we use this point estimate  along with paid claims and case reserves  to record our best estimate of additional case reserves and ibnr in our financial statements 
under gaap  we are not permitted to establish estimates for catastrophe claims and claim expense reserves until an event occurs that gives rise to a loss 
reserving for our reinsurance claims involves other uncertainties  such as the dependence on information from ceding companies  which among other matters  includes the time lag inherent in reporting information from the primary insurer to us or to our ceding companies and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
the information received from ceding companies is typically in the form of bordereaux  broker notifications of loss and or discussions with ceding companies or their brokers 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of paid claims and case reserves 
we sometimes also receive an estimate or provision for ibnr 
this information is often updated and adjusted from time to time during the loss settlement period as new data or facts in respect of initial claims  client accounts  industry or event trends may be reported or emerge in addition to changes in applicable statutory and case laws 
included in our results for are million of net claims and claim expenses incurred as a result of losses arising from hurricanes gustav and ike which struck the united states in the third quarter of our estimates of losses from hurricanes gustav and ike  as well as other catastrophe events  are based on factors including currently available information derived from the company s preliminary claims information from certain clients and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models  and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
given the magnitude and recent occurrence of these events  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  several of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates 
in addition  actual losses from these events may increase if our reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations 
our actual losses from these events will likely vary  perhaps materially  from these current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  including the preliminary nature of the available information  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  the effects of any demand surge on claims activity and complex coverage and other legal issues 
included in our results for are million of net claims and claim expenses from kyrill and the uk flood losses which occurred in  as well as million in estimated net losses associated with exposure to sub prime related casualty losses 
estimates of these losses are based on a review of potentially exposed contracts  information reported by and discussions with counterparties  and the company s estimate of losses related to those contracts and are subject to change as more information is reported and becomes available 
such information is frequently reported more slowly  and with less initial accuracy  with respect to non us events such as kyrill and the non us floods than with large us catastrophe losses 
in addition  the sub prime related casualty net claims and claim expenses are based on underlying liability contracts which are considered long tail business  and will therefore take many years before the actual losses are known and reported  which increases the uncertainty with respect to the estimate for ultimate losses for this event 
the net claims and claim expenses from kyrill  the uk floods and sub prime related casualty losses are all attributable to the company s reinsurance segment 
during  we incurred significant losses from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
our estimates of these losses are based on factors including currently available information derived from claims information from our clients and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
in particular  due to the size and unusual complexity of certain legal and 
table of contents claims issues  particularly but not exclusively relating to hurricane katrina  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  our loss estimates 
our actual losses from these events will likely vary  perhaps materially  from our current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  and complex coverage and other legal issues 
because of the inherent uncertainties discussed above  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates  and we have generally experienced favorable development on prior year reserves in the last several years 
however  there is no assurance that this will occur in future periods 
our reserving techniques  assumptions and processes differ between our reinsurance and individual risk segments  as well as between our property catastrophe reinsurance and specialty reinsurance businesses within our reinsurance segment 
refer to our claims and claim expense reserves critical accounting estimates discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information on the risks we insure and reinsure  the reserving techniques  assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves  and our current estimates versus our initial estimates of our claims reserves  for each of these units

investments our investment guidelines stress preservation of capital  market liquidity  and diversification of risk 
the large majority of our investments consist of highly rated fixed income securities 
we also hold a significant amount of short term investments 
short term investments are managed as part of our investment portfolio and have a maturity of one year or less when purchased 
in addition  we have an allocation to other investments  including hedge funds  private equity partnerships  bank loan funds and other investments 
our investments are subject to market wide risks and fluctuations  as well as to risks inherent in particular securities

impact of recent economic and market conditions global financial markets experienced significant stress commencing in the third and fourth quarters of this continued through most of  accelerated in the fourth quarter of and has continued into initially driven in the third and fourth quarters of by challenging conditions in markets related to us sub prime mortgages including cdos based on sub prime collateral  and in the markets for 
table of contents loans and bonds related to leveraged finance transactions collectively referred to as sub prime  additional dislocations developed further during and impacted the global credit and capital related markets  including  but not limited to a significant diminishment in the liquidity of credit markets  resulting in significantly decreased availability for many companies to sources of liquidity such as the commercial paper market  the asset securitization market and commercial and corporate lending by banks  the failure of financial institutions  most notably  lehman brothers holdings inc lehman brothers  and government interventions in others such as the federal national mortgage association fannie mae  the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and aig  the bernard l 
madoff investment securities llc madoff matter  and the continuing decline in securities markets  depressed asset values and deteriorated economic strength of many companies and industries 
the resulting adverse market environment has been characterized by significant credit spread widening  prolonged illiquidity  reduced price transparency and increased volatility 
as conditions in these markets deteriorated  other areas such as the asset backed commercial paper market also experienced decreased liquidity and the equity markets experienced short term weakness and increased volatility 
in response and in an effort to stabilize market conditions generally  the federal reserve and other central banks injected significant liquidity into the markets and lowered benchmark interest rates 
on october   then president bush signed into law the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa  giving the us treasury the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgage backed and other securities from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets 
subsequently  on february   president obama signed into law the american recovery and reinvestment act of the arra  a billion stimulus bill for the purpose of stabilizing the economy by  among other things  creating jobs 
it is possible that the continued deterioration in the credit and capital markets noted above will continue to significantly adversely impact the overall economy  which could directly or indirectly give rise to adverse impacts on us  potentially including impacts we cannot currently reasonably foresee 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any of the governmental or private sector initiatives designed to address such credit deterioration in the markets will be implemented  or that if implemented would be successful 
we believe that the company is currently principally exposed to credit and capital market dislocations noted above  through its investment portfolio and underwriting portfolio  and through its investments in ventures accounted for under the equity method 
following is a summary of our current estimates relating to these exposures 
investments 
at december   the company had nil positions in fixed income securities backed by sub prime loan collateral within its portfolio of fixed maturity investments available for sale and short term investments 
the company s investment guidelines and or standing orders prohibit our fixed income investment managers from investing in securities supported by sub prime collateral 
in addition  our guidelines require that all securitized assets in our portfolio of fixed maturity investments available for sale be aaa rated and prohibit investments in cdos  collateralized loan obligations clos and home equity loans as well as fixed income investments where the credit rating is backed by a financial guaranty company 
at december   we had million in private equity investments and million in hedge fund investments 
our private equity and hedge funds investments are generally managed by diversified managers who we currently do not believe are over exposed to any one sector 
within our private equity portfolio  we may have exposure to sub prime through underlying portfolio investments  such as financial institutions  which have been impacted by sub prime 
our hedge fund managers independently direct and control the underlying investments and positions of such funds  and it is possible that through these funds we have more indirect exposure to sub prime developments than we have currently estimated  or that such exposure may increase in future periods 
overall  we estimate that our exposure to sub prime in our portfolio of hedge funds and private equity investments is minimal as of december  
table of contents while our current positions in sub prime within our portfolio of fixed maturity investments available for sale is nil  and we believe our exposure within our hedge fund and private equity portfolio is limited  we may amend our investment guidelines in future periods and may elect to assume exposure to these or other more risky asset classes if we believe the potential return sufficiently compensate us for the risk being assumed  and our overall capital and liquidity position supports such actions 
during the year ended december   the company recorded million million  million in other than temporary impairment charges including credit related impairment charges of million nil  million 
the significant increase in other than temporary impairment charges is primarily the result of widening credit spreads during due to the turmoil in the credit and capital markets noted above 
the credit related other than temporary impairment charges during of million include impairments for which the company believes it will not be able to recover the full principal amount if the impaired security is held to maturity  and were principally driven by the company s direct holdings of fixed maturity securities issued by lehman brothers 
as of december   the company had essentially no fixed maturity investments available for sale in an unrealized loss position 
underwriting portfolio 
the company s reinsurance portfolio is exposed to risks relating to claims against financial institutions and other organizations involved in the underwriting  soliciting  documentation  collateralization  brokering  marketing  rating or purchase of  among other things  sub prime mortgages including through derivative instruments 
we believe that the ongoing market turmoil in the us  originally manifested in perceived potential losses arising out of sub prime exposures  will likely have an effect on other lines in the insurance industry  such as directors officers d o  errors omissions e o and other professional lines coverage 
shareholder actions have been filed in the marketplace relating to  among other things  omitting disclosure of investment exposure to failing institutions such as lehman brothers  breach of fiduciary duties of care in hastily agreeing to the acquisitions of the bear stearns companies inc bear stearns  merrill lynch co 
inc 
and wachovia corporation  and allegedly grossly imprudent risk taking in the subprime lending market by aig 
in addition  several entities  including fannie mae  freddie mac  lehman brothers  aig  countrywide financial corporation  ubs ag  bear stearns and others are the subject of one or more investigations by the sec  the federal bureau of investigations and or various other regulatory bodies or enforcement agencies 
moreover  in the fourth quarter of  it was purported that madoff was a part of the largest ponzi scheme in history 
we expect there to be further actions with varying theories of liability in the foreseeable future 
it appears that a large number of professional service firms could be affected across the lines noted above 
our casualty clash book of business  within the specialty unit of our reinsurance segment  has  or could have  exposure under various purported theories of liability  particularly arising from the d o and e o market 
our estimate of these losses at december  is million  an increase of million from our december  estimate  with the majority of the increase relating to potential exposures arising out of the madoff matter which was discovered in the fourth quarter of these losses are included in our reinsurance segment results 
in addition  our specialty unit has exposure to risks relating to the decrease in home demand through our surety book of business  which could lead to delays and defaults in projects  and could cause additional losses  although we currently believe we have no sub prime related losses in our surety book of business 
investments in other ventures under equity method 
during  channelre suffered a significant net loss which reduced channelre s gaap shareholders equity below nil 
the net loss was driven by unrealized mark to market losses related to financial guaranty contracts accounted for as derivatives under gaap 
as a result  the company reduced its carried value in channelre to nil which negatively impacted our net income by million in as a result of reducing our carried value in channelre to nil  combined with the fact that we have no further contractual obligations to provide capital or other support to channelre  we believe we currently have no further negative economic exposure to channelre 
since channelre remained in a negative shareholders equity position during  our investment in channelre continues to be carried at nil 
it is possible that with the adoption of fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements fas by channelre in  that in future periods the nonperformance risk or own credit risk portion of channelre s mark to market on its financial guaranty contracts accounted for as derivatives under gaap may increase  or that the underlying mark to market on channelre s financial guaranty contracts accounted for as derivatives under gaap may decrease  or both  which could result in 
table of contents channelre returning to a positive equity position  at which time we would then record our share of channelre s net income  subject to impairment  or our share of channelre s net loss 
during the fourth quarter of  we invested million in the preferred equity of aladdin credit products ltd 
aladdin 
aladdin was established to provide credit protection on fixed income securities in return for a premium 
due to adverse market conditions  aladdin elected to not write any business and subsequently announced during the fourth quarter of that it would wind up its operations and return the residual capital to shareholders 
the company expects to receive the majority of its original investment  less certain administrative expenses incurred 
at december   the company recorded a receivable of million in other assets for the expected liquidation value of aladdin 
during january  the company received an initial payout of million with the final distribution expected to be received during the second quarter of marketing reinsurance we believe that our modeling and technical expertise  the risk management advice that we provide to our clients  and our reputation for paying claims promptly has enabled us to become a provider of first choice in many lines of business to our customers worldwide 
we market our reinsurance products worldwide exclusively through reinsurance brokers and we focus our marketing efforts on targeted brokers 
we believe that our existing portfolio of business is a valuable asset and  therefore  we attempt to continually strengthen relationships with our existing brokers and clients 
we target prospects that are capable of supplying detailed and accurate underwriting data and that potentially add further diversification to our book of business 
we believe that primary insurers and brokers willingness to use a particular reinsurer is based not just on pricing  but also on the financial security of the reinsurer  its claim paying ability ratings and demonstrated willingness to promptly pay valid claims  the quality of a reinsurer s service  the reinsurer s willingness and ability to design customized programs  its long term stability and its commitment to provide reinsurance capacity 
we believe we have established a reputation with our brokers and clients for prompt response on underwriting submissions  fast claims payments and a reputation for providing creative solutions to our customers needs 
since we selectively write large lines on a limited number of property catastrophe reinsurance contracts  we can establish reinsurance terms and conditions on those contracts that are attractive in our judgment  make large commitments to the most attractive programs and provide superior client responsiveness 
we believe that our willingness and ability to design customized programs and to provide advice on catastrophe risk management has helped us to develop long term relationships with brokers and clients 

table of contents our reinsurance brokers assess client needs and perform data collection  contract preparation and other administrative tasks  enabling us to market our reinsurance products cost effectively by maintaining a smaller staff 
we believe that by maintaining close relationships with brokers  we are able to obtain access to a broad range of potential reinsureds 
in recent years  our distribution has become increasingly reliant on a small number of such relationships  a trend which we believe has been accelerated by the merger of aon and benfield 
we expect this concentration to continue and perhaps increase

our financial security ratings  combined with our reputation in the reinsurance marketplace  including the long standing relationships we have developed with our reinsurance intermediaries  have enhanced our presence in our individual risk markets

we believe that our existing third party program managers are an important source of referrals and endorsements of our approach to this business 
in addition  we acquired the net assets of agro national  llc in june  a managing general underwriter of multi peril crop insurance  which is now a wholly owned program manager presenting additional opportunities in our individual risk markets 
our broker produced business is principally written on an excess and surplus lines basis by glencoe and lantana on a risk by risk basis 
this business is generally submitted to us through licensed surplus lines brokers who are generally responsible for regulatory compliance  premium tax collection and certain other matters associated with policy placement 
new business for information related to new business  refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
employees at february   we and our subsidiaries employed approximately people worldwide february  people  february  people 
we believe our strong employee relations are among our most significant strengths 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
we are not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements at any of our subsidiaries 
historically  the company has looked for opportunities to strengthen its operations during periods of softening markets in preparation for improving market conditions 
as noted above  the company added approximately employees year over year  primarily driven by its asset acquisitions of agro national  llc and cms 
in addition  the company added resources in  among others  its accounting and legal functions  as well as certain of its current and expected future business units 
we believe that our employee headcount is likely to continue to increase over time as the company expands geographically  and seeks to enter new lines of business 
we expect that our employee growth in the us and other highly regulated markets will increase our operating and compliance complexity and expenses  although we do not expect these increases to be material to the company as a whole 
information technology our information technology infrastructure is important to our business 
our information technology platform  supported by a team of professionals  is currently principally located in our corporate headquarters and principal corporate offices in bermuda 
additional information technology assets are maintained at the office locations of our operating subsidiaries 
we have implemented backup procedures that seek to ensure that our key business systems and data are backed up  generally on a daily basis  and can be restored promptly if and as needed 
in addition  we generally store backup information at off site locations  in order to seek to minimize our risk of loss of key data in the event of a disaster 
we have implemented and periodically test our disaster recovery plans with respect to our information technology infrastructure 
among other things  our recovery plans involve arrangements with off site  secure data centers in alternative locations 
we believe we will be able to access our systems from these facilities in the event that our primary systems are unavailable due to a scenario such as a natural disaster 
regulation us regulation reinsurance regulation 
our bermuda domiciled insurance operations and joint ventures principally consist of renaissance reinsurance  davinci  glencoe and lantana 
renaissance reinsurance  davinci and top layer re are bermuda based companies that operate as reinsurers 
although none of these companies is admitted to transact the business of insurance in any jurisdiction except bermuda  the insurance laws of each state of the us regulate the sale of reinsurance to ceding insurers authorized in the state by non admitted alien reinsurers  such as renaissance reinsurance or davinci  acting from locations outside the state 
rates  contract terms and conditions of reinsurance agreements generally are not subject 
table of contents to regulation by any governmental authority 
a primary insurer ordinarily will enter into a reinsurance agreement  however  only if it can obtain credit for the reinsurance ceded on its statutory financial statements 
in general  regulators permit ceding insurers to take credit for reinsurance under the following circumstances if the contract contains certain minimum provisions if the reinsurer is licensed or accredited  if the reinsurer is domiciled in a state with substantially similar regulatory requirements as the primary insurer s domiciliary jurisdiction and meets certain financial requirements  or if the reinsurance obligations are collateralized appropriately 
as alien companies  our bermuda subsidiaries collateralize their reinsurance obligations to us insurance companies 
with some exceptions  the sale of insurance or reinsurance within a jurisdiction where the insurer is not admitted to do business is prohibited 
neither renaissance reinsurance nor davinci intends to maintain an office or to solicit  advertise  settle claims or conduct other insurance activities in any jurisdiction  other than bermuda  where the conduct of such activities would require that each company be so admitted 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic adopted a framework to modernize the current us reinsurance regulatory framework  with implementation details to follow 
the framework contemplates the creation of the naic reinsurance supervision review department rsrd to analyze foreign regulatory regimes for functional equivalence with us jurisdictions and a port of entry certification process to allow a non us reinsurer from an rsrd approved jurisdiction to enter the us reinsurance market through a single state 
the framework contemplates credit for reinsurance collateral levels from to based on the ratings assigned to reinsurers 
accordingly  the framework may lead to a reduction of the collateral requirements for non us reinsurers  which could be beneficial to our bermuda subsidiaries 
certain individual states have moved forward with initiatives for similar revised collateral requirements as well 
at this time  we are unable to determine how such changes in the us reinsurance regulatory framework will be implemented and the effect  if any  such changes would have on our operations or financial condition 
excess and surplus lines regulation 
glencoe and lantana  domiciled in bermuda  are not licensed in the us but are eligible to offer coverage in the us exclusively in the surplus lines market 
glencoe and lantana are eligible to write surplus lines primary insurance in and jurisdictions of the us  respectively  and each is subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which it is eligible to write surplus lines primary insurance 
in accordance with certain provisions of the naic nonadmitted insurance model act  which provisions have been adopted by a number of states  glencoe and lantana have each established  and are required to maintain  a trust funded to a minimum amount as a condition of its status as an eligible  non admitted insurer in the us although surplus lines business is generally less regulated than the admitted market  strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements under the laws of every state  and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future 
federal and or state measures may be introduced and promulgated that would result in increased oversight and regulation of surplus lines insurance 
additionally  some recent and pending cases in florida and california courts have raised potentially significant questions regarding surplus lines insurance in those states such as whether surplus lines insurers will be subject to policy form content  filing and approval requirements or additional taxes 
these cases also could foreshadow more extensive oversight of surplus lines insurance by other jurisdictions 
any increase in our regulatory burden may impact our operations and ultimately could impact our financial condition as well 
admitted market regulation 
our admitted us insurance company operations currently consist of stonington and stonington lloyds  both texas domiciled insurers 
stonington is licensed to write primary insurance in states and the district of columbia 
stonington lloyds is a texas lloyds company licensed to write primary insurance in texas 
stonington acts as an attorney in fact for stonington lloyds 
as licensed insurers operating in the admitted market  these companies are subject to extensive regulation 
the extent of regulation varies from state to state but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative authority to a department of insurance in each state 
among other things  state insurance statutes require insurance companies to file financial statements  conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and regulate insurer solvency standards  insurer licensing  authorized investments  premium rates  restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy  loss and expense reserves and provisions for unearned premiums  deposits of 
table of contents securities for the benefit of policyholders  policy form approval  policy renewals and non renewals  and market conduct regulation including both underwriting and claims practices 
licensed us insurers are required to participate in various state residual market mechanisms whose goal is to provide affordability and availability of insurance to those consumers who may not otherwise be able to obtain insurance 
the mechanics of how each state s residual markets operate may differ  but generally  risks are either assigned to various private carriers or the state manages the risk through a pooling arrangement 
if losses exceed the funds the pool has available to pay those losses  the pools have the ability to assess insurers to provide additional funds to the pool 
the amounts of the assessment for each company are normally based upon the proportion of each insurer s and in some cases the insurer s and its affiliates written premium for coverages similar to those provided by the pool  and are frequently uncapped 
state guaranty associations also have the ability to assess licensed us insurers in order to provide funds for payment of losses for insurers which have become insolvent 
in many cases  but not all  assessed insurers may recoup the amount of these guaranty fund and state pool assessments by surcharging future policyholders 
holding company regulation 
we and our us insurance company subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws of various jurisdictions 
the insurance holding company laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  but generally require an insurance holding company  and insurers that are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies  to register with state regulatory authorities and to file with those authorities certain reports  including information concerning their capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain intercompany transactions and general business operations 
in addition  under the terms of applicable state statutes  any person or entity obtaining beneficial ownership of with certain limited exceptions or more of our outstanding voting securities is required to apply for and receive prior regulatory approval for such acquisition  and our us insurance company subsidiaries are required to report ownership changes to their domiciliary regulator 
further  in order to protect insurance company solvency  state insurance statutes typically place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable to affiliates by insurance companies 
naic ratios 
the naic has established financial ratios to assist state insurance departments in their oversight of the financial condition of licensed us insurance companies operating in their respective states 
the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris calculates these ratios based on information submitted by insurers on an annual basis and shares the information with the applicable state insurance departments 
each ratio has an established usual range of results and assists state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies 
a ratio result falling outside the usual range of iris ratios is not considered a failing result  rather unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system 
furthermore  in some years  it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges 
an insurance company may fall out of the usual range for one or more ratios because of specific transactions that are in themselves immaterial 
generally  an insurance company will be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny if it falls outside the usual ranges with respect to four or more of the ratios 
risk based capital 
the naic has implemented a risk based capital rbc formula and model law applicable to all licensed us property casualty insurance companies 
the rbc formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business 
such analysis permits regulators to identify inadequately capitalized insurers 
the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of statutory capital by applying certain factors to insurers business risks such as asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk and off balance sheet risk 
the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a result of the insurer s size  but also on the risk profile of the insurer s operations 
insurers that have less statutory capital than the rbc calculation requires are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level of capital inadequacy 
the rbc formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with higher levels of capital 
therefore  it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank such companies 
legislative and regulatory proposals 
government intervention in the insurance and reinsurance markets in the us continues to evolve 
although us state regulation is the primary form of regulation of insurance 
table of contents and reinsurance  congress has considered over the past year various proposals relating to potential surplus lines regulation  reinsurance regulation  the creation of an optional federal charter  the creation of a systemic risk regulator  and tax law changes  including changes to increase the taxation of reinsurance premiums paid to affiliates with respect to us risks 
none of these proposals were adopted by the th congress before it adjourned 
additionally  some members of the us house of representatives have called for the recently appointed treasury secretary unilaterally to create an insurance oversight office within the treasury department or assign a high level treasury department appointee with insurance duties to provide oversight and expertise at the federal level and provide policymakers with insight into issues regarding the insurance market as reform is contemplated 
although we are unable to predict what new laws and regulations will be proposed in the th congress  whether any such proposed laws and regulations will be adopted  or the form in which any such laws and regulations would be adopted  we believe it is more likely than at times in the past that the current congress will adopt laws and or regulations with respect to insurance  and we anticipate that these developments will impact our operations and also could impact our financial condition 
in addition to potential new insurance industry regulation  the obama administration and congress are also considering various regulatory reforms for the financial markets  including potentially as it pertains to the re insurance industry 
we are unable to predict what reforms will be proposed or adopted or the effect  if any  that such reforms would have on our operations and financial condition 
we are carefully monitoring such developments 
in  florida enacted legislation which enabled the florida hurricane catastrophe fund to offer increased amounts of coverage in addition to the mandatory coverage amount  at below market rates 
further  the legislation expanded the ability of the state sponsored insurer  citizens  to compete with private insurance companies  such as ours and other companies that cede business to us 
this legislation reduced the role of the private insurance and reinsurance markets in florida  a key target market of ours 
efforts in to partially reduce this expansion of state participation in the market did not succeed 
the property insurance market in florida remains unstable  with participants  both public and private  continuing to evaluate and seek a variety of possible initiatives 
due to our position as one of the largest providers of catastrophe exposed coverage  both on a global basis  and in respect to the florida market  recent and future legislative and regulatory changes in florida may have a disproportionate impact on us compared to other market participants 
it is also possible that other states  particularly those with atlantic or gulf coast exposures  may enact new or expanded legislation based on some version of the florida precedent  which would further diminish aggregate private market demand for our products 
moreover  there were several federal bills proposed in the th congress which included a federal reinsurance backstop mechanism for catastrophic type natural disasters which were too large for state catastrophe funds to absorb 
we believe these bills  or some version of them  are likely to be proposed in the th congress 
although we believe such legislation will be vigorously opposed  if enacted  these bills would likely further erode the role of private market catastrophe reinsurers 
the potential for further expansion into additional insurance markets  could expose us or our subsidiaries to increasing regulatory oversight  including the oversight of countries other than bermuda and the us however  we intend to continue to conduct our operations so as to minimize the likelihood that renaissance reinsurance  davinci  top layer re  glencoe  lantana  or any of our other bermudian subsidiaries will become subject to direct us regulation 
in addition  as discussed above  rim and rtl are involved in certain commodities trading activities relating to weather  natural gas  heating oil  power  crude oil  agricultural commodities and cross commodity structures 
while rim s and rtl s operations currently are not subject to significant federal oversight  we are monitoring carefully new or revised legislation or regulation in the united states or otherwise  which could increase the regulatory burden and operating expenses of these operations 
bermuda regulation all bermuda companies must comply with the provisions of the companies act in addition  the insurance act insurance act regulates the business of our bermuda insurance and management company subsidiaries 

table of contents as a holding company  renaissancere is not subject to the insurance act 
however  the insurance act regulates the insurance and reinsurance business of our operating insurance companies 
the company s most significant operating subsidiaries include renaissance reinsurance and davinci which are registered as class insurers and glencoe  lantana  and top layer re which are registered as class insurers 
rum is registered as an insurance manager 
the insurance act imposes solvency and liquidity standards as well as auditing and reporting requirements and confers on the bermuda monetary authority bma powers to supervise  investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies 
significant requirements of the insurance act include the appointment of an independent auditor and loss reserve specialist both of whom must be approved by the bma  the filing of an annual financial return and provisions relating to the payment of distributions and dividends 
in particular an insurer must prepare annual statutory financial statements which must be submitted as part of its statutory financial return no later than four months after the insurer s financial year end unless specifically extended 
the annual statutory financial statements give detailed information and analyses regarding premiums  claims  reinsurance  reserves and investments 
the statutory financial return includes  among other items  a report of the approved independent auditor on the statutory financial statements  a declaration of statutory ratios  a solvency certificate  the statutory financial statements themselves  the opinion of the approved loss reserve specialist and  in the case of class insurers  details concerning ceded reinsurance 
the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return do not form part of the public records maintained by the bma 
in addition to preparing statutory financial statements  effective december   all class insurers must prepare financial statements in respect of their insurance business in accordance with generally accepted insurance principles or international financial reporting standards 
an insurer s statutory assets must exceed its statutory liabilities by an amount greater than the prescribed minimum solvency margin which varies with the category of its registration and net premiums written and loss reserves posted minimum solvency margin 
the minimum solvency margin that must be maintained by a class insurer is the greater of i million  or ii of net premiums written with a credit for reinsurance ceded not exceeding of gross premiums or iii of net discounted aggregate loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves 
the minimum solvency margin for a class insurer is the greater of i million  or ii of the first million of net premiums written  if in excess of million  the figure is million plus of net premiums written in excess of million  or iii of net discounted aggregate loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves 
an insurer engaged in general business is required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than of the amount of its relevant liabilities minimum liquidity ratio 
both class and class insurers are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends if in breach of the required minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio the relevant margins or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause the insurer to fail to meet the relevant margins 
where an insurer fails to meet its relevant margins on the last day of any financial year  it is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year without the prior approval of the bma 
further  a class insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than of its total statutory capital and surplus as shown on its previous financial year s statutory balance sheet unless it files at least seven days before payment of such dividends with the bma an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet its relevant margins 
class and class insurers must obtain the bma s prior approval for a reduction by or more of the total statutory capital as set forth in its previous year s financial statements 
these restrictions on declaring or paying dividends and distributions under the insurance act are in addition to the solvency requirements under the companies act which apply to all bermuda companies 
if the bma believes that an investigation is required in the interests of an insurer s policyholders or persons who may become policyholders  it may appoint an inspector who has extensive powers of investigation 
if it appears to the bma to be desirable in the interests of policyholders  the bma may also exercise these powers in relation to holding companies  subsidiaries and other affiliates of insurers 

table of contents if it appears to the bma that there is a risk of an insurer becoming insolvent  or that insurer is in breach of the insurance act or any conditions of its registration  the bma may exercise extensive powers of intervention including directing the insurer not to take on any new insurance business or prohibiting the company from declaring and paying dividends or other distributions 
any person who  directly or indirectly  becomes a holder of at least   or of the voting shares of an insurer must notify the bma of its holdings 
where it appears to the bma that a person who is a controller of any description of a registered person is not or is no longer a fit and proper person to be such a controller  it may serve him with a written notice of objection to his being such a controller of the registered person 
under the provisions of the insurance act  the bma may  from time to time  conduct on site visits at the offices of insurers it regulates 
the insurance act was amended in by the introduction  among other things  of the bermuda solvency capital requirement the bscr which is a standard mathematical model designed to give the bma more advanced methods for determining an insurer s capital adequacy 
where insurers apply in house models that deal more effectively with their own particular risks and where such models satisfy the standards established by the bma  such insurers may apply to the bma to use such models in lieu of the bscr 
underlying the bscr is the belief that all insurers should operate on an ongoing basis with a view to maintaining their capital at a prudent level in excess of the minimum solvency margin otherwise prescribed under the insurance act 
effective december   all class insurers must maintain their capital at a target level which is set at of the minimum amount calculated in accordance with the bscr or the company s approved in house model the enhanced capital requirement or ecr 
in circumstances where the bma concludes that the company s risk profile deviates significantly from the assumptions underlying the ecr or the company s assessment of its management policies and practices  it may issue an order requiring that the company adjust its ecr 
in addition to introducing the bscr  the legislation referenced above also provided that all class insurers submit a re classification application to the bma by december  under the new classification criteria  all class companies are now classified as a class  a class a small commercial insurer or a class b large commercial insurer 
of the company s class insurers  glencoe  lantana and top layer re have applied to be re classified as class a s 
it is anticipated that a number of the regulatory and supervisory requirements currently applicable to class insurers including the bscr discussed above will ultimately be extended to the new class b s 
the regulatory regime applicable to the new class a s and class s is expected to remain largely unchanged

table of contents item a 
risk factors factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements contained in this form k and other documents we file with the sec include the following risks related to our company our exposure to catastrophic events and other exposures that we cover could cause our financial results to vary significantly from one period to the next 
our largest product based on total gross premiums written is property catastrophe reinsurance 
we also sell lines of specialty reinsurance and certain individual risk products that are exposed to catastrophe risk 
we therefore have a large overall exposure to natural and man made disasters  such as earthquakes  hurricanes  tsunamis  winter storms  freezes  floods  fires  tornados  hailstorms  drought and other natural or man made disasters  such as acts of terrorism 
as a result  our operating results have historically been  and we expect will continue to be  significantly affected by relatively few events of large magnitude 
we expect claims from catastrophic events to cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year  moreover  catastrophic claims could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our ability to write new business could also be affected 
we believe that increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property  particularly along coastal regions  and the effects of inflation may continue to increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future 
from time to time  we expect to have greater exposures in one or more specific geographic areas than our overall share of the worldwide market would unilaterally suggest 
accordingly  when and if catastrophes occur in these areas  we may experience relatively more severe net negative impacts from such events than our competitors 
in particular  the company has historically had a relatively large percentage of its coverage exposures concentrated in the state of florida 
we may fail to execute our strategy  which would impair our future financial results 
historically  our principal product has been property catastrophe reinsurance 
as we have expanded and continue to expand into other lines of business  we have been and will be presented with new and expanded challenges and risks which we may not manage successfully 
businesses in early stages of development present substantial business  financial and operational risks and may suffer significant losses 
for example  our current and potential future expansion may require us to develop new client and customer relationships  supplement existing or build new operating procedures  hire staff  develop and install management information and other systems  as well as take numerous other steps to implement our strategies 
if we fail to continue to develop the necessary infrastructure  or otherwise fail to execute our strategy  our results from these newer lines of business will likely suffer  perhaps substantially  and our future financial results may be adversely affected 
in addition  our expansion into newer lines of business may place increased demands on our financial  managerial and human resources 
for example  we may need to attract additional professionals  and to the extent we are unable to attract such additional professionals  our existing financial  managerial and human resources may be strained 
our future profitability depends in part on our ability to further develop our resources and effectively manage expansion  and our inability to do so may impair our future financial results 
a decline in the ratings assigned to our financial strength may adversely impact our business  perhaps materially so 
third party rating agencies assess and rate the financial strength of reinsurers and insurers  such as renaissance reinsurance and certain of our other operating subsidiaries and joint ventures 
these ratings are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies 
periodically  the rating agencies evaluate us and may downgrade or withdraw their financial strength ratings in the future if we do not continue to meet the criteria of the ratings previously assigned to us 
the financial strength ratings assigned by rating agencies to reinsurance or insurance companies are based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward the protection of investors 

table of contents these ratings are subject to periodic review and may be revised or revoked  by the agencies which issue them 
in addition  from time to time one or more ratings agencies have effected changes in their capital models and rating methodologies  which have generally served to increase the amounts of capital required to support the ratings  and it is possible that legislation arising as a result of the ongoing financial crisis may result in additional changes 
negative ratings actions in the future could have an adverse effect on our ability to fully realize the market opportunities we currently expect to participate in 
in addition  it is increasingly common for our reinsurance contracts to contain provisions permitting our clients to cancel coverage pro rata if our relevant operating subsidiary is downgraded below a certain rating level 
whether a client would exercise this right would depend  among other factors  on the reason for such a downgrade  the extent of the downgrade  the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage 
therefore  in the event of a downgrade  it is not possible to predict in advance the extent to which this cancellation right would be exercised  if at all  or what effect such cancellations would have on our financial condition or future operations  but such effect potentially could be material 
to date  we are not aware that we have experienced such a cancellation 
our ability to compete with other reinsurers and insurers  and our results of operations  could be materially adversely affected by any such ratings downgrade 
for example  following a ratings downgrade we might lose clients to more highly rated competitors or retain a lower share of the business of our clients 
for the current ratings of certain of our subsidiaries and joint ventures  refer to item business ratings 
because we depend on a few insurance and reinsurance brokers in our reinsurance segment and several third party program managers in our individual risk segment for a large portion of revenue  loss of business provided by them could adversely affect us 
our reinsurance business markets insurance and reinsurance products worldwide exclusively through insurance and reinsurance brokers 
four brokerage firms accounted for of our reinsurance segment gross premiums written for the year ended december  subsidiaries and affiliates of the benfield  marsh inc  aon and the willis group accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our reinsurance segment gross premiums written in as noted above  in aon acquired benfield resulting in the combined entity accounting for of our reinsurance segment gross premiums written in our individual risk business markets a significant portion of its insurance and reinsurance products through third party program managers 
in recent years  our individual risk and reinsurance segments have experienced increased concentration of production from a smaller number of intermediaries 
third party program managers accounted for of our individual risk segment gross premiums written for the year ended december  the loss of a substantial portion of the business provided by our brokers and or third party program managers would have a material adverse effect on us 
our ability to market our products could decline as a result of any loss of the business provided by these brokers and or third party program managers and it is possible that our premiums written would decrease 
our utilization of brokers  third party program managers and other third parties to support our business exposes us to operational and financial risks 
our individual risk operations rely on third party program managers  and other agents and brokers participating in our programs  to produce and service a substantial portion of our operations in this segment 
in these arrangements  we typically grant the program manager the right to bind us to newly issued and renewal insurance policies  subject to underwriting guidelines we provide and other contractual restrictions and obligations 
should our third party program managers issue policies that contravene these guidelines  restrictions or obligations  we could nonetheless be deemed liable for such policies 
although we would intend to resist claims that exceed or expand on our underwriting intention  it is possible that we would not prevail in such an action  or that our program manager would be unable to substantially indemnify us for their contractual breach 
we also rely on our third party program managers  third party 
table of contents administrators or other third parties we retain  to collect premiums and to pay valid claims 
we could also be exposed to the program manager s or their producer s operational risk  for example  but not limited to  contract wording errors  technological and staffing deficiencies and inadequate disaster recovery plans 
we could also be exposed to potential liabilities relating to the claims practices of the third party administrators we have retained to manage substantially all of the claims activity that we expect to arise in our individual risk operations 
although we have implemented monitoring and other oversight protocols  we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to mitigate all of these exposures 
we are also subject to the risk that our successful third party program managers will not renew their programs with us 
although our contracts are generally not for defined terms  generally  either party can cancel the contract in a relatively short period of time 
while we believe our arrangements offer numerous benefits to our program participants  we cannot assure you we will retain the programs that produce profitable business or that our insureds will renew with us 
failure to retain or replace the third party program managers  or the program manager s failure to retain or replace their producers  would impair our ability to execute our growth strategy  and our financial results could be adversely affected 
with respect to our reinsurance operations we do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under our reinsurance contracts and  accordingly  like other reinsurers  are heavily dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by our ceding companies 
we are therefore subject to the risk that our clients may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured  or that the premiums ceded to us will not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume  perhaps materially so 
our claims and claim expense reserves are subject to inherent uncertainties 
our claims and claim expense reserves reflect our estimates using actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred 
although we use actuarial and computer models as well as historical reinsurance and insurance industry loss statistics  we also rely heavily on management s experience and judgment to assist in the establishment of appropriate claims and claim expense reserves 
however  because of the many assumptions and estimates involved in establishing reserves  the reserving process is inherently uncertain 
our estimates and judgments are based on numerous factors  and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed  as new or improved methodologies are developed  as loss trends and claims inflation impact future payments  or as current laws or interpretations thereof change 
our specialty reinsurance and individual risk operations are expected to produce claims which at times can only be resolved through lengthy and unpredictable litigation 
the measures required to resolve such claims  including the adjudication process  present more reserve challenges than property losses which tend to be reported comparatively more promptly and to be settled within a relatively shorter period of time 
actual net claims and claim expenses paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
we expect that some of our assumptions or estimates will prove to be inaccurate  and that our actual net claims and claim expenses paid will differ  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
to the extent that our actual claims and claim expenses exceed our expectations  we would be required to increase claims and claim expense reserves 
this would reduce our net income by a corresponding amount in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
to the extent that our actual claims and claim expenses are lower than our expectations  we would be required to decrease claims and claim expense reserves and this would increase our net income 
estimates of losses are based on a review of potentially exposed contracts  information reported by and discussions with counterparties  and our estimate of losses related to those contracts and are subject to change as more information is reported and becomes available 
as an example  included in our results for are million of net claims and claim expenses arising from hurricanes gustav and ike which struck the united states in the third quarter of our estimates of losses from catastrophic events  such as hurricanes gustav and ike  and the hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  are based on factors including currently available information derived from the company s 
table of contents preliminary claims information from certain clients and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models  and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
due to the size and unusual complexity of the legal and claims issues relating to these events  particularly hurricanes katrina and ike  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  several of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates 
in addition  actual losses from these events may increase if our reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations to us 
our actual losses from these events will likely vary  perhaps materially  from these current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  including the nature of the available information  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  the effects of any demand surge on claims activity and complex coverage and other legal issues 
unlike the loss reserves of us insurers  the loss reserves of our bermuda licensed insurers  including renaissance reinsurance  davinci and glencoe  are not regularly examined by insurance regulators  although  as registered bermuda insurers  we are required to submit opinions of our approved loss reserve specialist with the annual statutory financial returns of our bermuda licensed insurers with regard to their respective loss and loss expenses provisions 
the loss reserve specialist  who will normally be a qualified actuary  must be approved by the bma 
the emergence of matters which may impact certain of our coverages  such as the asserted trend toward potentially significant global warming and the ongoing financial crisis  could cause us to underestimate our exposures and potentially adversely impact our financial results  perhaps significantly 
in our reinsurance business  we use analytic and modeling capabilities that help us to assess the risk and return of each reinsurance contract in relation to our overall portfolio of reinsurance contracts 
for catastrophe exposed business in our individual risk segment  we also seek to utilize proprietary modeling tools that have been developed in conjunction with the modeling and other resources utilized in our reinsurance operations 
see item business underwriting and enterprise risk management 
in general  our techniques for evaluating catastrophe risk are much better developed than those for other classes of risk in businesses that we have entered into recently or may enter into in the future 
our models and databases may not accurately address the emergence of a variety of matters which might be deemed to impact certain of our coverages 
accordingly  our models may understate the exposures we are assuming and our financial results may be adversely impacted  perhaps significantly 
we believe  and recent scientific studies have indicated  that climate conditions  primarily global temperatures  may be increasing  which may in the future increase the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes relative to the historical experience over the past years as well as the losses resulting there from 
we continuously monitor and adjust  as we believe appropriate  our risk management models to reflect our judgment of how to interpret current developments and information  such as these studies 
however  it is possible that  even after these adjustments  we have underestimated the frequency or severity of hurricanes or other catastrophes 
changing weather patterns and climatic conditions  such as global warming  may have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters in some parts of the world and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures 
our specialty reinsurance portfolio is also exposed to emerging risks arising from the ongoing financial crisis  including with respect to a potential increase of claims in d o  e o  mortgage valuation  surety  casualty clash and other lines of business 
a sustained weakness or weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we do business could adversely affect our business and operating results 
the united states and other markets around the world have been experiencing deteriorating economic conditions  including substantial and continuing financial market disruptions 
continued adverse development in economic conditions could adversely affect the business environment in our principal markets  and accordingly could adversely affect demand for the products sold by us or our clients 
in addition  during an economic downturn  our consolidated credit risk  reflecting our counterparty dealings 
table of contents with agents  brokers  customers  retrocessionaires  capital providers  parties associated with our investment portfolio  and others  would likely be increased  due to the increase in the number of counterparties who become delinquent  file for protection under bankruptcy laws  or default on their obligations to us 
moreover  our markets may experience increased inflationary conditions which could cause loss costs to increase 
deterioration in the investment markets and economic conditions could lead to additional investment losses 
ongoing conditions in the investment markets  the current interest rate environment and general economic conditions have and could continue to adversely affect our net investment income on our fixed income investments and our other invested assets 
for the year ended december   we incurred significant realized and unrealized investment losses  as described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investments 
subsequent to year end  through the date of this report  economic conditions have continued to decline 
in addition to impacting our reported net loss  potential future losses on our investment portfolio  including potential future mark to market results  would adversely impact our equity capital 
net investment income is an important contributor to the company s results of operations  and we currently expect the investment environment to remain challenging for some time 
we expect volatile financial markets and challenging economic conditions to persist for some time and we are unable to predict at what time conditions might improve  or the pace or scale of any such improvement 
depending on market conditions  we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and business 
some of our investments are relatively illiquid and are in asset classes that have been experiencing significant market valuation fluctuations 
although we invest primarily in highly liquid securities in order to ensure our ability to pay valid claims in a prompt manner  we do hold certain investments that may lack liquidity  such as our alternative investments 
if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of our normal cash requirements or are required to post or return collateral in connection with our investment portfolio  we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner  be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize  or both 
at times  the reported value of our liquid and relatively illiquid types of investments and  our high quality  generally liquid asset classes  do not necessarily reflect the lowest current market price for the asset 
if we were forced to sell certain of our assets in the current market  there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell them for the prices at which we have recorded them and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices 
the reduction in market liquidity has also made it difficult to value certain of our securities as trading has become less frequent 
as such  valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may be more susceptible to significant period to period changes which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
the determination of the impairments taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
the determination of the impairments taken on our investments vary by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised 
there can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken in our financial statements 
furthermore  additional impairments may need to be taken in the future  which could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments 

table of contents we are unable to predict the effect that governmental actions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets will have on such markets generally or on the company in particular 
in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions  on october   then president bush signed the eesa into law 
pursuant to the eesa  the us treasury has the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgage backed and other securities from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets 
subsequently  on february   president obama signed into law the american recovery and reinvestment act of the arra  a billion stimulus bill for the purpose of stabilizing the economy by  among other things  creating jobs 
the us federal government and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address the financial crisis 
it is possible that competitors of the company  such as companies that engage in both life and property casualty insurance lines of business  may participate in some or all of the arra programs 
we are unable to predict the effect that any such governmental actions will have on the financial markets generally or on the company s competitive position  business and financial condition in particular  though we are carefully monitoring the situation as it evolves 
a decline in our investment performance could reduce our profitability and hinder our ability to pay claims promptly in accordance with our strategy 
we have historically derived a significant portion of our income from our invested assets  which are comprised of  among other things  fixed maturity securities  such as bonds  asset backed securities  mortgage backed securities and investments in bank loan funds  hedge funds and private equity partnerships 
accordingly  our financial results are subject to a variety of investment risks  including risks relating to general economic conditions  market volatility  interest rate fluctuations  foreign currency risk  liquidity risk and credit and default risk 
additionally  with respect to certain of our investments  we are subject to pre payment or reinvestment risk 
our invested assets have grown over the years and have come to effect a comparably greater contribution to our financial results 
accordingly  a failure to successfully execute our investment strategy could have a material adverse effect on our overall results 
in the event of a significant or total loss in our investment portfolio  the company s ability to pay any claims promptly in accordance with our strategy could be adversely affected 
the market value of our fixed maturity investments is subject to fluctuation depending on changes in various factors  including prevailing interest rates and widening credit spreads 
increases in interest rates could cause the market value of our investment portfolio to decrease  perhaps substantially 
conversely  a decline in interest rates could reduce our investment yield  which would reduce our overall profitability 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
any measures we take that are intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment may not effectively mitigate such interest rate sensitivity 
a portion of our investment portfolio is allocated to other investments which we expect to have different risk characteristics than our investments in traditional fixed maturity securities and short term investments 
these other investments include private equity partnerships  hedge fund investments  senior secured bank loan funds and catastrophe bonds and are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the fair value of certain of these investments is generally established on the basis of the net valuation criteria established by the managers of such investments 
these net valuations are determined based upon the valuation criteria established by the governing documents of the investments 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had ready markets existed for the shares  partnership interests or notes of the investments 
many of the investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales which are determined by the governing documents and limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
these investments expose us to market risks including interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  equity price risk and credit risk 
in addition  we typically do not hold the underlying securities of these investments in our custody accounts  as a result  we generally do not have the ability to quantify the risks associated with these investments in the same manner for which we have for 
table of contents our fixed maturity securities 
the performance of these investments is also dependent on the individual investment managers and the investment strategies 
it is possible that the investment managers will leave and or the investment strategies will become ineffective or that such managers will fail to follow our investment guidelines 
any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse change to our investment performance  and accordingly adversely affect our financial results 
we are exposed to counterparty credit risk  including with respect to reinsurance brokers 
in accordance with industry practice  we pay virtually all amounts owed on claims under our policies to reinsurance brokers  and these brokers  in turn  pay these amounts over to the insurers that have reinsured a portion of their liabilities with us we refer to these insurers as ceding insurers 
likewise  premiums due to us by ceding insurers are virtually all paid to brokers  who then pass such amounts on to us 
in many jurisdictions  if a broker were to fail to make such a payment to a ceding insurer  we would remain liable to the ceding insurer for the deficiency 
conversely  in many jurisdictions  when the ceding insurer pays premiums for these policies to reinsurance brokers for payment over to us  these premiums are considered to have been paid by the cedants and the ceding insurer will no longer be liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premiums 
consequently  in connection with the settlement of reinsurance balances  we assume a substantial degree of credit risk associated with brokers around the world 
we are also exposed to the credit risk of our clients  who  pursuant to their contracts with us  frequently pay us over time 
our premiums receivable at december  totaled million  and these amounts are generally not collateralized 
to the extent such clients become unable to pay future premiums  we would be required to recognize a downward adjustment to our premiums receivable in our financial statements 
as a result of the global economic downturn  our consolidated credit risk  reflecting our counterparty dealings with agents  brokers  customers  retrocessionaires  capital providers  parties associated with our investment portfolio and others has increased  perhaps materially so 
retrocessional reinsurance may become unavailable on acceptable terms 
as part of our risk management  we buy reinsurance for our own account 
this type of insurance when purchased to protect reinsurance companies is known as retrocessional reinsurance 
our primary insurance companies also buy reinsurance from third parties 
from time to time  market conditions including the ongoing financial crisis have limited  and in some cases have prevented  insurers and reinsurers from obtaining reinsurance 
accordingly  we may not be able to obtain our desired amounts of retrocessional reinsurance 
in addition  even if we are able to obtain such retrocessional reinsurance  we may not be able to negotiate terms as favorable to us as in the past 
this could limit the amount of business we are willing to write  or decrease the protection available to us as a result of large loss events 
when we purchase reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance for our own account  the insolvency  inability or reluctance of any of our reinsurers to make timely payments to us under the terms of our reinsurance agreements could have a material adverse effect on us 
generally  we believe that the willingness to pay of some reinsurers and retrocessionaires is declining  and that the overall industry ability to pay has also declined due to the ongoing financial crisis and other factors 
this risk may be more significant to us at present than at most times in the past 
at december   we had recorded million of reinsurance recoverables  net of a valuation allowance of million for uncollectible recoverables 
a large portion of our reinsurance recoverables are concentrated with a relatively small number of reinsurers 
the risk of such concentration of retrocessional coverage may be increased by recent and future consolidation within the industry 
emerging claim and coverage issues  or other litigation  could adversely affect us 
unanticipated developments in the law as well as changes in social and environmental conditions could potentially result in unexpected claims for coverage under our insurance and reinsurance contracts 
these developments and changes may adversely affect us  perhaps materially so 
for example  we could be subject to developments that impose additional coverage obligations on us beyond our underwriting intent  
table of contents or to increases in the number or size of claims to which we are subject 
with respect to our specialty reinsurance and individual risk operations  these legal  social and environmental changes may not become apparent until some point in time after their occurrence 
for example  we could be deemed liable for losses arising out of a matter  such as the potential for industry losses arising out of an avian flu pandemic  that we had not anticipated or had attempted to contractually exclude 
moreover  irrespective of the clarity and inclusiveness of policy language  there can be no assurance that a court or arbitration panel will limit enforceability of policy language or not issue a ruling adverse to us 
our exposure to these uncertainties could be exacerbated by the increased willingness of some market participants to dispute insurance and reinsurance contract and policy wordings 
alternatively  potential efforts by us to exclude such exposures could  if successful  reduce the market s acceptance of our related products 
the full effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict 
as a result  the full extent of our liability under our coverages may not be known for many years after a contract is issued 
our exposure to this uncertainty will grow as our long tail casualty businesses grow  because in these lines claims can typically be made for many years  making them more susceptible to these trends than our traditional catastrophe business  which is typically more short tail 
in addition  we could be adversely affected by the growing trend of plaintiffs targeting participants in the property liability insurance industry in purported class action litigation relating to claim handling and other practices 
although we are seeking to add professional staff and systems to improve our contracts and claims capabilities  we may fail to mitigate our exposure to these growing uncertainties 
the loss of key senior members of management could adversely affect us 
our success has depended  and will continue to depend  in substantial part upon our ability to attract and retain our executive officers 
the loss of services of members of senior management in the future  and the uncertain transition of new members of our senior management team  may strain our ability to execute our growth initiatives 
the loss of one or more of our executive officers could adversely impact our business  by  for example  making it more difficult to retain clients or other business contacts whose relationship depends in part on the service of the departing executives 
in general  the loss of the services of any members of our current senior management team may adversely affect our business  perhaps materially so 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our employees 
in addition  our ability to execute our business strategy is dependent on our ability to attract and retain a staff of qualified underwriters and service personnel 
the location of our global headquarters in bermuda may impede our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees 
under bermuda law  non bermudians other than spouses of bermudians  holders of permanent residents certificates and holders of working residents certificates may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without a valid government work permit 
substantially all of our officers are working in bermuda under work permits that will expire over the next three years 
the bermuda government could refuse to extend these work permits  which would adversely impact us 
in addition  a bermuda government policy limits the duration of work permits to a total of six years  which is subject to certain exemptions only for key employees 
a work permit is issued with an expiry date up to five years and no assurances can be given that any work permit will be issued or  if issued  renewed upon the expiration of the relevant term 
if any of our senior executive officers were not permitted to remain in bermuda  our operations could be disrupted and our financial performance could be adversely affected as a result 
us taxing authorities could contend that one or more of our bermuda subsidiaries are subject to us corporate income tax  as a result of changes in law or regulations  or otherwise 
if the us internal revenue service the irs were to contend successfully that one or more of our bermuda subsidiaries is engaged in a trade or business in the us  such subsidiary would  to the extent not exempted from tax by the us bermuda income tax treaty  be subject to us corporate income tax on that portion of its net income treated as effectively connected with a us trade or business  as well as the us corporate branch profits tax 
although we would vigorously resist such a contention  if we were ultimately held to be subject to taxation  our earnings would correspondingly decline 

table of contents in addition  benefits of the us bermuda income tax treaty which may limit any such tax to income attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by one or more of our bermuda subsidiaries in the us are only available to any of such subsidiaries if more than of its shares are beneficially owned  directly or indirectly  by individuals who are bermuda residents or us citizens or residents 
our bermuda subsidiaries may not be able to continually satisfy such beneficial ownership test or be able to establish it to the satisfaction of the irs 
finally  it is unclear whether the income tax treaty assuming satisfaction of the beneficial ownership test applies to income other than premium income  such as investment income 
congress has recently conducted hearings relating to the tax treatment of offshore insurance and is reported to be considering legislation that would adversely affect reinsurance between affiliates and offshore insurance and reinsurance more generally 
on september   us rep 
richard neal introduced one such proposal  hr  a bill which provides that foreign insurers and reinsurers would be capped in deducting reinsurance premiums ceded from us units to offshore affiliates 
the bill  which has been referred to the house ways and means committee  would limit deductions for related party reinsurance cessions to the average percentage of premium ceded to unrelated reinsurers determined in reference to individual business lines 
other proposals relating to cross border transactions  intangible products  or non us jurisdictions generally have been introduced in a number of congressional committees 
enactment of such legislation  depending on the specific details  could adversely affect our financial results 
regulatory challenges in the us or elsewhere to our bermuda operations claims of exemption from insurance regulation could restrict our ability to operate  increase our costs  or otherwise adversely impact us 
renaissance reinsurance  davinci and top layer re are not licensed or admitted in any jurisdiction except bermuda 
renaissance reinsurance  glencoe  davinci and top layer re each conduct business only from their principal offices in bermuda and do not maintain an office in the us the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework continues to be subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including the us and various states within the us if our bermuda insurance or reinsurance operations become subject to the insurance laws of any state in the us  we could face inquiries or challenges to the future operations of these companies 
moreover  we could be put at a competitive disadvantage in the future with respect to competitors that are licensed and admitted in us jurisdictions 
among other things  jurisdictions in the us do not permit insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non admitted insurers on their statutory financial statements unless security is posted 
our contracts generally require us to post a letter of credit or provide other security after a reinsured reports a claim 
in order to post these letters of credit  issuing banks generally require collateral 
it is possible that the european union or other countries might adopt a similar regime in the future  or that us rules could be altered in a way that treats bermuda based companies disproportionately 
any such development  or if we are unable to post security in the form of letters of credit or trust funds when required  could significantly and negatively affect our operations 
glencoe and lantana are currently eligible  non admitted excess and surplus lines insurers in  respectively  and states and territories of the us and are each subject to certain regulatory and reporting requirements of these states 
however  neither glencoe nor lantana is admitted or licensed in any us jurisdiction  moreover  glencoe only conducts business from bermuda 
accordingly  the scope of glencoe s and lantana s activities in the us is limited  which could adversely affect their ability to compete 
although surplus lines business is generally less regulated than the admitted market  the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future 
federal and or state measures may be introduced and promulgated that could result in increased oversight and regulation of surplus lines insurance 
additionally  some recent and pending cases in florida and california courts have raised potentially significant questions regarding surplus lines insurance in those states such as whether surplus lines insurers will be subject to policy form content  filing and approval requirements or additional taxes 
these cases also could foreshadow more extensive oversight of surplus lines insurance by other jurisdictions 
stonington  which writes insurance in all states and the district of columbia on an admitted basis  is subject to extensive regulation under state statutes which confer regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers on state insurance commissioners 
such regulation generally is designed to protect policyholders rather than investors or shareholders of the insurer 

table of contents our current or future business strategy could cause one or more of our currently unregulated non insurance subsidiaries to become subject to some form of regulation 
any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on our ability to do business  and could also result in fines and other sanctions  any or all of which could adversely affect our financial results and operations 
we could be required to allocate considerable time and resources to comply with any new or additional regulatory requirements  and any such requirements may impact the operations of our insurance non insurance subsidiaries and ultimately could impact our financial condition as well 
in addition  we could be adversely affected if a regulatory authority believed we had failed to comply with applicable law or regulation 
operational risks  including systems or human failures  are inherent in business  including ours 
we are subject to operational risks including fraud  employee errors  failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization  failure to comply with regulatory requirements or obligations under our agreements  information technology failures  or external events 
losses from these risks may occur from time to time and may be significant 
as our business and operations grow more complex we are exposed to more risk in these areas 
our modeling  underwriting and information technology and application systems are critical to our success 
moreover  our proprietary technology and application systems have been an important part of our underwriting strategy and our ability to compete successfully 
we have also licensed certain systems and data from third parties 
we cannot be certain that we will have access to these  or comparable  service providers  or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended 
while we have implemented disaster recovery and other business contingency plans  a defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology and application systems could result in reduced or delayed revenue growth  higher than expected losses  management distraction  or harm to our reputation 
we believe appropriate controls and mitigation procedures are in place to prevent significant risk of defect in our internal controls  information technology and application systems  but internal controls provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance as to the absence of errors or irregularities and any ineffectiveness of such controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
our functional currency is the us dollar  however  as we expand geographically  an increasing portion of our premium is  and likely will be  written in currencies other than the us dollar and a portion of our claims and claim expense reserves is also in non dollar currencies 
moreover  we maintain a portion of our cash and investments in currencies other than the us dollar 
although we generally seek to hedge significant non us dollar positions  we may  from time to time  experience losses resulting solely from fluctuations in the values of these foreign currencies  which could cause our consolidated earnings to decrease 
in addition  failure to manage our foreign currency exposures could cause our results of operations to be more volatile 
we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or only available on unfavorable terms 
we monitor our capital adequacy on a regular basis 
the capital requirements of our business depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
our ability to sell our reinsurance and insurance products is largely dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies 
to the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to support our future operating requirements  we may need to raise additional funds through financings or limit our growth 
any further equity or debt financing  or capacity needed for letters of credit  if available at all  may be on terms that are unfavorable to us  particularly in light of the recent disruptions  uncertainty and volatility in the capital and credit markets 
our ability to raise such capital successfully would depend upon the facts and circumstances at the time  including our financial position and operating results  market conditions  and 
table of contents applicable legal issues 
access to capital on attractive terms has been challenging for many companies during the ongoing global credit crisis 
if we are unable to obtain adequate capital if and when needed  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
in august the term of our million committed revolving credit facility will expire 
we may not succeed in renewing this facility on terms attractive to us or at all 
our ability to renew or replace this credit facility is subject to many factors beyond our control  such as more stringent credit criteria and or conditions emanating from or as a result of the currently difficult conditions in the global capital and credit markets  the effect of which may be to make a renewal or replacement so onerous as to make us consider alternate sources of such liquidity or limit our ability to write business for our clients 
the covenants in our debt agreements limit our financial and operational flexibility  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
we have incurred indebtedness  and may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
at december   we had an aggregate of million of indebtedness outstanding 
our indebtedness primarily consists of publicly traded notes and letter of credit and revolving credit facilities 
for more details on our indebtedness  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources 
the agreements covering our indebtedness  particularly our bank loans  contain covenants that limit our ability  among other things  to borrow money  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  sell assets  merge or consolidate 
these agreements also require us to maintain specific financial ratios 
if we fail to comply with these covenants or meet these financial ratios  the lenders under our credit facilities could declare a default and demand immediate repayment of all amounts owed to them  cancel their commitments to lend or issue letters of credit  or both  and require us to pledge additional or a different type of collateral 
because we are a holding company  we are dependent on dividends and payments from our subsidiaries 
as a holding company with no direct operations  we rely on investment income  cash dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to make principal and interest payments on our debt and to pay dividends to our shareholders 
the holding company does not have any operations and from time to time may not have significant liquid assets 
bermuda law and various us insurance regulations may limit the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends 
if our subsidiaries are restricted from paying dividends to us  we may be unable to pay dividends or to repay our indebtedness 
for example  since our us insurance subsidiaries may only pay dividends out of earned surplus  and as these subsidiaries earned surplus is negative  they cannot currently pay dividends without the applicable state insurance department approval 
for a more detailed discussion of these regulations  see item business regulation 
acquisitions or strategic investments that we made or may make could turn out to be unsuccessful 
as part of our strategy  we frequently monitor and analyze opportunities to acquire or make a strategic investment in new or other businesses that will not detract from our core reinsurance and individual risk operations 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions or strategic investments as well as the integration of an acquired business or new personnel could result in a substantial diversion of management resources 
acquisitions could involve numerous additional risks such as potential losses from unanticipated litigation or levels of claims and inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs 
any failure by us to effectively limit such risks or implement our acquisitions or strategic investment strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
results in certain of our newer or potentially expanding business lines could cause significant volatility in our consolidated financial statements 
as we continue to grow and diversify our operations  certain of our new or potentially expanding business lines could have a significant negative impact on our financial results or cause significant volatility in our results for any fiscal quarter or year 
for example  we may experience losses or experience significant volatility in our financial results with respect to our multi peril crop business as a result of volatility in 
table of contents commodity prices and weather events  such as flooding  drought  hail  windstorms and other natural phenomena  all of which impacts the profitability of this line of business 
in addition  our weather and energy products and trading business is accounted for at fair value and the value of our positions can change significantly which could have a significant negative impact on our financial results  or cause significant volatility in our result for any fiscal quarter or year 
we could be adversely impacted by a failure to comply with the terms of the company s settlement agreement with the sec 
on march   the united states district court for the southern district of new york signed the final judgment approving our settlement with the sec arising from the restatement of our financial statements for the fiscal years ended december   and in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement  we previously retained an independent consultant to review certain of our internal controls  policies and procedures as well as the design and implementation of the review conducted by independent counsel reporting to the non executive members of our board of directors and certain additional procedures performed by our auditors in connection with their audit of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  while we will strive to fully comply with the settlement agreement with the sec  it is possible that the enforcement staff of the sec and or the independent consultant may take issue with our cooperation despite our efforts 
any such failure to comply with the settlement agreement or any such perception that we have failed to comply  could adversely affect us  perhaps materially so 
some aspects of our corporate structure may discourage third party takeovers and other transactions or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management 
some provisions of our amended and restated bye laws have the effect of making more difficult or discouraging unsolicited takeover bids from third parties or preventing the removal of our current board of directors and management 
in particular  our bye laws prohibit transfers of our capital shares if the transfer would result in a person owning or controlling shares that constitute or more of any class or series of our shares 
in addition  our byelaws reduce the total voting power of any shareholder owning  directly or indirectly  beneficially or otherwise  as described in our bye laws  more than of our common shares to not more than of the total voting power of our capital stock unless otherwise waived at the discretion of the board 
the primary purpose of these provisions is to reduce the likelihood that we will be deemed a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of the internal revenue code for us federal tax purposes 
however  these provisions may also have the effect of deterring purchases of large blocks of common shares or proposals to acquire us  even if some or a majority of our shareholders might deem these purchases or acquisition proposals to be in their best interests 
in addition  our bye laws provide for  among other things a classified board  whose size is fixed and whose members may be removed by the shareholders only for cause upon a vote  restrictions on the ability of shareholders to nominate persons to serve as directors  submit resolutions to a shareholder vote and requisition special general meetings  a large number of authorized but unissued shares which may be issued by the board without further shareholder action  and a shareholder vote to amend  repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with several provisions of the bye laws 
these bye law provisions make it more difficult to acquire control of us by means of a tender offer  open market purchase  proxy contest or otherwise 
these provisions are designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our directors  which we believe would generally best serve the interests of our shareholders 
however  these provisions could have the effect of discouraging a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 
in addition  these bye law provisions could prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management 
to the extent these provisions discourage takeover attempts  they could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or could depress the market price of the shares 

table of contents we indirectly own certain us based insurance subsidiaries 
our ownership of a us insurance company can  under applicable state insurance company laws and regulations  delay or impede a change of control of renaissancere 
it is possible that we will form  acquire or invest in other us domestic insurance companies in the future  which could make this risk more severe 
under applicable state insurance regulations  any proposed purchase of or more of our voting securities would require the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulatory authorities 
investors may have difficulties in serving process or enforcing judgments against us in the us we are a bermuda company 
in addition  certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the us all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the us investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the us on our directors and officers who reside outside the us or recovering against us or these directors and officers on judgments of us courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the us federal securities laws whether or not we appoint an agent in the us to receive service of process 
risks related to our industry the reinsurance business is historically cyclical and the pricing and terms for our products may decline  which could affect our profitability 
the reinsurance and insurance industries have historically been cyclical  characterized by periods of decreasing prices followed by periods of increasing prices 
reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in their results of operations due to numerous factors  including the frequency and severity of catastrophic events  perceptions of risk  levels of capacity  general economic conditions and underwriting results of other insurers and reinsurers 
all of these factors fluctuate and may contribute to price declines generally in the reinsurance and insurance industries 
for example  an increase in capital in our industry after the catastrophe events  and the florida legislation  described below  helped create a softening market where pricing decreased in certain lines and became less attractive in the past few years 
the catastrophe exposed lines in which we are a market leader are affected significantly by volatile and unpredictable developments  including natural and man made disasters 
the occurrence  or nonoccurrence  of catastrophic events  the frequency and severity of which are inherently unpredictable  affects both industry results and consequently prevailing market prices of our products 
we expect premium rates and other terms and conditions of trade to vary in the future 
if demand for our products falls or the supply of competing capacity rises  our growth and our profitability could  due in part to our disciplined approach to underwriting  be adversely affected 
in particular  we might lose existing customers or decline business  which we might not regain when industry conditions improve 
in recent years  hedge funds and investment banks have been increasingly active in the reinsurance market and markets for related risks 
while this trend has slowed during the current financial dislocation  we generally expect increased competition from a wider range of entrants over time 
it is possible that such new or alternative capital could cause reductions in prices of our products 
to the extent that industry pricing of our products does not meet our hurdle rate  we would generally expect to reduce our future underwriting activities thus resulting in reduced premiums and a reduction in expected earnings 
recent or future legislation may decrease the demand for our property catastrophe reinsurance products and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in january  the state of florida enacted legislation known as bill no 
cs hb a the bill  which increased the access of primary florida insurers to the fhcf 
through the fhcf  the state of florida currently provides below market rate reinsurance of up to billion per season  an increase from the previous cap of billion  with the state able to further increase the limits up to an additional billion per season 
in addition  the legislation allows florida insurers to choose a lower retention level for fhcf reinsurance coverage  at specified rates for specified layers of coverage 
further  the legislation expanded the ability of citizens  a state sponsored entity  to compete with private insurance and reinsurance companies  such as ours  by  for example  authorizing citizens to write multi peril policies in 
table of contents high risk account coverage areas 
moreover  the legislation mandated the reduction of citizens in force rates by an average of  repealed a rate increase that was to be effective march   and froze any additional rate increases for the remainder of also  citizens premium rates are no longer required to be non competitive with the voluntary  private market and are no longer required to be based on the highest rate offered by the top insurers in a given area 
in sum  the legislation reduced the role of the private markets in providing support for florida based risks  a market in which we have established substantial market share 
efforts in to reduce the scale of the state involvement in the private markets were not successful 
while we have sought and intend to continue to seek to utilize our strong relationships  record of superior service and financial strength to mitigate the impact of the legislation  we believe the bill caused a substantial decline in the private reinsurance and insurance markets in and relating to florida  and contributed to the decline in our property catastrophe gross premiums written in and as compared to because of our position as one of the largest providers of catastrophe exposed coverage  both on a global basis and in respect of the florida market  the bill may have had a disproportionate adverse impact on us compared to other market participants 
proposals to reduce the expansion of the fhcf introduced in never materialized and there can be no assurance that additional legislation reducing the size of the private markets relating to florida will not be enacted 
it is also possible that other states  particularly those with atlantic or gulf coast exposures  may enact new or expanded legislation based on the florida precedent  or may otherwise enact legislation  which would further diminish aggregate private market demand for our products 
alternatively  legislation adversely impacting the private markets could be enacted on a regional or at the federal level 
moreover  we believe that numerous modeled potential catastrophes could exceed the actual or politically acceptable bonded capacity of the fhcf  which could lead either to a severe dislocation or the necessity of federal intervention in the florida market  either of which would adversely impact the private insurance and reinsurance industry 
other political  regulatory and industry initiatives could adversely affect our business 
the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework is subject to heavy scrutiny by the us and individual state governments as well as an increasing number of international authorities 
government regulators are generally concerned with the protection of policyholders to the exclusion of other constituencies  including shareholders 
governmental authorities in both the us and worldwide seem increasingly interested in the potential risks posed by the reinsurance industry as a whole  and to commercial and financial systems in general 
while we do not believe these inquiries have identified meaningful new risks posed by the reinsurance industry  and we cannot predict the exact nature  timing or scope of possible governmental initiatives  we believe it is likely there will be increased regulatory intervention in our industry in the future 
for example  the us federal government has increased its scrutiny of the insurance regulatory framework in recent years  and some state legislators have considered or enacted laws that will alter and likely increase state regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies and holding companies 
moreover  the naic  which is an association of the insurance commissioners of all states and the district of columbia and state insurance regulators  regularly reexamine existing laws and regulations 
for example  we could be adversely affected by proposals to provide insurance and reinsurance capacity in markets and to consumers that we target  such as the legislation enacted in florida in early described above  require our participation in industry pools and guaranty associations  expand the scope of coverage under existing policies for matters such as hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  and the new orleans flood  or such as a pandemic flu outbreak  increasingly mandate the terms of insurance and reinsurance policies  establish a new federal insurance regulator or financial industry systemic risk regulator  revise laws or regulations under which we operate  such as the farm bill  or disproportionately benefit the companies of one country over those of another 

table of contents the growth of our primary insurance business  which is regulated more comprehensively than reinsurance  increases our exposure to adverse political  judicial and legal developments 
we are incorporated in bermuda and are therefore subject to changes in bermuda law and regulation that may have an adverse impact on our operations  including imposition of tax liability or increased regulatory supervision or change in regulation 
in addition  we are subject to changes in the political environment in bermuda  which could make it difficult to operate in  or attract talent to  bermuda 
the bermuda insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework recently has become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including in the united states and in various states within the united states 
we are unable to predict the future impact on our operations of changes in the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject 
moreover  our exposure to potential regulatory initiatives could be heightened by the fact that our principal operating companies are domiciled in  and operate exclusively from  bermuda 
for example  bermuda  a small jurisdiction  may be disadvantaged in participating in global or cross border regulatory matters as compared with larger jurisdictions such as the us or the leading european union countries 
in addition  bermuda  which is currently an overseas territory of the united kingdom  may consider changes to its relationship with the united kingdom in the future 
these changes could adversely affect bermuda s position in respect of its regulatory initiatives  which could adversely impact us commercially 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
the reinsurance industry is highly competitive 
we compete  and will continue to compete  with major us and us insurers and property catastrophe reinsurers  including other bermuda based reinsurers 
many of our competitors have greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
historically  periods of increased capacity levels in our industry generally have led to increased competition  and decreased prices for our products 
we believe that our principal competitors in the property catastrophe reinsurance market include other companies active in the bermuda market  including ace  allied world  arch  axis  endurance  everest re  ipc  montpelier re  partner re  platinum  transatlantic  validus  white mountains and xl 
we also compete with certain lloyd s syndicates active in the london market  as well as with a number of other industry participants  such as aig  berkshire  hannover re  munich re group and swiss re 
as our business evolves over time  we expect our competitors to change as well 
for example  following hurricane katrina in august  a significant number of new reinsurance companies were formed in bermuda which have resulted in new competition  which may well continue in subsequent periods 
also  hedge funds and investment banks have shown an interest in entering the reinsurance market  either through the formation of reinsurance companies  or through the use of other financial products  such as catastrophe bonds and other cat linked securities 
in addition  we may not be aware of other companies that may be planning to enter the reinsurance market or of existing companies that may be planning to raise additional capital 
we cannot predict what effect any of these developments may have on our businesses 
the markets in which our individual risk unit operates are also highly competitive 
primary insurers compete on the basis of factors including distribution channels  product  price  service and financial strength 
many of our primary insurance competitors  especially in jurisdictions in which we have recently expanded  or may expand in the future  are larger and more established than we are and have greater financial resources and consumer recognition 
we seek primary insurance pricing that will result in adequate returns on the capital allocated to our primary insurance business 
we may lose primary insurance business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices or on more advantageous terms 
consolidation in the re insurance industry could adversely impact us 
we believe that several re insurance industry participants are seeking to consolidate 
these consolidated entities may try to use their enhanced market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services 
if competitive pressures reduce our prices  we would expect to write less business 
as the insurance industry consolidates  competition for customers will become more intense and the importance of acquiring and properly servicing each customer will become greater 
we could incur greater expenses relating to customer acquisition and retention  further reducing our operating margins 
in addition  insurance companies that merge may be able to spread their risks across a consolidated  larger capital 
table of contents base so that they require less reinsurance 
the number of companies offering retrocessional reinsurance may decline 
reinsurance intermediaries could also consolidate  potentially adversely impacting our ability to access business and distribute our products 
we could also experience more robust competition from larger  better capitalized competitors 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business or our results of operation 
the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and the european union are considering measures that might increase our taxes and reduce our net income 
the oecd has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition 
these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world 
in the oecd s report dated april  and updated as of june and november via a global forum  bermuda was not listed as an uncooperative tax haven jurisdiction because it had previously committed to eliminate harmful tax practices and to embrace international tax standards for transparency  exchange of information and the elimination of any aspects of the regimes for financial and other services that attract business with no substantial domestic activity 
we are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes 
regulatory regimes and changes to accounting rules may adversely impact financial results irrespective of business operations 
accounting standards and regulatory changes may require modifications to our accounting principles  both prospectively and for prior periods and such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
in particular  the sec has formally proposed a plan to first allow and then require companies to file financial statements in accordance with ifrs rather than gaap 
such changes could have a significant impact on our financial reporting  impacting key matters such as our loss reserving policies and premium and expense recognition 
for example  the international accounting standards board is considering adopting an accounting standard that would require all reinsurance and insurance contracts to be accounted for under a new measurement basis  current exit value  which is considered to be closely related to fair value 
we are currently evaluating how the sec s initiatives will impact us  including as respects to our loss reserving policy or the effect it might have on recognizing premium revenue and policy acquisition costs 
required modification of our existing principles  either with respect to these issues or other issues in the future  could have an impact on our results of operations  including changing the timing of the recognition of underwriting income  increasing the volatility of our reported earnings and changing our overall financial statement presentation 
heightened scrutiny of issues and practices in the insurance industry may adversely affect our business 
we believe that certain government authorities  including state officials in florida  are continuing to scrutinize and investigate a number of issues and practices within the insurance industry 
while we have not been named in any actions or proceedings  it is possible such scrutiny could expand to include us in the future  and it is also possible that these investigations or related regulatory developments will mandate or otherwise give rise to changes in industry practices in a fashion that increases our costs or requires us to alter how we conduct our business 
we cannot predict the ultimate effect that these investigations  and any changes in industry practice  including future legislation or regulations that may become applicable to us  will have on the insurance industry  the regulatory framework  or our business 
as noted above  because we frequently assume the credit risk of the counterparties with whom we do business throughout our insurance and reinsurance operations  our results of operations could be adversely affected if the credit quality of these counterparties is severely impacted by the current investigations in the insurance industry or by changes to industry practices

our operating subsidiaries are subject to claims litigation involving disputed interpretations of policy coverages 
generally  our primary insurance operations are subject to greater frequency and diversity of claims and claims related litigation and  in some jurisdictions  may be subject to direct actions by allegedly injured persons or entities seeking damages from policyholders 
these lawsuits  involving claims on policies issued by our subsidiaries which are typical to the insurance industry in general and in the normal course of business  are considered in our loss and loss expense reserves which are discussed in its loss reserves discussion 
in addition to claims litigation  we and our subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits and regulatory actions in the normal course of business that do not arise from or directly relate to claims on insurance policies 
this category of business litigation may involve allegations of underwriting or claims handling errors or misconduct  employment claims  regulatory activity or disputes arising from our business ventures

overview renaissancere  established in bermuda in to write principally property catastrophe reinsurance  is today a leading global provider of reinsurance and insurance coverages and related services 
through our operating subsidiaries  we seek to obtain a portfolio of reinsurance  insurance and financial risks in each of our businesses that are significantly better than the market average and produce an attractive return on equity 
we accomplish this by leveraging our core capabilities of risk assessment and information management  and by investing in our capabilities to serve our customers across the cycles that have historically characterized our markets 
overall  our strategy focuses on superior risk selection  marketing  capital management and joint ventures 
we provide value to our clients and joint venture partners in the form of financial security  innovative products  and responsive service 
we are known as a leader in paying valid reinsurance claims promptly 
we principally measure our financial success through long term growth in tangible book value per common share plus accumulated dividends  which we believe is the most appropriate measure of our company s performance  and believe we have delivered superior performance in respect of this measure over time 
since a substantial portion of the reinsurance and insurance we write provides protection from damages relating to natural and man made catastrophes  our results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of such catastrophic events  and the coverages we offer to clients affected by these events 
we are exposed to significant losses from these catastrophic events and other exposures that we cover 
accordingly  we expect a significant degree of volatility in our financial results and our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year  based on the level of insured catastrophic losses occurring around the world 
our revenues are principally derived from three sources net premiums earned from the reinsurance and insurance policies we sell  net investment income and realized gains from the investment of our capital funds and the investment of the cash we receive on the policies which we sell  and other income received from our joint ventures  advisory services  weather trading activities and various other items 
our expenses primarily consist of net claims and claim expenses incurred on the policies of reinsurance and insurance we sell  acquisition costs which typically represent a percentage of the premiums we write  operating expenses which primarily consist of personnel expenses  rent and other operating expenses  corporate expenses which include certain executive  legal and consulting expenses  costs for research and development  and other miscellaneous costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company  minority interest  which represents the interest of third parties with respect to the net income of davincire  and interest and dividend costs related to our debt  preference shares and subordinated obligation to our capital trust 
we are also subject to taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate  however  since the majority of our income is currently earned in bermuda  a non taxable jurisdiction  the tax impact to our operations has historically been minimal 
we currently expect our growth outside of bermuda to result in a higher effective tax rate in future periods 
the operating results  also known as the underwriting results  of an insurance or reinsurance company are discussed frequently by reference to its net claims and claim expense ratio  underwriting expense ratio  and combined ratio 
the net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by dividing net claims and claim expenses incurred by net premiums earned 
the underwriting expense ratio is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses acquisition expenses and operational expenses by net premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the net claims and claim expense ratio and the underwriting expense ratio 
a 
table of contents combined ratio below generally indicates profitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income 
a combined ratio over generally indicates unprofitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income 
we also discuss our net claims and claim expense ratio on an accident year basis 
this ratio is calculated by taking net claims and claim expenses  excluding development on net claims and claim expenses from events that took place in prior fiscal years  divided by net premiums earned 
we conduct our business through two reportable segments  reinsurance and individual risk 
those segments are more fully described as follows reinsurance our reinsurance segment has three main units property catastrophe reinsurance  written for our own account and for davinci  is our traditional core business 
we believe we are one of the world s leading providers of this coverage  based on catastrophe gross premiums written 
this coverage protects against large natural catastrophes  such as earthquakes  hurricanes and tsunamis  as well as claims arising from other natural and man made catastrophes such as winter storms  freezes  floods  fires  wind storms  tornadoes  explosions and acts of terrorism 
we offer this coverage to insurance companies and other reinsurers primarily on an excess of loss basis 
this means that we begin paying when our customers claims from a catastrophe exceed a certain retained amount 
specialty reinsurance  written for our own account and for davinci  covering certain targeted classes of business where we believe we have a sound basis for underwriting and pricing the risk that we assume 
our portfolio includes various classes of business  such as catastrophe exposed workers compensation  surety  terrorism  medical malpractice  catastrophe exposed personal lines property  casualty clash  catastrophe exposed personal lines property  certain other casualty lines and other specialty lines of reinsurance that we collectively refer to as specialty reinsurance 
we believe that we are seen as a market leader in certain of these classes of business  such as casualty clash  surety  catastrophe exposed workers compensation and terrorism 
through our ventures unit  we pursue joint ventures and other strategic relationships 
our four principal business activities in this area are property catastrophe joint ventures which we manage  such as top layer re and davinci  strategic investments in other market participants  such as our investments in channelre  platinum and the tower hill companies  where  rather than assuming exclusive management responsibilities ourselves  we partner with other market participants  weather and energy products and trading activities  and fee based consulting services  research and development and loss and mitigation activities 
only business activities that appear in our consolidated underwriting results  such as davinci and certain reinsurance transactions  are included in our reinsurance segment results  our share of the results of our investments in other ventures  accounted for under the equity method and our weather related activities are included in the other category of our segment results 
individual risk we define our individual risk segment to include underwriting that involves understanding the characteristics of the original underlying insurance policy 
our principal contracts include insurance policies and quota share reinsurance with respect to risks including multi peril crop  which includes multi peril crop insurance  crop hail and other named peril agriculture risk management products  commercial property  which principally includes catastrophe exposed commercial property products  commercial multi line  which includes commercial property and liability coverage  such as general liability  automobile liability and physical damage  building and contents  professional liability and various specialty products  and personal lines property  which principally includes homeowners personal lines property coverage and catastrophe exposed personal lines property coverage 
our individual risk business is primarily produced through four distribution channels a wholly owned program manager where we write primary insurance through our own subsidiary  third party program managers where we write primary insurance through third party program managers  who produce 
table of contents business pursuant to agreed upon underwriting guidelines and provide related back office functions  quota share reinsurance where we write quota share reinsurance with primary insurers who  similar to our third party program managers  provide most of the back office and support functions  and brokers and agents where we write primary insurance produced through licensed intermediaries on a risk by risk basis 
our individual risk business is written by the glencoe group through its principal operating subsidiaries glencoe and lantana  which write on an excess and surplus lines basis  and through stonington and stonington lloyds  which write on an admitted basis 
since the inception of our individual risk business  we have substantially relied on third parties for services including the generation of premium  the issuance of policies and the processing of claims 
we actively oversee our third party partners through an operations review team at glencoe specialty services  which conducts initial due diligence as well as ongoing monitoring 
we have been investing in initiatives to strengthen our operating platform  enhance our internal capabilities  and expand the resources we commit to our individual risk operations 
in furtherance of these initiatives  we completed the acquisition of substantially all the net assets of agro national  llc and cms in  as further described below 
acquisitions on june   the company acquired substantially all the assets and assumed certain liabilities of agro national  llc 
agro national is based in council bluffs  iowa and is a managing general underwriter of multi peril crop insurance 
agro national offers high quality risk protection products and services to the agricultural community throughout the us agro national participates in the us federal government s multi peril crop insurance program and has been writing business on behalf of stonington  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  since the base purchase price paid by the company was million  plus additional amounts as determined in accordance with the terms of the asset purchase agreement 
in connection with the purchase  the company recorded million of intangible assets and million of goodwill 
the acquisition was undertaken to purchase the distribution channel for the company s multi peril crop insurance business which was previously conducted through a managing general agency contractual relationship with agro national  llc 
other factors that added to the value of agro national  llc included its agent relationships  systems and technology  brand name and workforce 
these factors resulted in a purchase price greater than the fair value of the net assets acquired and the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets 
the acquisition of the net assets was accounted for using the purchase method in accordance with fasb statement no 
 business combinations fas 
effective april   the company purchased substantially all the assets of cms 
cms was subsequently renamed glencoe claims 
glencoe claims is based in roswell  georgia and is a privately held company specializing in claims administration  adjusting and consulting services for insurance companies  managing general agents  self insured clients  fronted programs and clients with substantial retentions or deductibles 
glencoe claims has a proprietary network of licensed adjusters and offers services on a national basis 
the company uses glencoe claims for claims services solely for its own business and glencoe claims is not currently providing claims services to third parties 
the base purchase price paid by the company was million  plus additional amounts as determined in accordance with the terms of the asset purchase agreement 
in connection with the purchase  the company acquired net assets with a fair value of million and recorded million of goodwill 
goodwill is estimated to have an indefinite life and is recorded entirely in the company s individual risk segment 
in addition to the company s million investment in tower hill during  the company invested million on july   representing a equity interest  in the tower hill companies 
the tower hill companies operate primarily in the state of florida 
thig is a managing general agency specializing in insurance coverage for site built and manufactured homes 
thcs and thcm provide claim adjustment services through exclusive agreements with thig 
the investment in the tower hill companies was undertaken to expand the company s core platforms by obtaining ownership in an additional distribution channel for the florida homeowners market and to enhance relationships with other stakeholders 
other factors that added to the value of the tower hill companies included its reputation  agent relationships  systems and technology 
these factors resulted in an investment greater than the fair 
table of contents value of the net assets acquired and the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets 
in connection with the investment  the company recorded million of intangible assets and million of goodwill on the july  effective date 
the investment in the tower hill companies was accounted for using the equity method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock apb and as such  the goodwill and intangible assets are recorded under investments in other ventures  under equity method in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  new business in addition to the potential growth of our existing reinsurance and insurance businesses  from time to time we consider diversification into new ventures  either through organic growth  the formation of new joint ventures  or the acquisition of or the investment in other companies or books of business of other companies 
this potential diversification includes opportunities to write targeted  additional classes of risk exposed business  both directly for our own account and through possible new joint venture opportunities 
we also regularly evaluate opportunities to grow our business by utilizing our skills  capabilities  proprietary technology and relationships to expand into further risk related coverages  services and products 
generally  we focus on underwriting or trading risks where reasonably sufficient data may be available  and where our analytical abilities may provide us a competitive advantage  in order for us to seek to model estimated probabilities of losses and returns in accordance with our approach in respect of our current portfolio of risks 
we also regularly review potential new investments  in both operating entities and financial instruments 
we believe the current period of market dislocation may have increased the prospects that we can deploy capital in such initiatives at attractive expected rates of return 
in evaluating potential new ventures or investments  we generally seek an attractive return on equity  the ability to develop or capitalize on a competitive advantage  and opportunities which we believe will not detract from our core reinsurance and individual risk operations 
accordingly  we regularly review strategic opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible transactions  although there can be no assurance that we will complete any such transactions or that any such transaction would be successful or contribute materially to our results of operations or financial condition 
we believe that our ability to potentially attract investment and operational opportunities is supported by our strong reputation and financial resources  and by the capabilities and track record of our ventures unit 
summary of critical accounting estimates claims and claim expense reserves general description we believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves 
claims and claim expense reserves represent estimates  including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell 
we establish our claims and claim expense reserves by taking claims reported to us by insureds and ceding companies  but which have not yet been paid case reserves  adding the costs for additional case reserves additional case reserves which represent our estimates for claims previously reported to us which we believe may not be adequately reserved as of that date  and adding estimates for the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr 

table of contents the following table summarizes our claims and claim expense reserves by line of business and split between case reserves  additional case reserves and ibnr at december  and at december  case reserves additional case reserves ibnr total in thousands property catastrophe reinsurance specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total at december  in thousands property catastrophe reinsurance specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves are not precise in that  among other matters  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends and other variable factors 
some  but not all  of our reserves are further subject to the uncertainty inherent in actuarial methodologies and estimates 
because a reserve estimate is simply an insurer s estimate at a point in time of its ultimate liability  and because there are numerous factors which affect reserves and claims payments but cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our estimates of reserves 
if we determine in a subsequent period that adjustments to our previously established reserves are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the twelve months ended december   and  changes to prior year estimated claims reserves increased our net income by million  million and million  respectively  excluding the consideration of changes in reinstatement premium  profit commissions  davincire minority interest and income tax expense 
our reserving methodology for each line of business uses a loss reserving process that calculates a point estimate for the company s ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims and claim expenses 
we do not calculate a range of estimates 
we use this point estimate  along with paid claims and case reserves  to record our best estimate of additional case reserves and ibnr in our financial statements 
under gaap  we are not permitted to establish estimates for catastrophe claims and claim expense reserves until an event occurs that gives rise to a loss 
reserving for our reinsurance claims involves other uncertainties  such as the dependence on information from ceding companies  which among other matters  includes the time lag inherent in reporting information from the primary insurer to us or to our ceding companies and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
the information received from ceding companies is typically in the form of bordereaux  broker notifications of loss and or discussions with ceding companies or their brokers 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of paid claims and case reserves 
we sometimes also receive an estimate or provision for ibnr 
this information is often updated and adjusted from time to time during the loss settlement period as new data or facts in respect of initial claims  client accounts  industry or event trends may be reported or emerge in addition to changes in applicable statutory and case laws 
included in our results for are million of net claims and claim expenses incurred as a result of losses arising from hurricanes gustav and ike which struck the united states in the third quarter of our estimates of losses from hurricanes gustav and ike are based on factors including currently available information derived from the company s preliminary claims information from certain clients and brokers  
table of contents industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models  and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
given the magnitude and recent occurrence of these events  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  several of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates 
in addition  actual losses from these events may increase if our reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations 
our actual losses from these events will likely vary  perhaps materially  from these current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  including the preliminary nature of the available information  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  the effects of any demand surge on claims activity and complex coverage and other legal issues 
included in our results for are million of net claims and claim expenses from kyrill and the uk flood losses which occurred in  as well as million in estimated losses associated with exposure to sub prime related casualty losses 
estimates of these losses are based on a review of potentially exposed contracts  information reported by and discussions with counterparties  and the company s estimate of losses related to those contracts and are subject to change as more information is reported and becomes available 
such information is frequently reported more slowly  and with less initial accuracy  with respect to non us events such as kyrill and the non us floods than with large us catastrophe losses 
in addition  the sub prime related casualty net claims and claim expenses are based on underlying liability contracts which are considered long tail business  and will therefore take many years before the actual losses are known and reported  which increases the uncertainty with respect to the estimate for ultimate losses for this event 
the net claims and claim expenses from kyrill  the uk floods and sub prime related casualty losses are all attributable to the company s reinsurance segment 
during  we incurred significant losses from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
our estimates of these losses are based on factors including currently available information derived from claims information from our clients and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
in particular  due to the size and unusual complexity of certain legal and claims issues  particularly but not exclusively relating to hurricane katrina  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  our loss estimates 
our actual losses from these events will likely vary  perhaps materially  from our current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  and complex coverage and other legal issues 
because of the inherent uncertainties discussed above  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates  and we have generally experienced favorable development on prior year reserves in the last several years 
however  there is no assurance that this will occur in future periods 
our reserving techniques  assumptions and processes differ between our reinsurance and individual risk segments  as well as between our property catastrophe reinsurance and specialty reinsurance businesses within our reinsurance segment 
following is a discussion of the risks we insure and reinsure  the reserving techniques  assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves  and our current estimates versus our initial estimates of our claims reserves  for each of these units 
reinsurance segment property catastrophe reinsurance within our property catastrophe reinsurance unit  we principally write property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance contracts to insure insurance and reinsurance companies against natural and man made catastrophes 
under these contracts  we indemnify an insurer or reinsurer when its aggregate paid claims and claim expenses from a single occurrence of a covered peril exceed the attachment point specified in the contract  up to an amount per loss specified in the contract 
our most significant exposure is to losses from earthquakes and hurricanes and other windstorms  although we are also exposed to claims arising from other catastrophes  such as tsunamis  freezes  floods  fires  tornadoes  explosions and acts of 
table of contents terrorism 
our predominant exposure under such coverage is to property damage 
however  other risks  including business interruption and other non property losses  may also be covered under our property catastrophe reinsurance contracts when arising from a covered peril 
our coverages are offered on either a worldwide basis or are limited to selected geographic areas 
coverage can also vary from all property perils to limited coverage on selected perils  such as earthquake only coverage 
we also enter into retrocessional contracts that provide property catastrophe coverage to other reinsurers or retrocedants 
this coverage is generally in the form of excess of loss retrocessional contracts and may cover all perils and exposures on a worldwide basis or be limited in scope to selected geographic areas  perils and or exposures 
the exposures we assume from retrocessional business can change within a contract term as the underwriters of a retrocedant may alter their book of business after the retrocessional coverage has been bound 
we also offer dual trigger reinsurance contracts which require us to pay claims based on claims incurred by insurers and reinsurers in addition to the estimate of insured industry losses as reported by referenced statistical reporting agencies 
our property catastrophe reinsurance business is generally characterized by loss events of low frequency and high severity 
initial reporting of paid and incurred claims in general  tends to be relatively prompt 
we consider this business short tail as compared to the reporting of claims for long tail products  which tends to be slower 
however  the timing of claims payment and reporting also varies depending on various factors  including whether the claims arise under reinsurance of primary insurance companies or reinsurance of other reinsurance companies  the nature of the events eg  hurricanes  earthquakes or terrorism  the geographic area involved  post event inflation which may cause the cost to repair damaged property to increase significantly from current estimates  or for property claims to remain open for a longer period of time  due to limitations on the supply of building materials  labor and other resources  and the quality of each client s claims management and reserving practices 
management s judgments regarding these factors are reflected in our claims reserve estimates 
reserving for substantially all of our property catastrophe reinsurance business does not involve the use of traditional actuarial techniques 
rather  claims and claim expense reserves are estimated by management after a catastrophe occurs by completing an in depth analysis of the individual contracts which may potentially be impacted by the catastrophic event 
the in depth analysis generally involves estimating the size of insured industry losses from the catastrophic event  reviewing our portfolio of reinsurance contracts to identify those contracts which are exposed to the catastrophic event  reviewing information reported by clients and brokers  discussing the event with our clients and brokers  and estimating the ultimate expected cost to settle all claims and administrative costs arising from the catastrophic event on a contract by contract basis and in aggregate for the event 
once an event has occurred  during the then current reporting period we record our best estimate of the ultimate expected cost to settle all claims arising from the event 
our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves is then determined by deducting cumulative paid losses from our estimate of the ultimate expected loss for an event and our estimate of ibnr is determined by deducting cumulative paid losses  case reserves and additional case reserves from our estimate of the ultimate expected loss for an event 
once we receive a notice of loss or payment request under a catastrophe reinsurance contract  we are generally able to process and pay such claims promptly 
because the events from which claims arise under policies written by our property catastrophe reinsurance business are typically prominent  public occurrences such as hurricanes and earthquakes  we are often able to use independent reports as part of our loss reserve estimation process 
we also review catastrophe bulletins published by various statistical reporting agencies to assist us in determining the size of the industry loss  although these reports may not be available for some time after an event 
in addition to the loss information and estimates communicated by cedants and brokers  we also use industry information which we gather and retain in our rems modeling system 
the information stored in our rems modeling system enables us to analyze each of our policies in relation to a loss and compare our estimate of the loss with those reported by our policyholders 
the rems modeling system also allows us to compare and analyze individual losses reported by policyholders affected by the same loss event 
although the rems modeling system assists with the analysis of the underlying loss and provides us with the information and ability to perform increased analysis  the estimation of claims resulting from catastrophic events is inherently difficult because of the variability and uncertainty associated with property catastrophe claims and the unique characteristics of each loss 

table of contents for smaller events including localized severe weather events such as windstorms  hail  ice  snow  flooding  freezing and tornadoes  which are not necessarily prominent  public occurrences  we initially place greater reliance on catastrophe bulletins published by statistical reporting agencies to assist us in determining what events occurred during the reporting period than we do for large events 
this includes reviewing catastrophe bulletins published by property claim services for us catastrophes 
we set our initial estimates of reserves for claims and claim expenses for these smaller events based on a combination of our historical market share for these types of losses and the estimate of the total insured industry property losses as reported by statistical reporting agencies  although we generally make significant adjustments based on our current exposure to the geographic region involved as well as the size of the loss and the peril involved 
this approach supplements our approach for estimating losses for larger catastrophes  which as discussed above  includes discussions with brokers and ceding companies  reviewing individual contracts impacted by the event  and modeling the loss in our rems system 
in general  our property catastrophe reinsurance reserves for our more recent reinsured catastrophic events are subject to greater uncertainty and  therefore  greater potential variability  and are likely to experience material changes from one period to the next 
this is due to the uncertainty as to the size of the industry losses from the event  uncertainty as to which contracts have been exposed to the catastrophic event  uncertainty due to complex legal and coverage issues that can arise out of large or complex catastrophic events such as the events of september  and hurricane katrina  and uncertainty as to the magnitude of claims incurred by our clients 
as our property catastrophe reinsurance claims age  more information becomes available and we believe our estimates become more certain  although there is no assurance this trend will continue in the future 
as seen in the actual vs 
initial estimated property catastrophe reinsurance claims and claim expense reserve analysis table below  of our inception to date claims and claim expenses in our property catastrophe reinsurance unit were incurred in the  and accident years  due principally to the losses from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan  jeanne  katrina  rita  wilma  gustav and ike 
due to the size and complexity of the losses in these accident years  there still remains significant uncertainty as to the ultimate settlement costs associated with these accident years 
within our property catastrophe reinsurance business  we seek to review substantially all of our claims and claim expense reserves quarterly 
our quarterly review procedures include identifying events that have occurred up to the latest balance sheet date  determining our best estimate of the ultimate expected cost to settle all claims and administrative costs associated with those new events which have arisen during the reporting period  and reviewing the ultimate expected cost to settle claims and administrative costs associated with those events which occurred during previous periods 
this process is judgmental in that it involves reviewing changes in paid and reported losses each period and adjusting our estimates of the ultimate expected losses for each event if there are developments that are different from our previous expectations 
if we determine that adjustments to an earlier estimate are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the twelve months ended december   and  changes to our prior year estimated claims reserves in our property catastrophe reinsurance unit increased our net income by million  increased our net income million  and decreased our net income by million  respectively  excluding the consideration of changes in reinstatement premium  profit commissions  minority interest and income tax expense 
actual results vs 
initial estimates the table below summarizes our initial assumptions and changes in those assumptions for claims and claim expense reserves within our property catastrophe reinsurance unit 
as discussed above  the key assumption in estimating reserves for our property catastrophe reinsurance unit is our estimate of ultimate claims and claim expenses 
the table shows our initial estimates of ultimate claims and claim expenses for each accident year and how these initial estimates have developed over time 
the initial estimate of accident year claims and claim expenses represents our estimate of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims incurred from catastrophic events occurring during a particular accident year  and as reported as of december of that year 
the re estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses as of december   and  represent our revised estimates as reported as of those dates 
the cumulative favorable adverse development shows how our most recent estimates as reported at 
table of contents december  differ from our initial accident year estimates 
favorable development implies that our current estimates are lower than our initial estimates while adverse development implies that our current estimates are higher than our original estimates 
total reserves as of december  reflect the unpaid portion of our estimates of ultimate claims and claim expenses 
the table is presented on a gross basis and therefore does not include the benefit of reinsurance recoveries 
it also does not consider the impact of loss related premium or davincire minority interest 
actual vs 
initial estimated property catastrophe reinsurance claims and claim expense reserve analysis in thousands  except percentages accident year initial estimate of accident year claims and claim expenses re estimated claims and claim expenses as of december  cumulative favorable adverse development decrease increase of current ultimate claims and claim expense reserves as of december  of claims and claim expenses unpaid as of december  as quantified in the table above  since the inception of the company in we have experienced million of cumulative favorable development on the run off of our gross reserves within our property catastrophe reinsurance unit 
this represents of our initial estimated gross claims and claim expenses for accident years and prior of billion and is calculated based on our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves as of december   compared to our initial estimates of ultimate claims and claim expenses  as of the end of each accident year 
as described above  given the complexity in reserving for claims and claims expenses associated with catastrophe losses for property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance contracts  we have experienced development  both favorable and unfavorable  in any given accident year in amounts that exceed our inception to date percentage of 
for example  our accident year developed favorably by million  which is better than our initial estimates of claims and claim expenses for the accident year as estimated as of december   while our accident year developed unfavorably by million  or 
on a net basis our cumulative favorable or unfavorable development is generally reduced by offsetting changes in our reinsurance recoverables  as well as changes to loss related premiums such as reinstatement premiums  and minority interest for changes in claims and claim expenses that impact davincire  all of which generally move in the opposite direction to changes in our ultimate claims and claim expenses 
the percentage of claims unpaid at december  for each accident year reflects both the speed at which claims and claim expenses for each accident year have been paid and our estimate of claims and claim expenses for that accident year 
as seen above  claims and claim expenses for the accident year have to date been paid quickly compared to prior accident years 
this is due to the fact that hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne which occurred in have been rapid claims paying events 
this is driven in part by the mix of our business in florida  which primarily includes property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance for personal lines property coverage  rather than commercial 
table of contents property coverage or retrocessional coverage  and the speed of the settlement and payment of claims by our underlying cedants 
in contrast  our accident year  which includes losses from the events of september   and our accident year  which includes significant losses from hurricane katrina  includes a higher mix of commercial business and retrocessional coverage where the underlying claims of our cedants tend to be settled and paid more slowly 
in addition  claims from our underlying cedants for the and accident years are subject to more complex coverage and legal matters due to the complexity of the catastrophic events taking place in those years 
sensitivity analysis the table below shows the impact on our ultimate claims and claim expenses  net income and shareholders equity as of and for the year ended december  of reasonably likely changes to our estimates of ultimate losses for claims and claim expenses incurred from catastrophic events within our property catastrophe reinsurance business unit 
the reasonably likely changes are based on an historical analysis of the period to period variability of our ultimate costs to settle claims from catastrophic events  giving due consideration to changes in our reserving practices over time 
in general  our claim reserves for our more recent catastrophic events are subject to greater uncertainty and  therefore  greater variability and are likely to experience material changes from one period to the next 
this is due to the uncertainty as to the size of the industry losses from the event  uncertainty as to which contracts have been exposed to the catastrophic event  and uncertainty as to the magnitude of claims incurred by our clients 
as our claim reserves age  more information becomes available and we believe our estimates become more certain  although there is no assurance this trend will continue in the future 
as a result  the sensitivity analysis below is based on the age of each accident year  our current estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses for the catastrophic events occurring in each accident year  and the reasonably likely variability of our current estimates of claims and claim expenses by accident year

while we believe these are reasonably likely outcomes  we do not believe the reader should consider the above sensitivity analysis an actuarial reserve range 
in addition  the sensitivity analysis only reflects reasonably likely changes in our underlying assumptions 
it is possible that our estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses could be significantly higher or lower than the sensitivity analysis described above 
for example  we could be liable for events for which we have not estimated claims and claim expenses or for exposures we do not currently believe are covered under our policies 
these changes could result in significantly larger changes to our estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses  net income and shareholders equity than those noted above 
we also caution the reader that the above sensitivity analysis is not used by management in developing our reserve estimates and is also not used by management in managing the business 

table of contents specialty reinsurance within our specialty reinsurance business unit we write a number of reinsurance lines such as catastrophe exposed workers compensation  surety  terrorism  medical malpractice  catastrophe exposed personal lines property  casualty clash  property per risk  catastrophe exposed personal lines property and other specialty lines of reinsurance  which we collectively refer to as specialty reinsurance 
we offer our specialty reinsurance products principally on an excess of loss basis  as described above with respect to our property catastrophe reinsurance products  and we also provide some proportional coverage 
in a proportional reinsurance arrangement also referred to as quota share reinsurance or pro rata reinsurance  the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the original premiums and losses of the reinsured 
we offer our specialty reinsurance products to insurance companies and other reinsurance companies and provide coverage for specific geographic regions or on a worldwide basis 
we expanded our specialty reinsurance business in and have increased our presence in the specialty reinsurance market since that time 
our specialty reinsurance business can generally be characterized as providing coverage for low frequency and high severity losses  similar to our property catastrophe reinsurance business 
as with our property catastrophe reinsurance business  our specialty reinsurance contracts frequently provide coverage for relatively large limits or exposures 
as a result of the foregoing  our specialty reinsurance business is subject to significant claims volatility 
in periods of low claims frequency or severity  our results will generally be favorably impacted while in periods of high claims frequency or severity our results will generally be negatively impacted 
our processes and methodologies in respect of loss estimation for the coverages we offer through our specialty reinsurance operation differ from those used for our property catastrophe oriented coverages 
for example  our specialty reinsurance coverages are more likely to be impacted by factors such as long term inflation and changes in the social and legal environment  which we believe gives rise to greater uncertainty in our claims reserves 
moreover  in reserving for our specialty reinsurance coverages we do not have the benefit of a significant amount of our own historical experience in these lines 
we believe this makes our specialty reinsurance reserving subject to greater uncertainty than our property catastrophe reinsurance unit 
when initially developing our reserving techniques for our specialty reinsurance coverages  we considered estimating reserves utilizing several actuarial techniques such as paid and incurred development methods 
we elected to use the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial technique because this method is appropriate for lines of business  such as our specialty reinsurance business  where there is a lack of historical claims experience 
this method allows for greater weight to be applied to expected results in periods where little or no actual experience is available  and  hence  is less susceptible to the potential pitfall of being excessively swayed by one year or one quarter of actual paid and or reported loss data 
this method uses initial expected loss ratio expectations to the extent that losses are not paid or reported  and it assumes that past experience is not fully representative of the future 
as the company s reserves for claims and claim expenses age  and actual claims experience becomes available  this method places less weight on expected experience and places more weight on actual experience 
we reevaluate our actuarial reserving techniques on a periodic basis 
the utilization of the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial technique requires us to estimate an expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio and select an expected loss reporting pattern 
we select our estimates of the expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and expected loss reporting patterns by reviewing industry standards and adjusting these standards based upon the terms of the coverages we offer 
the estimated expected claims and claim expense ratio may be modified to the extent that reported losses at a given point in time differ from what would be expected based on the selected loss reporting pattern 
our estimate of ibnr is the product of the premium we have earned  the initial expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio and the percentage of estimated unreported losses 
in addition  certain of our specialty reinsurance coverages may be impacted by natural and man made catastrophes 
we estimate claim reserves for these losses after the event giving rise to these losses occur  following a process that is similar to our property catastrophe reinsurance unit described above 

table of contents within our specialty reinsurance business  we seek to review substantially all of our claims and claim expense reserves quarterly 
typically  our quarterly review procedures include reviewing paid and reported claims in the most recent reporting period  reviewing the development of paid and reported claims from prior periods  and reviewing our overall experience by underwriting year and in the aggregate 
we monitor our expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and expected loss reporting assumptions on a quarterly basis and compare them to our actual experience 
these actuarial assumptions are generally reviewed annually  based on input from our actuaries  underwriters  claims personnel and finance professionals  although adjustments may be made more frequently if needed 
assumption changes are made to adjust for changes in the pricing and terms of coverage we provide  changes in industry standards  as well as our actual experience  to the extent we have enough data to rely on our own experience 
if we determine that adjustments to an earlier estimate are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the twelve months ended december   and  changes to our prior year estimated claims reserves in our specialty reinsurance unit increased our net income by million  million and million  respectively  excluding the consideration of changes in reinstatement premium  profit commissions  davincire minority interest and income tax expense 
actual results vs 
initial estimates the actual vs 
initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio table below summarizes our key actuarial assumptions in reserving for our specialty reinsurance business 
as noted above  the key actuarial assumptions include the estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and the estimated loss reporting patterns 
the table shows our initial estimates of the ultimate claims and claim expense ratio by underwriting year 
the table shows how our initial estimates of these ratios have developed over time  with the re estimated ratios reflecting a combination of the amount and timing of paid and reported losses compared to our initial estimates 
the initial estimate is based on the actuarial assumptions that were in place at the end of that year 
a decrease in the ultimate claims and claim expense ratio implies that our current estimates are lower than our initial estimates while an increase in the ultimate claims and claim expense ratio implies that our current estimates are higher than our initial estimates 
the result would be a corresponding favorable impact on shareholders equity and net income or a corresponding unfavorable impact on shareholders equity and net income  respectively 
the table also shows how our initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios have changed from one underwriting year to the next 
the table below reflects a summary of the weighted average assumptions for all classes of business written within our specialty reinsurance unit 
the table is presented on a gross loss basis and therefore does not include the benefit of reinsurance recoveries or loss related premium

initial estimated specialty reinsurance claims and claim expense reserve analysis estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses ratio underwriting year initial estimate re estimate as of december  december  december  the table above shows our initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios for attritional losses for each new underwriting year within our specialty reinsurance unit as of the end of each calendar year 
until  our initial estimated ultimate remained relatively constant between in and in and this reflects the fact that management had not made significant changes to its initial estimates of expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratios from one underwriting year to the next 
the principal reason for the modest changes from one underwriting year to the next is that the mix of business 
table of contents has changed 
for example  the mix of business for the and underwriting years have a lower initial expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio than in prior years as it is more heavily weighted to business that is expected to produce a lower level of losses 
the decrease in the initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio from to also reflects assumption changes made for certain classes of business where our experience  and the industry experience in general  has been better than expected and  as a result  we decreased our initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio for these classes of business 
as each underwriting year has developed  our re estimated expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratios have changed 
in particular  our re estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios have decreased significantly from the initial estimates for the through underwriting years 
this was principally due to our reserve review 
during our reserve review  we further segmented the specialty business with the aim of grouping risks into more homogeneous categories which respond to the evolution of actual exposures 
this became possible as the volume of this business increased over the three preceding years 
this further segmentation required the selection of loss reporting patterns to be applied to these new groups 
we also updated our assumptions for our original loss reporting patterns based on a combination of new industry information and actual experience accumulated over the three preceding years 
the assumptions for the new loss reporting patterns were applied to all prior underwriting years 
in addition  we made explicit allowances for commuted contracts whereas previously these were considered in the overall reserving assumptions 
we also reviewed substantially all of our case reserves and additional case reserves 
the result of the foregoing was a decrease in our specialty reinsurance re estimated ultimate claims and claim expense reserves in subsequent to this reserve review  the results of our specialty book of business have been mixed 
the underwriting year includes favorable development as actual paid and reported losses during have been less than expected  which has resulted in a reduction in our expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio for this year 
however  the and underwriting years have performed worse than expected and our current estimates are significantly higher than our initial estimates 
this is due in part to the losses in our casualty clash line of business in and  associated with exposure to the deterioration of the credit and capital markets in as well the madoff matter discovered in the fourth quarter of and with sub prime exposure in as noted above  our specialty reinsurance business is characterized by events of low frequency and high severity which results in actual experience that can be significantly better or worse than long term trends or industry standards may imply 
as noted above  some of our specialty reinsurance contracts are exposed to net claims and claim expenses from large natural and man made catastrophes 
net claims and claim expenses from these large catastrophes are reserved for after the events which gave rise to the claims in a manner which is consistent with our property catastrophe reinsurance reserving practices as discussed above 
the large catastrophes occurring during the period from to impacting our specialty unit principally include hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  which occurred in our estimate of ultimate net claims and claim expenses from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  within our specialty reinsurance unit  net of reinsurance recoveries and assumed and ceded loss related premium  totaled million  million  million and million at december    and  respectively

while we believe these are reasonably likely changes  we do not believe the reader should consider the above sensitivity analysis an actuarial reserve range 
in addition  we caution the reader that the above sensitivity analysis only reflects reasonably likely changes 
it is possible that our initial estimated claims and claim expense ratios and loss reporting patterns could be significantly different from the sensitivity analysis described above

these changes could result in significantly larger changes to reserves for claims and claim expenses  net income and shareholders equity than those noted above 
we also caution the reader that the above sensitivity analysis is not used by management in developing our reserve estimates and is also not used by management in managing the business 
individual risk segment we define our individual risk segment to include underwriting that involves understanding the characteristics of the underlying insurance policy 
our principal contracts include insurance policies and quota share reinsurance with respect to risks including multi peril crop  which includes multi peril crop insurance  crop hail and other named peril agriculture risk management products  commercial property  which principally includes catastrophe exposed commercial property products  commercial multi line  which includes commercial property and liability coverage  such as general liability  automobile liability and physical damage  building and contents  professional liability and various specialty products  and personal lines property  which principally includes homeowners personal lines property coverage and catastrophe exposed personal lines property coverage 

table of contents we use the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial technique to estimate claims and claim expenses within our individual risk segment 
the comments discussed above relating to our reserving techniques and processes for our specialty reinsurance unit also apply to our individual risk segment 
in addition  certain of our coverages may be impacted by natural and man made catastrophes

the principal reason for the changes from one year to the next is that the mix of business has changed 
for example  during  our initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio increased relative to the preceding five years  as a result of the increase in our multi peril crop insurance line of business which has a higher net claims and claim expenses ratio relative to the other lines of business within the individual risk segment and comprises a larger percentage of our overall individual risk premiums 
as each accident year has developed  our re estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios have generally been reduced 
this reflects the impact of actual experience in our individual risk 
table of contents business where actual paid and reported losses to date for attritional losses are less than originally expected 
as described above  under the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial technique less weight is placed on initial estimates and more weight is placed on actual experience as our claims and claim expense reserves age 
as noted above  some of our individual risk contracts are exposed to net claims and claim expenses from large natural and man made catastrophes 
net claims and claim expenses from these large catastrophes are reserved for after the event which gave rise to the claims in a manner which is consistent with our property catastrophe reinsurance reserving practices as discussed above

while we believe these are reasonably likely changes  we do not believe the reader should consider the above sensitivity analysis an actuarial reserve range 
in addition  we caution the reader that the above sensitivity analysis only reflects reasonably likely changes 
it is possible that our initial estimated claims and claim expense ratios and loss reporting patterns could be significantly different from the sensitivity analysis described above 
for example  we could be liable for events which we have not estimated reserves for or for exposures we do not currently think are covered under our contracts 
these changes could result in significantly larger changes to our reserves for claims and claim expenses  net income and shareholders equity than those noted above 
we also caution the reader that the above sensitivity analysis is not used by management in developing our reserve estimates and is also not used by management in managing the business 
losses recoverable we enter into reinsurance agreements in order to help reduce our exposure to large losses and to help manage our risk portfolio 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims and claim expense reserves associated with the related assumed reinsurance 
for multi year retrospectively rated contracts  we accrue amounts either assets or liabilities that are due to or from assuming companies based on estimated contract experience 
if we determine that adjustments to earlier estimates are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are determined 
the estimate of losses recoverable can be more subjective than estimating the underlying claims and claim expense reserves as discussed under the heading claims and claim expense reserves above 
in particular  losses recoverable may be affected by deemed inuring reinsurance  industry losses reported by various statistical reporting services  and other factors 
losses recoverable on dual trigger reinsurance contracts require us to estimate our ultimate losses applicable to these contracts as well as estimate the 
table of contents ultimate amount of insured losses for the industry as a whole that will be reported by the applicable statistical reporting agency  as per the contract terms 
in addition  the level of our additional case reserves and ibnr reserves has a significant impact on losses recoverable 
these factors can impact the amount and timing of the losses recoverable to be recorded 
the majority of the balance we have accrued as recoverable will not be due for collection until some point in the future 
the amounts recoverable ultimately collected are open to uncertainty due to the ultimate ability and willingness of reinsurers to pay our claims  for reasons including insolvency and elective run off  contractual dispute and various other reasons 
in addition  because the majority of the balances recoverable will not be collected for some time  economic conditions as well as the financial and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may change  and these changes may affect the reinsurer s willingness and ability to meet their contractual obligations to us 
to reflect these uncertainties  we estimate and record a valuation allowance for potential uncollectible losses recoverable which reduces losses recoverable and net earnings 
we estimate our valuation allowance by applying specific percentages against each recovery based on our counterparty s credit rating 
the percentages applied are based on historical industry default statistics developed by major rating agencies and are then adjusted by us based on industry knowledge and our judgment and estimates 
we also apply case specific valuation allowances against certain recoveries that we deem unlikely to be collected in full 
we then evaluate the overall adequacy of the valuation allowance based on other qualitative and judgmental factors 
the valuation allowance recorded against losses recoverable was million at december  million 
the reinsurers with the three largest balances accounted for  and  respectively  of our losses recoverable balance at december   and  respectively 
the three largest company specific components of the valuation allowance represented  and of our total valuation allowance at december   and 
fair value measurements and impairments fair value the use of fair value to measure certain assets and liabilities with resulting unrealized gains or losses  is pervasive within our financial statements  and is a critical accounting policy and estimate for us 
fair value is the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between open market participants at the measurement date 
we recognize unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in fair value in our statements of operations  with the exception of unrealized gains and losses on our fixed maturity investments available for sale  which currently are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
the degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates with the level of observable pricing inputs 
financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets require less judgment in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments traded in other than active markets or that do not have quoted prices have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment 
observable pricing inputs are affected by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established  and the characteristics specific to the transaction and general market conditions 
under fas  assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet are classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three levels based on the observability of inputs available to measure the fair value 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under fas are described below fair values determined by level inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices obtained from active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has access to 
the fair value is determined by multiplying the quoted price by the quantity held by the company  
table of contents fair values determined by level inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability  such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals  broker quotes and certain pricing indices  and level inputs are based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  and include situations where there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability 
in these cases  significant management assumptions can be used to establish management s best estimate of the assumptions used by other market participants in determining the fair value of the asset or liability 
see note fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about fair value measurements 
below is a summary of the assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december  total quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level significant other observable inputs level significant unobservable inputs level in thousands assets fixed maturity investments available for sale short term investments other investments other secured assets other liabilities and assets percentage of total fair value assets and liabilities other assets of million  million and million are included in level  level and level  respectively 
other liabilities of million  million and million are included in level  level and level  respectively 
as at december   we classified million and million of assets and liabilities  respectively  at fair value on a recurring basis using level inputs 
this represented and of our total assets and liabilities  respectively 
level fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable 
these measurements are made under circumstances in which there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability 
we use valuation models or other pricing techniques that require a variety of inputs including contractual terms  market prices and rates  yield curves  credit curves  measures of volatility  prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs  some of which may be unobservable  to value these level assets and liabilities 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment 
in making the assessment  we considered factors specific to the asset or liability 
in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value of an asset or a liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety is classified is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability 
impairments fixed maturity investments available for sale on a quarterly basis we assess whether declines in the fair value of our fixed maturity investments available for sale represent impairments that are other than temporary 
there are several factors that we consider in the assessment of a security  which include i the time period during which there has been a significant 
table of contents decline below cost  ii the extent of the decline below cost  iii our intent and ability to hold the security  iv the potential for the security to recover in value  v an analysis of the financial condition of the issuer and vi an analysis of the collateral structure and credit support of the security  if applicable 
where we have determined that there is an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the security  the cost of the security is written down to its fair value and the unrealized loss at the time of determination is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
after recording the other than temporary impairment charges  we then must determine which investments are impaired due to issuer credit risk 
for investments which we do not expect to collect the full principal amount of the investment at maturity  we do not accrete the discount to par of these investments 
for those impairments which are driven by other factors  such as changes in interest rates  we accrete the discount to par over the remaining expected average life of the investment as we expect to collect our principal if such investment is held to maturity 
the majority of our fixed maturity investments available for sale are currently managed by external investment managers in accordance with specific investment mandates and guidelines 
the investment managers are currently directed to manage our investments to maximize total investment return in accordance with these investment mandates and guidelines 
while we have adequate capital and liquidity to support our operations and to hold our fixed maturity investments available for sale which are in an unrealized loss position until they recover in value  we have not prohibited or restricted our investment managers from selling these investments and our investment managers actively trade our investments 
we are therefore unable to represent or certify that we have the intent or ability to hold these investments until they recover in value 
as a consequence  we have impaired principally all of our fixed maturity investments available for sale that were in an unrealized loss position at each quarterly reporting date throughout the three years presented 
during the year ended december   the company recorded million in other than temporary impairment charges million  million including impairment charges for which we believe we will not be able to recover the full principal amount if the impaired security is held to maturity  of million nil  million 
as of december  and  the company had essentially no fixed maturity investments available for sale in an unrealized loss position 
investments in other ventures  under equity method investments in which we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are classified as investments in other ventures  under equity method  and are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
under this method  the company records its proportionate share of income or loss from such investments in its results for the period 
any decline in the value of investments in other ventures  under equity method  including goodwill and other intangible assets arising upon acquisition of the investee  considered by management to be other than temporary  is impaired and is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which it is determined 
as of december   the company had million million in investments in other ventures  under equity method on its consolidated balance sheets  including million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets nil and nil 
in determining whether an equity method investment is impaired  we look at a variety of factors including the operating and financial performance of the investee  the investee s future business plans and projections  recent transactions and market valuations of publicly traded companies where available  and our intent and ability to hold the investment until it recovers in value 
in doing this  we make assumptions and estimates in assessing whether an impairment has occurred and if  in the future  our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of these investments change  this could result in a material decrease in the carrying value of these investments 
this would cause us to write down the carrying value of these investments and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period the impairment charge is taken 
during the year ended december   the company recorded million nil  nil in other than temporary impairment charges related to investments in other ventures  under the equity method 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets acquired are initially recorded at fair value 
subsequent to initial recognition  finite lived other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life  subject to impairment  and goodwill and indefinite lived other intangible assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
if goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired  they are written down to their estimated fair values with a corresponding expense reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 
we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for purposes of the annual impairment evaluation  goodwill is assigned to the applicable reporting unit of the acquired entities giving rise to the goodwill and other intangible assets are tested based on the cash flows they produce 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculation 
principally  we identify the reporting unit or business entity that the goodwill or other intangible asset is attributed to  and review historical and forecasted operating and financial performance and other underlying factors affecting such analysis  including market conditions 
other assumptions used could produce significantly different results which may result in a change in the value of goodwill or our other intangible assets and related charge in our consolidated statements of operations 
an impairment charge could be recognized in the event of a significant decline in the implied fair value of those operations where the goodwill or other intangible assets are applicable 
as at december   our consolidated balance sheets include million of goodwill million and million of other intangible assets million 
impairment charges were nil during nil  nil 
premiums we recognize premiums as revenue over the terms of the related contracts and policies 
our written premiums are based on policy and contract terms and include estimates based on information received from both insureds and ceding companies 
the information received is typically in the form of bordereaux  broker notifications and or discussions with ceding companies or their broker 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of written premium including adjustment and reinstatement premium  earned premium  acquisition costs and ceding commissions 
we generally recognize premium on the date the contract is bound  even if the contract provides for an effective date prior to the date the contract is bound  thus preventing premature revenue recognition 
the date the contract is bound is usually the date we are on risk for the policy and this is generally the date on which the reinsurance slip is signed 
the signing of the reinsurance contract normally occurs after the date the slip is signed 
we book premiums on non proportional contracts in accordance with the contract terms 
premiums written on losses occurring contracts are typically earned over the contract period 
premiums on risks attaching contracts are either estimated or earned as reported by the cedants  which may be over a period more than twice as long as the contract period 
for multi year policies  only the initial annual premium is included as written at policy inception 
the remaining annual premiums are included as written at each successive anniversary date within the multi year term 
management is required to make estimates based on judgment and historical experience for periods during which information has not yet been received 
in our individual risk business  it is often necessary to estimate portions of premiums written from quota share contracts and by third party program managers and the related commission expense 
management estimates these amounts based on discussions with ceding companies and third party program managers  together with historical experience and judgment 
total premiums written estimated in our individual risk business at december   and were million  million and million  respectively  and total estimated premiums earned were million  million and million  respectively 
total earned commissions estimated at december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
management tracks the actual premium received and commissions incurred and compares this to the estimates previously booked 
such estimates are subject to adjustment in subsequent periods when actual figures are recorded 
to date such subsequent adjustments have not been material 

table of contents since premiums for our reinsurance segment are contractually driven and the reporting lag for such premiums is minimal  estimates for premiums written for this segment are usually not significant 
the minimum and deposit premiums on excess policies are usually set forth in the language of the contract and are used to record premiums on these policies 
actual premiums are determined in subsequent periods based on actual exposures and any adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
reinstatement premiums are estimated after the occurrence of a significant loss and are recorded in accordance with the contract terms based upon paid losses and case reserves 
reinstatement premiums are earned when written 
ceded premiums are also recognized on the date the contract is bound and are deducted from gross premiums written  to arrive at net premiums written 
ceded premiums are earned over the terms of the related contracts and policies  and are reflected as a reduction to gross premiums earned to arrive at net premiums earned 
income taxes income taxes have been provided in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  on those operations which are subject to income tax 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
such temporary differences are primarily due to the tax basis discount on unpaid losses and loss expenses  unearned premium reserves  net operating loss carryforwards  intangible assets  accrued expenses  deferred policy acquisition costs and certain investments 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded if it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the benefits related to deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december   our net deferred tax asset and valuation allowance were million million and million million  respectively see note of the consolidated financial statements for more information 
at each balance sheet date  we assess the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces the net deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income from each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction 
in  and  we generated cumulative taxable income in our us tax paying subsidiaries which was offset by the utilization of a net operating loss carryforward 
during and  our valuation allowance was reassessed and we now believe that it is more likely than not that we will continue to generate taxable income in our us tax paying subsidiaries and therefore be able to recover all of our us net deferred tax asset 
as a result  we reduced our valuation allowance for the years ending december  and december  by million and million  respectively 
this resulted in a corresponding increase to net income in and  respectively 
projections of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions of future business and operations that are likely to differ from actual experience

net negative impact is based on management s estimates following a review of our potential exposures and discussions with our counterparties 
given the magnitude and recent occurrence of these events  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  several of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates 
in addition  actual losses from these events may increase if the company s reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations 
actual losses from these events will likely vary  perhaps materially  from these current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  including the preliminary nature of the available information  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  the effects of any demand surge on claims activity and complex coverage and other legal issues

ceded premiums written year ended december  in thousands ceded premiums written reinsurance segment 
table of contents due to the potential volatility of the property catastrophe reinsurance contracts which we sell  we purchase reinsurance to reduce our exposure to large losses and to help manage our risk portfolio 
we use our rems modeling system to evaluate how each purchase interacts with our portfolio of reinsurance contracts we write  and with the other ceded reinsurance contracts we purchase  to determine the appropriateness of the pricing of each contract and whether or not it helps us to balance our portfolio of risks 
ceded premiums written increased by million in  primarily as a result of the company electing to purchase additional reinsurance protection due to appropriately priced coverage being available during and partially offset by the company electing to not participate in a fully collateralized joint venture due to a decrease in demand for these vehicles in compared to ceded premiums written decreased by million in  primarily as a result of the company s decreased utilization of fully collateralized joint ventures during in  the company assumed million of catastrophe reinsurance premium which was fully ceded to its fully collateralized joint ventures  primarily starbound ii  compared to  where million of assumed catastrophe reinsurance premium was fully ceded to starbound re and tim re 
the decrease in premium ceded to fully collateralized joint ventures was due to a decrease in demand for these vehicles in compared to ceded premiums written increased by million in  primarily as a result of the utilization in the us hurricane season of two fully collateralized joint ventures  starbound re and tim re  pursuant to which million of assumed catastrophe reinsurance premium was fully ceded to those entities 
to the extent that appropriately priced coverage is available  we anticipate continued use of reinsurance to reduce the impact of large losses on our financial results and to manage our portfolio of risk  however  the buying of ceded reinsurance in our reinsurance segment is based on market opportunities and is not based on placing a specific reinsurance program each year 
in addition  in future periods we may utilize the growing market for cat linked securities to expand our ceded reinsurance buying if we find the pricing and terms of such coverages attractive

our prior year reserves experienced million  million and million of net favorable development in  and  respectively 
for  the favorable prior year reserve development was principally the result of a reduction in ultimate net losses associated with the hurricanes  katrina  rita and wilma 
the favorable prior year reserve development in was principally attributable to a reduction in our catastrophe unit ultimate losses related to the and accident years  combined with continued lower than expected claims emergence in our specialty unit 
the favorable prior year reserve development in was principally driven by our specialty reinsurance unit as a result of the application of our formulaic reserving methodology for this book of business with the reductions being due to actual paid and reported loss activity being better than what we anticipated when setting the initial ibnr reserves 
in addition  within our specialty reinsurance unit  million of the favorable development in was driven by a reduction in carried reserves due to commutations 
losses from our property catastrophe reinsurance and specialty reinsurance policies can be infrequent  but severe  as demonstrated by our results compared to and during periods with low levels of property catastrophe loss activity  such as and  we have the potential to produce a low level of losses and a related increase in underwriting income 
as described above  we believe there has been an increase in the frequency and severity of hurricanes that have the potential to make landfall in the us  potentially as a result of decadal ocean water temperature cyclical trends  a longer term trend towards global warming  or both or other factors 
our underwriting expenses consist of acquisition expenses and operational expenses 
acquisition expenses consist of the costs to acquire premiums and are principally comprised of broker commissions and excise taxes 
acquisition expenses are driven by contract terms and are normally a set percentage of premiums and  accordingly  these costs will normally move in line with the fluctuation in gross premiums earned 
in  the acquisition expense ratio of was slightly lower than the recorded in in  the acquisition expense ratio was 
operating expenses consist of salaries and other general and administrative expenses 
in  operating expenses increased million to million primarily as a result of increased headcount and the related increase in compensation  general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses decreased by million to million in when compared to  principally due to the company reviewing and updating its methodology for allocating certain operating expenses combined with an increase in fee income as discussed below 
our operating expense ratio may increase over time  as a result of factors including the absolute and comparative growth of our operating expenses  further refinements to internal expense allocations  and market trends and dynamics 
we have entered into joint ventures and specialized quota share cessions of our book of business 
in accordance with the joint venture and quota share agreements  we are entitled to certain fee income and profit commissions

these fees totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively and resulted in a corresponding decrease to the underwriting expense ratio of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  we are entitled to certain fee income and profit commissions from davinci

with the acquisition of the net assets of agro national  llc in we intend to invest in this line of business and plan to continue to increase our gross premiums written for this business  subject to market conditions 
the premium and underwriting results associated with this business can be volatile  driven principally by changes in commodity prices and weather events in the us which impacts the price and yield of the insured crops and correspondingly also impacts the premium charged for the policies issued and the net claims and claim expenses incurred

the reduction in prior years estimated ultimate net claims reserves was principally driven by the application of our formulaic reserving methodology used for the individual risk book of business and is primarily due to actual paid and reported loss activity being better than what we had anticipated when estimating the initial ultimate claims and claims expense ratios and the initial loss reporting patterns 
in addition  during we revised our reported loss development patterns for several of our liability lines of business to reflect the company s actual experience to date with these lines 
the impact of this was a million reduction in prior year reserves 
our underwriting expenses consist of acquisition expenses and operational expenses 
acquisition expenses consist of costs to acquire premiums and are comprised of fees and expenses paid to third party program managers  who source primary insurance premiums for us through specialized programs  primary insurers  for whom we write quota share reinsurance  and broker commissions and excise taxes paid to brokers  who source insurance for us on a risk by risk basis 
acquisition expenses are driven by contract terms and are generally determined based on a set percentage of premiums 
acquisition expenses as a percentage of net premiums earned decreased in to  compared to and in and  respectively 
the decrease in the acquisition expense ratio is principally a result of our multi peril crop line of business having a relatively lower expense ratio when compared to other lines of business and increasing as a percentage of gross premiums written by our individual risk segment 
in addition  certain components of underwriting expenses that were incurred in with respect to the multi peril crop business are no longer reflected due to our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of agro national  llc  the agency that produces this business  in the second quarter of operating expenses consist of compensation and other general and administrative expenses 
our individual risk business historically operated with a relatively small number of employees and  accordingly  we have outsourced much of the administration in our individual risk business to third party program managers and third party administrators  however we continuously monitor and analyze opportunities to internalize such services  such as with glencoe claims 
operating expenses in our individual risk segment remained relatively flat at million in compared to million in  and million in as noted above  we have been investing in our multi peril crop insurance business as well as certain other lines of business and we currently expect our operating expenses to increase  both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net premiums earned  in

the results from the company s other investments described above include net unrealized losses of million in  compared to net unrealized gains of million in the fair value of certain of our other investments  which principally include hedge funds  private equity partnerships  senior secured bank loan funds and non us fixed income funds  is generally established on the basis of the net valuation criteria established by the managers of such investments  if applicable 
these net valuations are determined based upon the valuation criteria established by the governing documents of such investments 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had ready markets existed for the shares  partnership interests or notes 
many of our fund investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales which are determined by the governing documents and limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
in addition  due to a lag in reporting  some of our fund managers  fund administrators  or both  are unable to provide final fund valuations as of our current reporting date 
in these circumstances  we estimate the fair value of these funds by starting with the prior month s or quarter s fund valuation  adjusting these valuations for capital calls  redemptions or distributions and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and then estimating the return for the current period 
in circumstances in which we estimate the return for the current period  we use all credible information available to us 
this principally includes preliminary estimates reported to us by our fund managers  obtaining the valuation of underlying portfolio investments where such underlying investments are publicly traded and therefore have a readily observable price  using information that is available to us with respect to the underlying investments  reviewing various indices for similar investments or asset classes  as well as estimating returns based on the results of similar types of investments for which we have reported results  or other valuation methods  as necessary 
actual final fund valuations may differ from our estimates  perhaps materially so  and these differences are recorded in the period they become known as a change in estimate 
our estimate of the fair value of catastrophe bonds are based on quoted market prices  or when such prices are not available  by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications 

table of contents net investment income from fixed maturity investments available for sale increased million to million in compared to million in due to higher returns on these investments due in part to a widening of credit spreads 
net investment income from short term investments decreased million in to million from million in  principally due to a decrease in short term interest rates as well as a decrease in average balances for these investments as a result of our share repurchases during net investment income increased by million to million in  compared to million in the increase in net investment income in and was a result of both higher investment returns and an increasing level of average invested assets in and the increase in invested assets is due to the positive cash flow generated from our operating activities which we generated in and  and which we have deployed into our invested assets 
our other investments  which include hedge funds  private equity funds and other alternative investments  generated million of net investment income in compared to million in the recent reduction in the federal funds rate by the board of governors of the federal reserve board and corresponding decline in interest rates as well as the overall poor economic conditions and turmoil in the financial and investment markets will likely continue to put downward pressure on our net investment income for the foreseeable future 
net realized losses gains on investments year ended december  in thousands gross realized gains gross realized losses other than temporary impairments net realized losses gains on investments our investment portfolio is structured to preserve capital and provide us with a high level of liquidity 
a large majority of our investments are invested in the fixed income markets and  therefore  our realized holding gains and losses on investments are highly correlated to fluctuations in interest rates 
therefore  as interest rates decline  we will tend to have realized gains from the turnover of our investment portfolio  and as interest rates rise  we will tend to have realized losses from the turnover of our investment portfolio 
net realized investment gains and losses totaled million and million  respectively  during  compared to million and million  respectively  in included in net realized losses gains are million and million of other than temporary impairment charges related to fixed maturity investments available for sale in and  respectively 
other than temporary impairments in were driven by the turmoil in the financial markets and widening credit spreads 
during  our million of other than temporary impairment charges was a result of a falling interest rate environment during the year which resulted in lower unrealized losses on our fixed maturity securities  prior to the recognition of other than temporary impairment losses on such securities 
credit related other than temporary impairment charges totaled million and nil for and  respectively 
the credit related other than temporary impairment charges in  which includes impairments for which the company believes it will not be able to recover the full principal amount if held to maturity  were principally driven by our direct holdings of fixed maturity securities issued by lehman brothers 
the company had essentially no fixed maturity investments available for sale in an unrealized loss position at december

the average interest rate on this borrowing was  therefore lower than the coupon rate on the senior notes

income tax expense benefit year ended december  in thousands income tax expense benefit we are subject to income taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate  however  since the majority of our income is currently earned in bermuda  a non taxable jurisdiction  the tax impact to our operations has historically been minimal 
in  and  we generated cumulative taxable income in our us tax paying subsidiaries 
this taxable income was offset by the utilization of a net operating loss carryforward 
during and  our valuation allowance was reassessed and we now believe that it is more likely than not that we will continue to generate taxable income in our us tax paying insurance subsidiaries and therefore be able to recover all of our us net deferred tax asset 
as a result  our valuation allowance was reduced by million and million in and  respectively  and there was a corresponding decrease to income tax expense and increase to our net income 
this resulted in an income tax benefit in our valuation allowance totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the remaining valuation allowance as of december  relates exclusively to our operations in ireland 
the income tax expense in primarily relates to alternative minimum taxes incurred by our us subsidiaries 
we expect our consolidated effective tax rate to increase in the future  as our global operations expand 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition renaissancere is a holding company  and we therefore rely on dividends from our subsidiaries and investment income to make principal and interest payments on our debt and to make dividend payments to our preference and common shareholders 
the payment of dividends by our us and bermuda subsidiaries is  under certain circumstances  limited under us statutory regulations and bermuda insurance law  which require our us and bermuda insurance subsidiaries to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity 
in addition  bermuda regulations require approval from the bma for any reduction of capital in excess of of statutory capital  as defined in the insurance act 
at december   the statutory capital and surplus of our bermuda insurance subsidiaries was billion billion  and the amount of capital and surplus required to be maintained was million million 
during  renaissance reinsurance  davincire and glencoe group returned capital  which included dividends declared and return of capital  net of capital contributions received of million  million and million  respectively  compared with million  nil and a net capital contribution of million  respectively  in we did not participate in davincire s return of capital in our principal us insurance subsidiary stonington is also required to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity 
restrictions with respect to dividends are based on state statutes 
in addition  there are restrictions based on risk based capital tests which is the threshold that constitutes the authorized control level 
if stonington s statutory capital and surplus falls below the authorized control level  the texas department of insurance tdi is authorized to take whatever regulatory actions are considered necessary 
table of contents to protect policyholders and creditors 
at december   the consolidated statutory capital and surplus of stonington was million million 
because of an accumulated deficit in earned surplus from prior operations  stonington cannot currently pay an ordinary dividend without tdi approval 
in the aggregate  our operating subsidiaries have historically produced sufficient cash flows to meet their expected claims payments and operational expenses and to provide dividend payments to us 
our subsidiaries also maintain a concentration of investments in high quality liquid securities  which management believes will provide additional liquidity for extraordinary claims payments should the need arise 
additionally  we maintain a million revolving credit facility to meet additional liquidity and capital requirements 
at december   the million borrowed under this facility  which we used to pay at maturity our senior notes which came due july   remains outstanding 
see capital resources section below 
cash flows and liquidity cash flows from operating activities for were million  which principally consisted of our net income of million prior to dividends on preference shares  a million increase in the minority interest in the undistributed net income of davincire  unrealized losses included in net investment income of million related to our other investments and realized investment losses of million 
our cash flows from operations were primarily used to repurchase our common shares  pay our common and preferred share dividends and pay claims and claim expenses 
we have generated cash flows from operations over the three year period between and significantly in excess of our operating commitments 
because a large portion of the coverages we provide typically can produce losses of high severity and low frequency  it is not possible to accurately predict our future cash flows from operating activities 
as a consequence  our cash flow from operating activities may fluctuate  perhaps significantly  between individual quarters and years 
due to the magnitude and recent occurrence of hurricanes gustav and ike during the third quarter of meaningful uncertainty remains regarding losses from these events and our actual ultimate net losses from these events may vary materially from preliminary estimates 
as a result  our cash flows from operations will be impacted accordingly 
in addition  given the severity of losses incurred in from the large catastrophes  many of which remain unpaid at december   it is likely that we will experience a significant amount of paid claims in which could result in us having reduced or negative cash flows from operations 
reserves for claims and claim expenses we believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves 
claims and claim expense reserves represent estimates  including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell 
we establish our claims and claim expense reserves by taking claims reported to us by insureds and ceding companies  but which have not yet been paid case reserves  adding the costs for additional case reserves additional case reserves which represent our estimates for claims previously reported to us which we believe may not be adequately reserved as of that date  and adding estimates for the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr 

table of contents the following table summarizes our claims and claim expense reserves by line of business and split between case reserves  additional case reserves and ibnr at december  and at december  case reserves additional case reserves ibnr total in thousands property catastrophe reinsurance specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total at december  in thousands property catastrophe reinsurance specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves are not precise in that  among other matters  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends and other variable factors 
some  but not all  of our reserves are further subject to the uncertainty inherent in actuarial methodologies and estimates 
because a reserve estimate is simply an insurer s estimate at a point in time of its ultimate liability  and because there are numerous factors which affect reserves and claims payments but cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our estimates of reserves 
if we determine in a subsequent period that adjustments to our previously established reserves are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the twelve months ended december   and  changes to prior year estimated claims reserves increased our net income by million  million and million  respectively  excluding the consideration of changes in reinstatement premium  profit commissions  davincire minority interest and income tax expense 
our reserving methodology for each line of business uses a loss reserving process that calculates a point estimate for the company s ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims and claim expenses 
we do not calculate a range of estimates 
we use this point estimate  along with paid claims and case reserves  to record our best estimate of additional case reserves and ibnr in our financial statements 
under gaap  we are not permitted to establish estimates for catastrophe claims and claim expense reserves until an event occurs that gives rise to a loss 
reserving for our reinsurance claims involves other uncertainties  such as the dependence on information from ceding companies  which among other matters  includes the time lag inherent in reporting information from the primary insurer to us or to our ceding companies and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
the information received from ceding companies is typically in the form of bordereaux  broker notifications of loss and or discussions with ceding companies or their brokers 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of paid claims and case reserves 
we sometimes also receive an estimate or provision for ibnr 
this information is often updated and adjusted from time to time during the loss settlement period as new data or facts in respect of initial claims  client accounts  industry or event trends may be reported or emerge in addition to changes in applicable statutory and case laws 

table of contents we recorded million of net claims and claim expenses incurred in as a result of losses arising from hurricanes gustav and ike which struck the united states in the third quarter of our estimates of losses from hurricanes gustav and ike are based on factors including currently available information derived from the company s preliminary claims information from certain clients and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models  and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
given the magnitude and recent occurrence of these events  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  several of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates 
in addition  actual losses from these events may increase if our reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations 
our actual losses from these events will likely vary  perhaps materially  from these current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  including the preliminary nature of the available information  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  the effects of any demand surge on claims activity and complex coverage and other legal issues 
included in our results for are million of net claims and claim expenses from kyrill and the uk flood losses which occurred in  as well as million in estimated losses associated with exposure to sub prime related casualty losses 
estimates of these losses are based on a review of potentially exposed contracts  information reported by and discussions with counterparties  and the company s estimate of losses related to those contracts and is subject to change as more information is reported and becomes available 
such information is frequently reported more slowly  and with less initial accuracy  with respect to non us events such as kyrill and the non us floods than with large us catastrophe losses 
in addition  the sub prime related casualty net claims and claim expenses are based on underlying liability contracts which are considered long tail business  and will therefore take many years before the actual losses are known and reported  which increases the uncertainty with respect to the estimate for ultimate losses for this event 
the net claims and claim expenses from kyrill  the uk floods and sub prime related casualty losses are all attributable to the company s reinsurance segment 
during  we incurred significant losses from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
our estimates of these losses are based on factors including currently available information derived from claims information from our clients and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
in particular  due to the size and unusual complexity of certain legal and claims issues  particularly but not exclusively relating to hurricane katrina  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  our loss estimates 
our actual losses from these events will likely vary  perhaps materially  from our current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  and complex coverage and other legal issues 
because of the inherent uncertainties discussed above  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates  and we have generally experienced favorable development on prior year reserves in the last several years 
however  there is no assurance that this will occur in future periods 
our reserving techniques  assumptions and processes differ between our reinsurance and individual risk segments  as well as between our property catastrophe reinsurance and specialty reinsurance businesses within our reinsurance segment 
refer to our claims and claim expense reserves critical accounting estimates discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information on the risks we insure and reinsure  the reserving techniques  assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves  and our current estimates versus our initial estimates of our claims reserves  for each of these units

the repurchase notice was for shares with a gaap book value of million at december  on january   the company on behalf of davincire purchased the shares for million  less a million reserve holdback 
as a result of these purchases  our ownership interest in davincire increased to 
we expect our ownership in davincire to fluctuate over time 
credit ratings our ratings continue to be among the highest in our industry and continue to be supported by our strong financial position 
our ratings are also supported by our prudent erm practices which are rated excellent by s p

concurrently  am best upgraded the fsr to a excellent from a excellent for glencoe  lantana  stonington and stonington lloyds 
additionally  the fsr of davinci was affirmed at a excellent 
the outlook for all our ratings is stable

the outlook on renaissance europe is stable 

table of contents on december   standard poor s raised its ccr on renaissancere a from a 
at the same time  standard poor s raised its ccr and fsr on renaissance reinsurance to aa from a 
in addition  standard poor s raised its ccr on davinci to a from a 
the outlook on all these companies is stable 
while the ratings of renaissance reinsurance are among the highest in our business  adverse ratings actions could have a negative effect on our ability to fully realize current or future market opportunities 
moreover  if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best  standard poor s  moody s or fitch  we believe our competitive position in the insurance industry would suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products 
a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as ceding companies and brokers that place such business move to other reinsurers with higher ratings 
we cannot give any assurance regarding whether or to what extent the rating agencies may downgrade our ratings 
in addition  it is increasingly common for our reinsurance contracts to contain provisions permitting our clients to cancel coverage pro rata if our relevant operating subsidiary is downgraded below a certain rating level 
whether a client would exercise this right would depend  among other factors  on the reason for such a downgrade  the extent of the downgrade  the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage 
therefore  in the event of a downgrade  it is not possible to predict in advance the extent to which this cancellation right would be exercised  if at all  or what effect such cancellations would have on our financial condition or future operations  but such effect potentially could be material 
to date  we are not aware that we have experienced such a cancellation

notwithstanding the foregoing  our investments are subject to market wide risks and fluctuations  as well as to risks inherent in particular securities 

table of contents the large majority of our investments consist of highly rated fixed income securities 
we also have an allocation to other investments  including hedge funds  private equity partnerships  senior secured bank loan funds and other investments

at december   our non investment grade fixed maturity investments available for sale totaled million or of our fixed maturity investments available for sale million or  respectively 
in addition  within our other investments category we have several funds that invest in non investment grade fixed income securities and non investment grade cat linked securities 
at december   the funds that invest in non investment grade fixed income securities and non investment grade cat linked securities totaled million million 
we hold a significant amount of short term investments 
short term investments are managed as part of our investment portfolio and have a maturity of one year or less when purchased 
short term investments are carried at fair value 
as of december   we had  million of short term investments  million 
our target benchmark portfolio for our fixed maturities and short term investments currently has a year duration 
our duration at december  was years years  reflecting our view that the current level of rates affords inadequate compensation for the assumption of additional interest rate risk associated with longer duration 
from time to time  we may reevaluate the duration of our portfolio in light of the duration of our liabilities and market conditions 
as with other fixed income investments  the value of our fixed maturity investments will fluctuate with changes in the interest rate environment and when changes occur in the overall investment market and in overall economic conditions 
additionally  our differing asset classes expose us to other risks which could cause a reduction in the value of our investments 
examples of some of these risks include changes in the overall interest rate environment can expose us to prepayment risk on our mortgage backed investments 
when interest rates decline  consumers will generally make prepayments on their mortgages and  as a result  our investments in mortgage backed securities will be repaid to us more quickly than we might have originally anticipated 
when we receive these prepayments  our opportunities to reinvest these proceeds back into the investment markets will likely be at reduced interest rates 
conversely  when interest rates increase  consumers will generally make fewer prepayments on their mortgages and  as a result  our investments in mortgage backed securities will be repaid to us less quickly than we might have originally anticipated 
this will increase the duration of our portfolio  which is disadvantageous to us in a rising interest rate environment 
our investments in mortgage backed securities are also subject to default risk 
this risk is due in part to defaults on the underlying securitized mortgages  which would decrease the market value of the investment and be disadvantageous to us 
our investments in debt securities of other corporations are exposed to losses from insolvencies of these corporations  and our investment portfolio can also deteriorate based on reduced credit quality of these corporations 
we are also exposed to widening credit spreads even if specific securities are not downgraded 
our investments in asset backed securities are subject to prepayment risks  as noted above  and to the structural risks of these securities 
the structural risks primarily emanate from the priority of each security in the issuer s overall capital structure 
we are also exposed to widening credit spreads 
within our other investments category  we have several funds that invest in non investment grade fixed income securities as well as securities denominated in foreign currencies 
these investments 
table of contents expose us to losses from insolvencies and other credit related issues 
we are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that may result in realized losses to us if our exposures are not hedged or if our hedging strategies are not effective and also to widening of credit spreads

the net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on these investments is included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
net investment income includes interest income together with amortization of market premiums and discounts and is net of investment management and custody fees 
the amortization of premium and accretion of discount for fixed maturity investments is computed using the effective yield method 
the fair values of our fixed maturity investments are based on quoted market prices  or when such prices are not available  by reference to broker or trader bid indications and or internal pricing valuation techniques 
realized gains or losses on the sale of fixed maturity investments are determined using the first in first out cost method and include adjustments to the cost for declines in value that are considered to be other than temporary 
the company routinely assesses whether declines in the fair value of its fixed maturity investments below cost represent impairments that are considered other than temporary 
there are several factors that are considered in the assessment of impairment of a security  which include i the time period during which there has been a significant decline below cost  ii the extent of the decline below cost  iii the company s intent and ability to hold the security  iv the potential for the security to recover in value  v an analysis of the financial condition of the issuer and vi an analysis of the collateral structure and credit support of the security  if applicable 
where the company has determined that there is an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the security  the cost of the security is written down to its fair value and the unrealized loss at the time of the determination is charged to income 

table of contents during  the company recorded million million  million in other than temporary impairment charges 
the other than temporary impairment charges in were primarily due to widening credit spreads during as a result of the turmoil in the financial and capital markets and the other than temporary impairment charges in and were due to rising interest rates 
we recognized impairment charges for principally all of our fixed maturity investments available for sale that were in an unrealized loss position at the end of each quarter for the years ending december   and as we do not currently have the intent to hold them until they fully recover in value 
credit related impairment charges were million  nil  and million in  and  respectively  and relate to impaired securities which the company believes it will not be able to recover the full principal amount if held to maturity

table of contents the fair value of certain of our fund investments  which principally include hedge funds  private equity partnerships  senior secured bank loan funds and non us fixed income funds  is generally established on the basis of the net valuation criteria established by the managers of such investments  if applicable 
these net valuations are determined based upon the valuation criteria established by the governing documents of such investments 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had ready markets existed for the shares  partnership interests or notes 
many of our fund investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales which are determined by the governing documents and limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
in addition  due to a lag in reporting  some of our fund managers  fund administrators  or both  are unable to provide final fund valuations as of our current reporting date 
in these circumstances  we estimate the fair value of these funds by starting with the prior month s or quarter s fund valuation  adjusting these valuations for capital calls  redemptions or distributions and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and then estimating the return for the current period 
in circumstances in which we estimate the return for the current period  we use all credible information available to us 
this principally includes preliminary estimates reported to us by our fund managers  obtaining the valuation of underlying portfolio investments where such underlying investments are publicly traded and therefore have a readily observable price  using information that is available to us with respect to the underlying investments  reviewing various indices for similar investments or asset classes  as well as estimating returns based on the results of similar types of investments for which we have reported results  or other valuation methods  as necessary 
actual final fund valuations may differ from our estimates and these differences are recorded in the period they become known as a change in estimate 
our estimate of the fair value of catastrophe bonds are based on quoted market prices  or when such prices are not available  by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications

table of contents in other ventures  under equity method rather than goodwill and other intangibles on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company s share of the equity in earnings of the tower hill companies is recorded one quarter in arrears 
investments in other ventures  under equity method includes the company s investment in channelre of nil nil 
during  channelre  suffered a significant net loss which reduced channelre s gaap shareholders equity below nil 
the net loss was driven by unrealized mark to market losses related to financial guaranty contracts accounted for as derivatives under gaap 
as a result  the company reduced its carried value in channelre to nil which negatively impacted our net income by million in as a result of reducing the company s carried value in channelre to nil  combined with the fact that the company has no further contractual obligations to provide capital or other support to channelre  the company believes it currently has no further negative economic exposure to channelre 
since channelre remained in a negative shareholders equity position during  the company s investment in channelre continues to be carried at nil 
it is possible that with the adoption of fas by channelre in  that in future periods the nonperformance risk or own credit risk portion of channelre s mark to market on its financial guaranty contracts accounted for as derivatives under gaap may increase  or that the underlying mark to market on channelre s financial guaranty contracts accounted for as derivatives under gaap may decrease  or both  which could result in channelre returning to a positive equity position  at which time the company would then record its share of channelre s net income  subject to impairment  or the company s share of channelre s net loss 
during the fourth quarter of  the company invested million in the preferred equity of aladdin  representing a ownership interest 
due to adverse market conditions  aladdin elected to not write any business and subsequently announced during the fourth quarter of  that it would wind up its operations and return the residual capital to shareholders 
the company expects to receive the majority of its original investment  less administrative expenses incurred

rihl rihl  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  holds investment grade fixed income securities and short term investments and was formed to enhance administrative efficiency and take advantage of the increased benefits and reduced costs ordinarily associated with the management of large investment portfolios of different subsidiaries in the same group

the interest on this facility is based on a spread above libor 
we have reflected the interest due in through based upon the current interest rate on the facility 
the private equity commitments and bank loan fund do not have a defined contractual commitment date and we have therefore included them in the less than one year category 
we caution the reader that the information provided above related to estimated future payment dates of our reserves for claims and claim expenses is not prepared or utilized for internal purposes and that we currently do not estimate the future payment dates of claims and claim expenses 
because of the nature of the coverages that we provide  the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our policy liabilities will fluctuate  perhaps significantly  and therefore are highly uncertain 
we have based our estimates of future claim payments upon benchmark industry payment patterns  drawing upon available relevant sources of loss and allocated loss adjustment expense development data 
these benchmarks are revised periodically as new trends emerge 
we believe that it is likely that this benchmark data will not be predictive of our future claim payments and that material fluctuations can occur due to the nature of the losses which we insure and the coverages which we provide 
in certain circumstances  many of our contractual obligations may be accelerated to dates other than those reflected in the table  due to defaults under the agreements governing those obligations including pursuant to cross default provisions in such agreements or in connection with certain changes in control of the company  if applicable 
in addition  in connection with any such default under the agreement governing these obligations  in certain circumstances  these obligations may bear an increased interest rate or be subject to penalties as a result of such a default 
current outlook general economic conditions the united states and other markets around the world have been experiencing deteriorating economic conditions  including substantial and continuing financial market disruptions 
if this trend in economic conditions continues or deteriorates further through  we believe it would adversely affect the business environment in our principal markets  and accordingly could adversely affect demand for the products sold by us or our clients 
in addition  during an economic downturn  our consolidated credit risk  reflecting our 
table of contents counterparty dealings with agents  brokers  customers  retrocessionaires  capital providers  parties associated with our investment portfolio  and others  would likely be increased 
moreover  our markets may experience increased inflationary conditions which would cause loss costs to increase 
while the company continuously monitors the financial markets for opportunities to raise capital or refinance existing obligations on attractive terms  the company does not currently believe that it requires additional capital in the near term due to its strong current financial position 
however  due to the ever present potential for significant volatility in excess capital due primarily to our exposure to potentially significant catastrophic events and if the current financial market disruption should continue  it could prove difficult to raise capital  when needed  on attractive terms or at all 
for example  as noted under liquidity and capital resources  the company s million revolving credit facility expires in august and while the company may desire to amend this facility or enter into a new facility  we are unable to assure you that we will be able to do so on terms favorable to the company or at all 
current conditions in the investment markets  the current interest rate environment and general economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our net investment income on our fixed income investments and our other invested assets 
in addition to impacting our reported net income  potential future losses on our investment portfolio  including potential future mark to market results  would adversely impact our equity capital 
net investment income is an important contributor to the company s results of operations  and we currently expect the investment environment to remain challenging for the foreseeable future 
we expect the current volatile financial markets and challenging economic conditions to persist for some time and we are unable to predict with certainty when conditions might improve  or the pace or scale of any such improvement 
market conditions and competition the hurricane season proved to be an active year meteorologically  with the occurrence of two significant hurricanes  gustav and ike  as well as a number of smaller storms such as dolly  fay and hanna  making landfall in the united states 
in addition  the dislocations in the investment markets have eroded the capital and surplus of many market participants 
we believe these factors have contributed to changes in market conditions by increasing demand for insurance and reinsurance protection  particularly with respect to the us property catastrophe business  and other risk mitigation products  at a time when the supply of new capacity is constrained 
we currently expect this increased demand to continue through  and to potentially give rise to increased opportunity for new business  although we also expect competition for this business to remain robust 
we are unable to predict how long this situation may persist  although we expect it would be relatively temporary 
while the pricing environment has improved somewhat  particularly in property catastrophe lines  as a result of these and other factors  our markets may also experience increased loss costs  decreased pricing flexibility and potentially reduced consumer purchasing power  which could result in somewhat reduced underwriting profitability for the industry overall 
we believe that our strong relationships  and track record of superior claims paying and other client service  has and will continue to enable us to compete robustly for the business we find attractive 
the market for our catastrophe reinsurance products is generally dynamic and volatile 
the market dynamics noted above  increased or decreased catastrophe loss activity  and changes in the amount of capital in the industry can result in significant changes to the pricing  policy terms and demand for our catastrophe reinsurance contracts over a relatively short period of time 
in addition  changes in state sponsored catastrophe funds such as the fhcf  or the implementation of new government subsidized or sponsored programs  can dramatically alter market conditions 
we believe that the overall trend of increased frequency and severity of catastrophic gulf and atlantic coast storms experienced in recent years may continue for the foreseeable future 
increased understanding of the potential increase in frequency and severity of storms may contribute to increased demand for protection in respect of coastal risks which could impact pricing and terms and conditions in coastal areas over time 
with respect to our individual risk segment  prior to recent developments in the financial markets and in our industry  we had expected to experience increasing competition for attractive new programs  and for the retention of our current programs 
at this time  we believe it is possible that the increased pricing pressures we had been experiencing across many of the lines of individual risk business we write have begun to moderate as a result of the factors noted above  as well as the prospects for increased fragmentation 
table of contents amongst certain competitors and other market participants 
market conditions are fluid and evolving and we cannot assure you that pricing conditions in these markets will improve or that we will succeed in growing our business if they do 
while we are seeing attractive new opportunities in our multi peril crop insurance line of business  which now accounts for almost half of our gross premiums written in our individual risk segment  premiums in this line of business are inherently volatile as they are driven in part by commodity prices  which are subject to significant short and long term price changes 
we plan to continue our disciplined underwriting approach with respect to both the products which we underwrite and the programs as to which we form partnerships 
while we continuously and actively consider new or expanded relationships and seek to respond quickly to potential growth opportunities  our in depth due diligence process means that growth opportunities within this segment take time 
we believe that we have established ourselves as an effective and creative  though disciplined  partner  and as a result we are presented with many of the more attractive opportunities to analyze and compete for 
in addition  we continue to expand the capabilities of our ventures unit to explore potential strategic investments and other opportunities 
in evaluating such new ventures  we seek an attractive return on equity  the ability to develop or capitalize on a competitive advantage  and opportunities that will not detract from our core operations 
we currently expect the ongoing dislocation in the capital and credit markets may present additional  potentially attractive investment and operational opportunities  particularly given our strong reputation  financial resources  and track record of effectively structuring investments and joint ventures 
legislative and regulatory update in january  the state of florida enacted legislation which increased the access of primary florida insurers to the fhcf 
through the fhcf  the state of florida currently provides below market rate reinsurance of up to billion per season  an increase from the previous cap of billion  with the state able to further increase the limits up to an additional billion per season 
further  the legislation expanded the ability of citizens property insurance corporation citizens  a state sponsored entity  to compete with private insurance companies  such as ours 
in  the florida legislature considered but did not pass a bill that would reduce the coverage currently provided by the fhcf 
in addition  the florida legislature did pass legislation the florida bill that  among other things  continued the freeze of citizens rates until at least july  and capped increases for three years thereafter  revised aspects of the size and allocation of assessments and allowed citizens to continue to insure homes worth over million 
in october  the advisory council to the fhcf received a report analyzing the significant challenges the fhcf would face  in part in light of the ongoing global financial market dislocation  if required to fund a significant amount of its total potential financial obligations 
a failure of the fhcf to honor its obligations would adversely impact the florida market  and would pose meaningful challenges to the insurers who have purchased coverage from the fhcf  including many of our clients 
in light of these issues  florida stakeholders and policymakers are considering a number of reform initiatives  including a possible reduction in the current limits offered by the fhcf or possible increases in the premiums charged by the fhcf to citizens and to private insurers 
at this time  we cannot estimate the likelihood that any reforms will be enacted into law  or the impact on existing participants in the florida market  including our clients and investees  on us directly  or on the private florida insurance market generally  if they are not 
in  the us house of representatives passed legislation  us  the flood insurance reform and modernization act  which would renew  expand and alter the national flood insurance program nfip

table of contents also in  the us house of representatives approved another proposed bill  hr  the homeowners defense act of comprised of two titles  one that would create a national catastrophe risk consortium and one that would require the us treasury department to establish a national homeowner s insurance stabilization program

in  congress conducted hearings relating to the tax treatment of offshore insurance and is reported to be considering legislation that would adversely affect reinsurance between affiliates and offshore insurance and reinsurance more generally 
on september   us rep 
richard neal introduced one such proposal  hr the neal bill  a bill which provides that foreign insurers and reinsurers would be capped in deducting reinsurance premiums ceded from us units to offshore affiliates 
the bill  which has been referred to the house ways and means committee  would limit deductions for related party reinsurance cessions to the average percentage of premium ceded to unrelated reinsurers determined in reference to individual business lines 
in the fourth quarter of  the senate finance committee released a staff discussion draft  which was substantively similar to the neal bill 
to date  none of the above legislation has been approved by the senate  although their respective sponsors have announced plans to reintroduce these bills in we can provide no assurance that this legislation or similar legislation will not be adopted 
we believe that passage of such legislation would adversely affect us  perhaps materially 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are principally exposed to five types of market risk interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  equity price risk  credit risk  and energy and weather related risk 
the company s investment guidelines permit  subject to approval  investments in derivative instruments such as futures  options  forward contracts and swap agreements  which may be used to assume risks or for hedging purposes 
interest rate risk our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity investments available for sale and short term investments  whose fair values will fluctuate with changes in interest rates 
we attempt to maintain adequate liquidity in our fixed maturity investments portfolio to fund operations  pay reinsurance and insurance liabilities and claims and provide funding for unexpected events 
we seek to manage our interest rate risk in part by monitoring the duration and structure of our investment portfolio 
the aggregate hypothetical loss generated from an immediate adverse parallel shift in the treasury yield curve of basis points would cause a decrease in market value of  which equated to a decrease in market value of approximately million on a portfolio valued at billion at december  the foregoing reflects the use of an immediate time horizon  since this presents the worst case scenario 
credit spreads are assumed to remain constant in these hypothetical examples 
we use interest rate futures within our portfolio of fixed maturity investments available for sale to manage our exposure to interest rate risk  which can include increasing or decreasing our exposure to this risk 
at december   we had billion of notional long positions and million of notional short positions of eurodollar  us treasury and us dollar futures contracts 
we account for these futures contracts at fair value and record them in our consolidated balance sheet as other assets or other liabilities depending on the rights or obligations 
the fair value of these derivatives as recognized in other assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december   was million million and million million  respectively 
during  we recorded gains of million losses of million in our consolidated statement of operations related to these derivatives 
the fair value of these derivatives is determined using exchange traded closing prices 
the aggregate hypothetical loss generated from an immediate adverse parallel shift in the treasury yield curve of basis points would cause a decrease in market value of our net position in these derivatives of approximately million at december  the foregoing reflects the use of an immediate time horizon  since this presents the worst case scenario 
credit spreads are assumed to remain constant in these hypothetical examples 

table of contents foreign currency risk our functional currency is the us dollar 
we write a portion of our business in currencies other than us dollars and may  from time to time  experience foreign exchange gains and losses and incur underwriting losses in currencies other than us dollars  which will in turn affect our consolidated financial statements 
all changes in exchange rates  with the exception of non us dollar denominated investments classified as available for sale  are recognized currently in our statements of operations 
our foreign currency policy with regard to our underwriting operations is generally to hold foreign currency assets  including cash  investments and receivables that approximate the foreign currency liabilities  including claims and claim expense reserves and reinsurance balances payable 
from time to time  the company will use foreign currency forward and option contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on the value of non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities associated with our underwriting operations 
at december   the company had notional exposure of million million related to foreign currency forward and option contracts purchased 
our foreign currency and option contracts are recorded at fair value  which is determined principally by obtaining quotes from independent dealers and counterparties 
during  we incurred a loss of million gain of million  on our foreign currency forward and option contracts related to our underwriting operations 
for our investment operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations through our investments in non us dollar fixed maturity investments  short term investments and other investments 
at december   our combined investment in these non us dollar investments was million million 
to economically hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations from these investments  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts with net notional exposure of million million 
in the future  we may choose to increase our exposure to non us dollar investments 
unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses arising from non us dollar investments classified as available for sale are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
realized foreign exchange gains or losses from the sale of our non us dollar available for sale investments  realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses from the sale of our non us dollar other investments  and foreign exchange gains losses associated with our hedging of these non us dollar investments are recorded in net foreign exchange gains losses in our statements of operations 
during  we recorded a gain of million loss of million on our foreign currency forward contracts related to hedging our non us dollar investments 
this was offset by a loss of million gain of million on our non us dollar denominated investments 
in addition  we recorded a loss of million in accumulated other comprehensive income million related to the change in unrealized foreign exchange gains losses on non us dollar investments which are classified as available for sale 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk due to our investment in a warrant to purchase common shares of platinum  which we carry on our balance sheet at fair value  as well as to our investments in hedge funds  private equity funds and other investments as described below 
the risk to the platinum warrant is the potential for loss in fair value resulting from adverse changes in the price of platinum s common stock 
the aggregate fair value of this investment in platinum was million at december  a hypothetical percent decline in the price of platinum stock  holding all other factors constant  would have resulted in a million decline in the fair value of the warrant assuming no other changes to the inputs to the black scholes option valuation model that we use 
the decline in the fair value of the warrant would be recorded in other loss 
we are also indirectly exposed to equity market risk through our investments in some hedge funds that have net long equity positions  private equity partnerships whose exit strategies often depend on the equity markets  such investments totaled million at december  million  and our investments in other ventures  under equity method  which totaled million at december  million 
a hypothetical percent decline in the prices of these hedge funds  private equity partnerships and investments in other ventures  under equity method  holding all other factors constant  would have resulted in a million decline in the fair value of these investments at december  
table of contents credit risk our exposure to credit risk is primarily due to our fixed maturity investments available for sale  short term investments  premiums receivable and ceded reinsurance balances 
at december  and  our invested asset portfolio had a dollar weighted average rating of aa 
from time to time  we purchase credit derivatives to hedge our exposures in the insurance industry and to assist in managing the credit risk associated with ceded reinsurance 
at december   the maximum payments we were obligated to make under credit default swaps was million million 
the fair value of these credit derivatives  as recognized in other liabilities in our balance sheet at december   was million million 
during  we recorded gains of million million in our consolidated statement of operations 
we account for credit derivatives at fair value and record them on our consolidated balance sheet as other assets or other liabilities depending on the rights or obligations 
the fair value of the credit derivatives are determined using industry valuation models 
the fair value of these credit derivatives can change based on a variety of factors including changes in credit spreads  default rates and recovery rates  the correlation of credit risk between the referenced credit and the counterparty  and market rate inputs such as interest rates 
we are exposed to credit risk through our equity investment in channelre  a privately held financial guaranty reinsurance company 
our investment in channelre is subject to potentially significant variability  resulting from mark to market changes  due to changes in credit market conditions 
while the company has no further negative economic exposure to channelre  it is possible that the mark to market will fluctuate  perhaps increasing or decreasing over time  and it is possible that as the underlying securities near maturity  if there are no defaults on the underlying securities for which channelre is obligated  the mark to market adjustment could reverse  perhaps materially 
energy and weather related derivative risk we purchase and sell certain derivative financial products primarily to address weather risks and engage in hedging and trading activities related to these risks 
the trading markets for the instruments in which we participate are generally linked to weather  other natural phenomena  or products or indices linked in part to such phenomena  such as heating and cooling degree days  precipitation  energy production and prices  and commodity prices 
the fair value of these contracts is obtained through the use of quoted market prices  or in the absence of such quoted prices  industry or internal valuation models 
these contracts are recorded on our balance sheet at december   in other assets and other liabilities and totaled million and million  respectively million and million  respectively 
during  the company generated income related to these derivatives of million incurred losses of million which are included in other income loss and represents net settlements and changes in the fair value of these contracts 
in addition  we have entered into a credit derivatives agreement with respect to cat linked securities whereby we have sold cat linked securities with a par amount of million at december  million to a bank  while retaining the underlying risk 
the agreement allows us to repurchase these securities at par and obligates us to repurchase the securities under certain circumstances including catastrophe triggering events and events of default 
as a result of this transaction  we are receiving the spread over libor for each of the cat link securities subject to the credit derivatives agreement  less a financing fee 
the credit derivatives agreement is accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in other loss 
we recognized million million of other income in our consolidated statements of operations in from this transaction 
a change decrease in the value of securities underlying the credit derivatives agreement would negatively impact our results by million
