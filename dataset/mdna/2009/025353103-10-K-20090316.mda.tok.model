services provided by specialists who are board certified or board eligible 
accredited by the accreditation association for ambulatory health care aaahc 
texas oral maxillofacial surgery associates merged with carus dental in university dental associates dental residency program is accredited by the american dental association 
operations operating structure where permitted by applicable state law  we generally employ the hygienists  dental assistants and administrative staff at each dental facility  but all clinical activities are performed under the supervision of the dentists who are employed by or contracted with an affiliated practice 
each dental facility has a manager who  along with the administrative staff  typically oversees the day to day business operations  including facility staffing  patient scheduling  on site patient billing and ordering office and dental supplies 
each affiliated dental group has a local operations director who oversees all the managers of the dental facilities of a particular affiliated dental group 

table of contents our shared services teams provide administrative and operational support to one or more affiliated dental groups on either a national  regional or local basis 
these teams provide or assist in organizational planning and development  recruiting  hiring and training programs  administering employee benefits and processing payroll  developing and maintaining information systems  developing annual operating plans  producing accounting and financial reporting information  developing and maintaining facilities  and marketing 
as smaller affiliated dental groups grow in size  they may add local resources to assume some of the support functions provided by shared services teams 
a regional operations director is responsible for monitoring the operating performance of multiple affiliated dental groups in multiple communities 
each regional operations director participates as a member of the joint policy board of each of the affiliated dental groups for which he or she has oversight responsibilities 
the regional operations directors are responsible for overseeing the development of annual operating plans and monitoring actual results 
accreditation association for ambulatory health care we have selected the accreditation association for ambulatory health care aaahc as a means for supporting the quality initiatives of the affiliated dental groups 
the aaahc is a peer based  not for profit organization that is nationally recognized for conducting extensive evaluations of ambulatory health care organizations 
the aaahc evaluates a number of areas in granting accreditation  such as patients rights  governance  administration  clinical records  professional development  quality management and improvement and facilities 
we work with the affiliated practices to achieve accreditation 
depending on the level of development and organization  achieving accreditation can take several years of preparation 
currently  ten affiliated practices have achieved accreditation status from the aaahc 
training and leadership development we believe that our long term success requires a significant investment in the development of people at all levels within the company and at the affiliated practices 
we have both leadership development and skills training programs 
the american dental partners leadership institute provides both personal and professional development by bringing dentists and management leaders together to develop effective leadership techniques to create work environments that inspire peak performance from team members 
the leadership institute is conducted on a national basis with dentists and management from multiple affiliated dental groups in attendance 
as part of the learning process  participants receive feedback on the climate they create  their leadership styles and their leadership competencies 
feedback is obtained from the leader s team members through on line assessment surveys 
survey results are shared with the leader during the program  and personal action plans are created to enhance leadership effectiveness 
we believe creating a high performance climate improves morale  lowers staff turnover and improves productivity 
we have also devoted significant resources to develop innovative  proprietary skills training programs 
training programs exist for improving patient service  such as creating a positive patient arrival departure experience  improving telephone etiquette and managing unhappy patients  and developing business management competencies  such as improving recruiting skills  developing effective mentoring processes and managing time 
the programs are modular and are made available at the affiliated dental groups 
we have a national training team comprised of training specialists who partner with the leadership of our affiliated groups to assess the job skills and services of each affiliate in order to implement and maintain continuous training and development programs 
once implemented  the affiliated dental groups have on going sessions with additional modules as they are developed and with new staff members as they join the dental group 
we believe that by investing in skills training  we empower our team members to assist the affiliated practices in providing exceptional patient care and service 

table of contents payor relationships and reimbursement mix although we believe that the clinical philosophy of each affiliated practice should not be compromised by economic decisions  we recognize that the source of payment for dental services affects operating and financial performance 
generally  we believe it is easier to grow patient revenue within a given community when the payor mix of the affiliated practice is aligned with the payor mix in that community 
we help the affiliated practices optimize their revenue by analyzing their payor mix on an ongoing basis  as well as providing assistance with evaluating and negotiating their dental benefit provider contracts for improved reimbursement rates 
we believe it is advantageous to be affiliated with dental group practices that have successfully provided care to patients under all reimbursement methodologies 
since a shift is taking place in the dental benefits market from indemnity insurance plans and capitated managed care plans to ppo plans and dental referral plans  we believe that experience in operating under all of these plans provides an advantage as it relates to increasing community presence 
most of the affiliated practices provide care under traditional fee for service plans and non fee for service plans 
the following table provides the aggregate payor mix of the affiliated practices for the years ended december fee for service ppo and dental referral plans capitated managed care plans in recent years  many of the affiliated practices have been realigning their reimbursement mix away from deeply discounted dental benefit plans or negotiating improved reimbursement rates 
this effort has largely been accomplished with the cooperation of the dental benefit provider community in general 
there can be no assurance  however  that this effort will not result in the termination of certain third party payor contracts between the affiliated practices and dental benefit providers that adversely impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
facilities development and management the affiliated practices operate out of dental facilities that in most instances we lease from third parties under long term operating leases 
generally  our dental facilities are constructed to be warm  attractive and inviting to patients and typically have between eight and ten operatories or treatment rooms  which accommodate general and specialty dentists  hygienists and dental assistants as well as required support staff 
most of the dental facilities are either located within a professional office or medical building or are a free standing location 
we assist the affiliated dental groups in improving facility utilization by evaluating existing capacity  identifying expansion opportunities and prioritizing facility upgrades 
we acquire or construct each dental facility as appropriate for the local community and add or equip additional operatories to meet increases in demand 
we use architectural design services to improve facility design by working with each affiliated dental group to establish defined facility standards 
these standards are developed to meet the needs of each affiliated dental group  while creating a consistency across new dental facilities which shortens the site development process and improves productivity of dentists and support staff 
financial planning and financial information system we assist the affiliated dental groups with financial planning 
in conjunction with each affiliated practice  we develop an annual operating plan for the affiliated dental group which sets specific goals for revenue growth  operating expenses and capital expenditures 
once a plan has been approved by the joint policy board  we measure forecasted and actual financial performance of each affiliated dental group against the annual operating plan 
our financial information system enables us to measure  monitor and compare the financial performance of each affiliated dental group on a standardized basis 
the system also allows us to track and control costs and facilitates the accounting and financial reporting process 
this financial system is used with all affiliated dental groups 

table of contents practice management systems the affiliated dental groups use various dental practice management software systems to facilitate patient scheduling  billing patients and insurance companies  assistance with facility staffing and for other practice related activities 
since  we have been developing improvis  a proprietary practice management system which replaces comdent  a legacy software system 
improvis has been designed to include expanded clinical  managerial and financial capabilities 
as of december   affiliated dental groups had implemented improvis at dental facilities 
we intend to implement improvis at four additional affiliated dental groups in at year end  we were pilot testing improvis electronic dental record phase  and in we intend to pilot test improvis digital radiography phase 
in addition to these phases  improvis will include orthodontic practice management and management dashboard functionality as future phases 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will successfully implement improvis at additional dental groups during or that all phases of the system will be successfully developed 
in connection with one of our affiliations  we acquired the rights to comdent  a practice management system designed for use by multi specialty dental groups 
comdent has been in continuous use since  and as of december   comdent was in use at two of the affiliated dental groups 
we intend to retire comdent in two of the affiliated dental groups use commercially available practice management systems 
orthodontic care specialists and deerwood orthodontics  which exclusively provide orthodontic services  utilize a proprietary practice management system designed specifically for the unique requirements of the orthodontics specialty 
we have implemented this orthodontic practice management system at fifteen other affiliated dental groups which have a significant orthodontics practice 
service agreements and affiliation structure except for arizona s tooth doctor for kids see arizona s tooth doctor for kids  we have entered into a service agreement with each affiliated practice pursuant to which we are responsible for managing all administrative  non clinical aspects of the dental practice 
we anticipate that each new dental practice with which we affiliate will enter into a similar service agreement or become a party to an existing service agreement at the time of affiliation with us 
we are dependent on our service agreements for the vast majority of our net revenue 
the termination of one or more of our service agreements could have a material adverse effect on us 
pursuant to the service agreement  the affiliated practice is solely responsible for all clinical aspects of the dental operations of the affiliated dental group 
these clinical aspects include recruiting and hiring dentists  selecting  training and supervising other licensed dental personnel and unlicensed dental assistants  providing dental care  implementing and maintaining quality assurance and peer review programs  setting patient fee schedules  entering into dental benefit plan provider contracts and maintaining professional and comprehensive general liability insurance covering the affiliated practice and each of its dentists 
we do not assume any authority  responsibility  supervision or control over the provision of dental care to patients 
the service agreement also includes non competition and confidentiality provisions which prohibit the affiliated practice from owning or operating another dental facility or having any interest in any business which competes with us  within the contractually agreed upon service territory 
pursuant to the service agreement  we are responsible for providing dental facilities  support staff and all services necessary and appropriate for the administration of the non clinical aspects of the affiliated dental group 
these services include assisting with organizational planning and development  providing recruiting  retention and training programs  supporting quality assurance initiatives  providing on going facilities development and maintenance  administering employee benefits and payroll  procuring supplies and other necessary resources  maintaining necessary information systems  assisting with marketing and payor relations  and providing financial planning  reporting and analysis 
as mandated by the service agreement  we along with each affiliated practice establish a joint policy board which is responsible for developing and implementing management and administrative policies 
the joint policy board consists of an equal number of representatives designated by us and the affiliated practice 
the joint policy board members designated by the affiliated practice must be licensed 
table of contents dentists currently employed by the practice 
the joint policy board s responsibilities include the review and approval of the long term strategic and short term operational goals  objectives and plans for the dental facilities  all annual capital and operating plans  all renovation and expansion plans and capital equipment expenditures with respect to the dental facilities  all advertising and marketing services and staffing plans regarding provider and support personnel 
the joint policy board also reviews and monitors the financial performance of the affiliated dental group  including the affiliated practice 
the joint policy board also has the authority to approve or disapprove any merger or combination with  or acquisition of  any dental practice by the affiliated practice 
finally  the joint policy board reviews and makes recommendations with respect to contractual relationships with dental benefit providers  as well as patient fee schedules  although these and all other clinical decisions  as enumerated above  remain the exclusive decision of the affiliated practice through its joint policy board members 
the affiliated practices reimburse us for actual expenses incurred on their behalf in connection with the operation and administration of the dental facilities and pay fees to us for management services provided and capital committed 
under certain service agreements  our service fee consists entirely of a fixed monthly fee determined by agreement between us and the affiliated practice in a formal annual planning process 
under certain service agreements  our service fee consists of a monthly fee equal to the prior year service fee and an additional performance fee based upon a percentage of the increase of the amount by which the affiliated practice s patient revenue exceeds expenses as compared to the prior year 
in no event  however  under these service agreements will the total service fee be greater than the affiliated practice s patient revenue less expenses 
under certain service agreements  our service fee consists of a monthly fee which is based upon a specified percentage of the amount by which the affiliated practice s patient revenue exceeds expenses 
under a certain service agreement our service fee consists of a fixed monthly fee and an additional performance fee based upon a percentage of the amount by which the affiliated practice s patient revenue exceeds expenses as compared to the planned amount of the current year 
the structure of the service fee  whether comprised of variable  fixed and variable or fixed components  is dependent in part on laws of each state in which we operate 
the affiliated practice is also responsible for provider expenses  which generally consist of the salaries  benefits and certain other expenses of the dentists 
pursuant to the terms of the service agreements  we bill patients and third party payors on behalf of the affiliated practices 
such funds  as collected  are applied in the following order of priority reimbursement of expenses incurred by us in connection with the operation and administration of the dental facilities  repayment of advances  if any  made by us to the affiliated practice  payment of monthly service fee to us  payment of provider expenses  and payment of the additional variable service fee  if applicable  to us 
our service agreements have an initial term of years and automatically renew for successive five year terms  unless terminated by notice given at least days prior to the end of the initial term or any renewal term 
in addition  the service agreement may be terminated earlier by either party upon the occurrence of certain events involving the other party  such as dissolution  bankruptcy  liquidation or our failure  which continues through the applicable notice and cure period  to perform material duties and obligations under the service agreement 
in the event a service agreement is terminated  the affiliated practice is required to reimburse us for unpaid expenses incurred in connection with the operation and administration of the dental facilities  repay advances and pay us for unpaid service fees 
in addition  the affiliated practice may be required  at our option in nearly all instances  to purchase the unamortized balance of intangible assets at the current book value  repurchase equipment and other assets at the greater of fair value or book value and assume our leases and other liabilities related to the terminated service agreement 
as part of the litigation settlement with pdg  we entered into a transition services agreement effective january  under the agreement  we provided certain of the same types of services to pdg as we provide under our 
table of contents other service agreements  including access to our comdent practice management system  financial reporting and accounting  billing and collection management  human resource  accounts payable and payroll  supplies procurement and other administrative services 
these services were provided to the dental facilities transferred to pdg as part of the litigation settlement and to the pdg dentists who were practicing in our dental facilities on a temporary basis 
our services under the agreement terminated on september   pdg has paid fees for the services in the aggregate amount of  in and reimbursed certain of our expenses

arizona s tooth doctor for kids we own of arizona s tooth doctor for kids tooth doctor 
tooth doctor is a dental group practice which provides dental care to children through six locations in metropolitan phoenix and globe  arizona  and approximately of the group s revenue is derived from ppo health plans that are contracted with the arizona health care cost containment system ahcccs  the state s medicaid program 
while we employ the tooth doctor dentists as permitted by applicable state law  we do not exercise control over  or otherwise influence  their clinical judgment  decisions or practice 
competition the dental services industry is highly competitive 
there are approximately competing dental management companies in our current service areas that provide business services to dentists and dental group practices through contractual arrangements 
the principal factors of competition between dental management companies are their affiliation models  the number and reputation of their existing affiliated practices  their management expertise  the quality of support services provided to the affiliated practices and their financial track record 
we believe we compete effectively with other companies that provide business services to dental practices with respect to these factors 
the dental practices affiliated with us compete with other dental group practices and individual dentists in their respective communities 
government regulation general the practice of dentistry is highly regulated  and our operations and those of the affiliated practices are subject to numerous state and federal laws and regulations 
furthermore  we may become subject to additional laws and regulations as we expand into new states  and there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we and the affiliated practices operate will not change significantly in the future 
our ability to operate profitably will depend  in part  upon us and the affiliated practices obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses  certifications and other approvals and operating in compliance with applicable laws 
future legislative or regulatory changes could have a material impact on us  and violations of federal or state laws can result in criminal  civil and administrative penalties 
we structure our business  operations and contractual relationships in a manner intended to comply with applicable law  but there can be no assurance that applicable laws will not change and will be interpreted in a manner consistent with our interpretation and intent 
in light of this  our service agreements provide that if there is any change in any law  regulation  rule or policy  or any ruling or interpretation by any court or other governing body  that materially and adversely affects  or is reasonably likely to affect  the way in which either party is to perform or be compensated under the service agreement  or which makes the service agreement unlawful  then the parties are obligated to use their best efforts to revise their relationship in a way that complies with the applicable regulatory change or ruling and approximates as closely as possible the economic positions of the parties prior to that change or ruling 
there can be no assurance  however  that this provision will be enforced if the legality of our service agreement is challenged 

table of contents state regulation each state imposes licensing and other requirements on dentists 
the laws of almost all states in which we currently operate prohibit  either by specific statutes  case law or as a matter of general public policy  entities not wholly owned or controlled by dentists  such as american dental partners  from practicing dentistry  employing dentists and  in certain circumstances  dental assistants and hygienists  exercising control over the provision of dental services  splitting fees or receiving fees for patient referrals 
many states prohibit or restrict the ability of a person other than a licensed dentist to own  manage or control the assets  equipment or facilities used by a dental practice 
however  the laws of arizona permit us to own the dental practice and employ the dentists at tooth doctor 
the laws of some states prohibit the advertising of dental services under a trade or corporate name and require all advertisements to be in the name of a dentist 
a number of states also regulate the content of advertisements of dental services and the use of promotional gift items 
these laws and their interpretation vary from state to state and are enforced by regulatory authorities with broad discretion 
many states laws and regulations relating to the practice of dentistry were adopted prior to the emergence of providers of business services to dental group practices like us 
as a result  a number of states  including states in which we currently operate  are in the process of reviewing and or amending their laws or regulations relating to the practice of dentistry and dentists business arrangements with unlicensed persons like us 
there can be no assurance that any amendments or new laws or regulations  or the interpretation or application of existing or new laws or regulations  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there are certain regulatory issues associated with our role in negotiating and administering managed care contracts 
to the extent that we or any affiliated practice contracts with third party payors  including self insured plans  under a capitated or other arrangement which causes us or such affiliated practice to assume a portion of the financial risk of providing dental care  we or such affiliated practice may become subject to state insurance laws 
if we or any affiliated practice is determined to be engaged in the business of insurance  we may be required to change our contractual relationships or seek appropriate licensure 
any regulation of us or the affiliated practices under insurance laws could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in certain circumstances  through our role in negotiating and administering managed care and other provider contracts  plans or arrangements we are also subject to regulation in certain states as an administrator and must ensure that our activities comply with relevant regulation 
federal regulation the dental industry is also regulated at the federal level to the extent that dental services are reimbursed under federal programs 
participation by the affiliated practices and their dentists in such programs subjects them  and potentially us  to significant regulation regarding the provision of services to beneficiaries  submission of claims and related matters  including the types of regulations discussed below 
violation of these laws or regulations can result in civil and criminal penalties  including possible exclusion of individuals and entities from participation in federal payment programs 
the federal anti kickback statutes prohibit  in part  and subject to certain safe harbors  the payment or receipt of remuneration in return for  or in order to induce  referrals  or arranging for referrals  for items or services which are reimbursable under federal payment programs 
other federal laws impose significant penalties for false or improper billings or inappropriate coding for dental services 
the federal self referral law  or stark law  prohibits dentists from making referrals for certain designated health services reimbursable under federal payment programs to entities with which they have financial relationships unless a specific exception applies 
the stark law also prohibits the entity receiving such referrals from submitting a claim for services provided pursuant to such referral 
we may be subject to federal payor rules prohibiting the assignment of the right to receive payment for services rendered unless certain conditions are met 
these rules prohibit a billing agent from receiving a fee based on a percentage of collections and may require payments for the services of the dentists to 
table of contents be made directly to the dentist providing the services or to a lock box account held in the name of the dentist or his or her dental group 
in addition  these rules provide that accounts receivables from federal payors are not saleable or assignable 
tooth doctor and the other affiliated practices are also covered entities under the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa 
among other things  hipaa includes provisions regarding protection of the privacy of patient identifiable health information  requiring us to maintain extensive policies and procedures and also includes provisions relating to standards for security of electronic protected health information and electronic transactions 
new health information standards  whether implemented pursuant to hipaa or otherwise  could have a material effect on how we and our affiliated practices handle health care related data and the cost of compliance 
failure to comply with existing or new laws or regulations related to patient health information could result in criminal or civil sanctions finally  dental practices are also subject to compliance with federal regulatory standards in the areas of safety  health and access 
medicaid tooth doctor and three of our other affiliated practices are providers under medicaid programs in arizona  minnesota  new york and texas 
as a result  they must comply with both state and federal medicaid laws as well as the requirements of their contracts with third party payors which administer claims and reimbursement under those programs 
insurance we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is appropriate for our business  including property  business interruption and general liability  among others 
in addition  the affiliated practices are required to maintain  or cause to be maintained  professional liability insurance with us as a named insured 
certain of our insurances are reinsured by a wholly owned captive insurance company licensed in the state of vermont 
while we believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate for our current operations  it may not be sufficient for all future claims 
in addition  the costs  retention levels and availability of certain insurance have fluctuated significantly in recent years  and there can be no assurance that our current insurance coverages will continue to be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost in the future or that reserve levels of our captive insurance company for potential losses below applicable retention levels under certain insurance coverages will be sufficient

risk factors we may not be able to refinance our credit facilities on satisfactory terms our revolving credit facility and term loan mature on january  and the current credit markets are very limited and restrictive 
our failure to extend the maturity or to refinance our revolving credit facility and term loan with our existing lenders or others on satisfactory terms will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be able to refinance only a portion of our revolving credit facility and term loan  necessitating the issuance of subordinated debt  preferred stock or common stock  or some combination of such securities 
such securities may include interest or dividends  voting rights or other dilutive effects to our existing shareholders 
we are impacted by general economic conditions our net revenue depends primarily on revenue generated by the affiliated practices 
we estimate approximately of the patients of our affiliated practices have dental insurance  and demand for dental care is heavily influenced by dental insurance 
in general  dental insurance covers of preventative care  only of basic restorative procedures and of more extensive restorative procedures 
in addition  dental insurance often caps 
table of contents benefits at an annual maximum of  to  as a result  patients  with or without dental insurance  are financially responsible for a considerable portion of their dental expenditures 
with the deteriorating economic conditions initially emanating from consumer indebtedness  consumer spending patterns have changed 
our affiliated practices have observed patients either delaying care or  for those patients with dental insurance  opting for dental procedures that are largely covered by insurance 
as are result  revenue growth rates of the affiliated practices have decreased and revenue mix has shifted towards lower cost and lower profitability dental procedures 
the effect to us is lower net revenue and lower profit margins 
we believe economic conditions will adversely impact us during  although we are unable to predict the likely duration or severity of the current adverse economic conditions or the severity of the effect of those conditions on our business and results of operations 
we also believe the current economic conditions will not lessen the dental care needs of patients and therefore will not impact long term trends of the dental care industry 
we are dependent on the performance of the affiliated practices for our net revenue our net revenue depends primarily on revenue generated by the affiliated practices 
we do not employ dentists  except for arizona s tooth doctor for kids  and we do not control the clinical decisions of any of the affiliated practices 
there can be no assurance that the affiliated practices will maintain successful operations or that any of the key members of a particular affiliated practice will continue practicing with that practice 
availability of dentists  hygienists or dental assistants could have a material adverse effect on our business 
to the extent permitted by state law  each affiliated practice has entered into non competition agreements and other restrictive covenants with dentists under their employ and we have similar restrictive covenants with tooth doctor s dentists 
there can be no assurance that these restrictive covenants will remain in effect in all cases  are or will be sufficient to protect the interests of the affiliated practices or that a court will enforce such agreements 
any material loss of revenue by an affiliated practice  whether due to the loss of existing dentists or the inability to recruit new ones  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent upon the service agreements we have entered into with each of the affiliated practices  except for tooth doctor  for substantially all of our revenue 
revenue generated from our service agreements with metro dentalcare plc  the affiliated dental practice at metro dentalcare  and with wisconsin dental group  sc  the affiliated practice at forward dental  represented and  respectively of our consolidated net revenue in the termination of either of these service agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our net revenue may be adversely affected by third party payor cost containment efforts a significant portion of the payments for dental care that is received by the affiliated practices is paid or reimbursed under insurance programs with third party payors 
third party payors are continually negotiating the fees charged for dental care  with a goal of containing reimbursement and utilization rates 
loss of revenue by the affiliated practices caused by third party payor cost containment efforts or an inability to negotiate satisfactory reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some third party payor contracts are capitated arrangements 
under such contracts  the affiliated practice receives a monthly payment based on the number of members for which they provide care and generally receives a co payment from the patient at the time care is provided 
such payment methods shift a portion of the risk of providing care from the third party payors to the affiliated practice 
to the extent that patients covered by such contracts require more frequent or extensive care than is anticipated  there may be a shortfall between the capitated payments received by the affiliated practice and the costs incurred to provide such care 
unfavorable utilization under these contracts  as well as termination of such contracts  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our net revenue at tooth doctor and three other affiliated practices may be adversely affected by changes in state medicaid programs tooth doctor is largely dependent upon reimbursements under arizona s medicaid program and three of our other affiliated practices are providers under various state medicaid programs 
changes in those programs affecting provider eligibility  reimbursement rates or specific dental procedures eligible for reimbursement  or our affiliated practices failure to maintain its authorization as a provider under these programs  or to comply with applicable state and federal law or its contracts with the payors who administer claims and make payments under these programs  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
determinations by regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our operations the dental industry and dental practices are highly regulated at the state and federal levels  as described in item business government regulation 
many of these laws and regulations vary widely by state 
in addition  these laws and regulations are enforced by federal and state regulatory authorities with broad discretion  and our agreements may be subject to review by these authorities from time to time 
for example  regulatory authorities in some states in which we operate have obtained a copy of our service agreement for review in the past  and in the future such reviews could result in changes to our service agreements 
we do not  and do not intend to  control the practice of dentistry by the affiliated practices or their compliance with the regulatory requirements directly applicable to dentists or the practice of dentistry 
however  there can be no assurance that any review of our business relationships  including our relationship with the affiliated practices  by courts or other regulatory authorities  will not result in determinations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
changes in the laws and regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our operations similarly  there can be no assurance that the laws and regulatory environment will not change to restrict or limit the enforceability of our service agreements 
the laws and regulations of some states in which we currently operate or may seek to expand may require us to change our contractual relationships with dental group practices in a manner that may restrict our operations in those states or may prevent us from affiliating with dental group practices or providing comprehensive business services to dental group practices in those states  or may require us to restructure our current or future operations 
for example  a bill recently introduced in the arizona legislature would impose additional specific reporting and other obligations on business entities  such as us  who own dental practices  and there have been efforts in the past to enact legislation which would have restricted our ability to own dental practices in that state 
there can be no assurance that similar legislation will not be enacted in the future 
additionally  the arizona board of dentistry has approved changes to certain sedation rules  and those proposed changes were sent to the governor s regulatory review counsel for review 
those changes  if ultimately implemented  or other changes to these rules could adversely affect tooth doctor 
our future affiliations or acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms or successfully integrated our strategy includes expansion through affiliations with dental group practices in new and existing states and the expansion of such affiliated practices 
affiliations involve numerous risks  including failure to retain key personnel and contracts of the affiliated practices and the inability to work successfully with us as a business partner 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete additional affiliations on acceptable terms and conditions or that we will be able to serve successfully as a business partner to additional practices  and this could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  we entered into agreements to amend our revolving credit agreement and our term loan effective october  which limit amounts which can be borrowed to fund affiliations and acquisitions  and as a result the number of new affiliations and acquisitions over the next twelve months will be at levels lower than we achieved in recent years 
we may not realize the expected value of our goodwill and intangible assets a significant portion of our total assets is represented by goodwill and intangible assets  with the amount expected to increase with future affiliations 
in addition  the amortization expense related to definite lived 
table of contents intangible assets will increase in the future as a result of additional intangible assets recorded in connection with new affiliations 
management performs an impairment test on goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually or when facts and circumstances exist which would suggest that the goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
an impairment test on goodwill and definite lived intangible assets is performed when facts and circumstances exist which would suggest that the definite lived intangible asset may be impaired  such as loss of key personnel  change in legal factors or competition 
impairment assessment inherently involves judgment as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
if impairment were determined  we would make the appropriate adjustment to the intangible asset to reduce the asset s carrying value to fair value 
in the event of any sale or liquidation of us or a portion of our assets  there can be no assurance that the value of our intangible assets will be realized 
any future determination requiring the write off of goodwill  indefinite lived intangibles or a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results may be adversely affected by professional liability claims against the affiliated practices the affiliated practices and or individual dentists in their employ could be exposed to the risk of professional liability claims  and it is possible that such claims could also be asserted against us 
with respect to tooth doctor  any such claims would likely be asserted against us 
such claims  if successful  could result in substantial damages that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage 
we are named as an insured under the professional liability insurance policy covering the affiliated practices 
in addition  we also require each affiliated practice to indemnify us for actions or omissions related to the delivery of dental care by such affiliated practice 
however  a successful professional liability claim against an affiliated practice or us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business our continued success depends upon the retention of our senior officers who have been instrumental in our success and upon our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals 
the loss of some of our senior officers  or an inability to attract or retain other key individuals  could materially adversely affect us 
continued growth and success in our business depends  to a large degree  on our ability to retain and attract such employees

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview american dental partners is a leading provider of dental facilities  support staff and business services to multidisciplinary dental group practices in selected markets throughout the united states 
we are committed to the success of the affiliated practices  and we make substantial investments to support each affiliated practice s growth 
we provide or assist with organizational planning and development  recruiting  retention and training programs  quality assurance initiatives  facilities development and management  employee benefits administration  procurement  information systems and practice technology  marketing and payor relations  and financial planning  reporting and analysis 
at december  we were affiliated with dental group practices  comprising full time equivalent dentists practicing in dental facilities in states 
our net revenue depends primarily on revenue generated by the affiliated practices 
we estimate approximately of the patients of our affiliated practices have dental insurance  and demand for dental care is heavily influenced by dental insurance 
in general  dental insurance covers of preventative care  only of basic restorative procedures and of more extensive restorative procedures 
in addition  dental insurance often caps benefits at an annual maximum of  to  as a result  patients  with or without dental insurance  are financially responsible for a considerable portion of their dental expenditures 
with the deteriorating economic conditions initially emanating from consumer indebtedness  consumer spending patterns have changed 
our affiliated practices have observed patients either delaying care or  for those patients with dental insurance  opting for dental procedures that are largely covered by insurance 
as are result  revenue growth rates of the affiliated practices have decreased and revenue mix has shifted towards lower cost and lower profitability dental procedures 
the effect to us is lower net revenue and lower profit margins 
we believe economic conditions will adversely impact us during  although we are unable to predict the likely duration or severity of the current adverse economic conditions or the severity of the effect of those conditions on our business and results of operations 
acquisition and affiliation summary when affiliating with a dental practice  we customarily acquire selected assets and enter into a long term service agreement with the affiliated practice 
under our service agreements  we are responsible for providing all services necessary for the administration of the non clinical aspects of the dental operations 
the affiliated practice is responsible for the provision of dental care 
each of our service agreements is for an initial term of years 
during  and  we completed eight  and acquisition and affiliation transactions  respectively 
in four of these transactions  we acquired non clinical assets and entered into long term service agreements with the affiliated practices 
in one of these transactions  we developed de novo dental facilities rather than acquiring non clinical assets  and we entered into a long term service agreement with the affiliated practice 
in of these transactions  we acquired non clinical assets  and the practices were combined with one of our existing affiliated practices and became subject to an existing service agreement 
in one of these transactions  we acquired the assets of the practice  arizona s tooth doctor for kids tooth doctor  and as permitted by applicable state law  tooth doctor employs the dentists thus not necessitating a service agreement between us and the affiliated practice 
finally  in one of these transactions  we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of metro dentalcare which owned non clinical assets  and entered into a long term service agreement with an affiliated practice  metro dentalcare  plc these acquisition and affiliation transactions resulted in the addition of seven affiliated practices  dental facilities and operatories 
the  and acquisition and affiliation transactions  at the time of the transactions  generated million  million and million of patient revenue on an annualized basis  respectively 
we are constantly evaluating potential acquisition and affiliation transactions with dental practices and acquisitions of other dental related companies that would expand our business capabilities 
we entered into 
table of contents agreements to amend our revolving credit agreement and our term loan effective october  which limit amounts which can be borrowed to fund affiliations and acquisitions  and as a result the number of new affiliations and acquisitions over the next twelve months will be at levels lower than we achieved in recent years 
litigation settlement agreements in december  we entered into a settlement agreement in which the service agreement with pdg  pa was terminated effective december   and we transferred the operating assets of of the park dental facilities and the park dental trade name to pdg 
we retained the remaining six dental facilities which were combined with metro dentalcare 
we also entered into a transition services agreement with pdg to provide services for a period of nine months through september  for  we completed the transition services  received the related million payment and are completing the final steps in the separation of the companies 
as a result of these agreements  our results of operations are not comparable and may not reflect the results of operations to be expected in future periods 
revenue overview net revenue our net revenue includes management fees earned by us pursuant to the terms of the service agreements with the affiliated practices  as well as reimbursement of clinic expenses paid by us on their behalf  and other revenue which includes patient revenue of tooth doctor  fees earned by our dental benefits third party administrator tpa  fees earned by our dental laboratory and other miscellaneous revenue 
in  other revenue also includes fees earned under the transition services agreement with pdg 
the following table provides the components of our net revenue for  and in thousands reimbursement of expenses business service fees revenue earned under service agreements other revenue net revenue includes  earned from the transition services agreement with pdg see litigation settlement agreements 
revenues earned from business service fees and reimbursed expenses under the terms of our affiliated dental practice service agreements represented  and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
due to growth in other revenue the declining percentage in is primarily due to the tooth doctor which was acquired in  and the decline in was due to revenue earned under our transition services agreement with pdg 
both the affiliated dental practices and company owned businesses can be affected by changes in the us economy that may influence discretionary spending for dental services not covered by dental benefit plans 
the tooth doctor business is directly affected by patient services reimbursed by state medicaid programs 
fees earned under service agreements include reimbursement of expenses incurred by us on behalf of the affiliated practices in connection with the operation and administration of dental facilities and business service fees charged to the affiliated practices pursuant to the terms of the service agreements for management services provided and capital committed by us 
under certain service agreements  representing of our business service fees  our business service fee consists of a monthly fee which is based upon a specified percentage of the amount by which the affiliated practice s patient revenue exceeds expenses 
under certain service agreements  
table of contents representing of our business service fees  our business service fee consists entirely of a fixed monthly fee determined by agreement of us and the affiliated practice in a formal planning process 
under certain other service agreements  representing less than of our business service fees  our business service fee consists of either a fixed monthly fee and an additional performance fee based upon a percentage of the amount by which the affiliated practice s patient revenue exceeds expenses as compared to the planned amount for the current year  a specified percentage of patient revenue or a specified percentage of collections on patient revenue 
in all instances  the business service fee is negotiated at fair market value for services provided and capital committed by us to the affiliated practices 
the company s net revenue from the reimbursement of expenses is accounted for on an accrual basis and is recognized when these expenses are incurred and billed to the affiliated practices 
reimbursement of expenses includes costs incurred by us for the operation and administration of the dental facilities that include salaries and benefits for non dentist personnel working at the dental facilities the administrative staff and  where permitted by law  the dental assistants and hygienists  lab fees  dental supplies  office occupancy costs of the dental facilities  depreciation related to the fixed assets at the dental facilities and other expenses such as professional fees  marketing costs and general and administrative expenses

for additional information on components of our net revenue  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
patient revenue of the affiliated practices we believe it is important to understand patient revenue of the affiliated practices 
this includes the practices that we do not control  nor own any equity interests in  and are affiliated with us by means of service agreements 
we do not consolidate the financial statements of these affiliated practices with ours  and accordingly their patient revenue is not a measure of our financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles because it is not our revenue 
it is however  a financial measure we use  along with the patient revenue of tooth doctor  to monitor operating performance and to help identify and analyze trends of the affiliated practices which may impact our business 
most of the operating expenses incurred by us  pursuant to service agreements  are on behalf of the affiliated practices in the operation of dental facilities 
these expenses are significantly affected by the patient revenue of the affiliated practices 
the affiliated practices generate revenue from providing care to patients and receive payment from patients and dental benefit providers  or payors  under fee for service  ppo plans and managed care capitation plans 
patient revenue reflects the amounts billed by an affiliated practice at its established rates reduced by any contractual adjustments and allowances for uncollectible accounts 
contractual adjustments represent discounts off established rates negotiated pursuant to certain dental benefit plan provider contracts with the affiliated practices 
while payor mix varies from market to market  the following table provides the aggregate payor mix of all affiliated practices  including tooth doctor  for the years ended december fee for service ppo and dental referral plans capitated managed care plans for the affiliated practices that we do not own and are affiliated with us by means of a service agreement  after collection of fees from patients and third party insurers for the provision of dental care and payment to us of our service fee and reimbursement of clinic expenses incurred by us on their behalf  the amounts remaining are used by these affiliated practices for compensation of dentists and  in certain states  hygienists and or dental assistants who are employed by these affiliated practices

liquidity and capital resources overview we have financed our operating and capital needs  including cash used for acquisitions and affiliations  capital expenditures and working capital  principally from operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving line of credit and term loan 
we have  in the past  also used proceeds from the sale of equity securities and the issuance of subordinated promissory notes to finance certain capital needs  but have not done so in recent years 
current credit market conditions the credit markets have recently experienced unprecedented volatility  which has affected both the availability and cost of debt financing 
in this current volatile credit environment  we have taken a number of initiatives to maintain our liquidity  including the following we largely eliminated incentive compensation expense accruals and as a result cash bonus payments associated with these accruals will be significantly reduced during the first quarter of  we have delayed compensation increases until the economic environment and our financial performance merit such increases  we have implemented a hiring freeze for non clinical positions and are evaluating all non essential positions  we have reduced valuations for affiliations and acquisitions and will complete only those that make both strategic and economic sense  and we have reduced capital expenditure expectations to approximately we have a  revolving credit facility and  term loan  both of which are senior secured facilities  are provided by commercial banks and have maturities of january  the availability of senior secured debt has been significantly reduced in the current credit markets which has resulted in increased borrowing rates  reduced financial covenants and higher upfront fees 
to the extent that we are not able to refinance our credit facilities in the senior credit markets or to obtain extensions from our existing lenders  we may need to seek financing from other sources  including the sale of subordinated debt  preferred stock or common stock 
these forms of financing may include interest payments  dividend payments and dilutive effects to our existing common stockholders 
we cannot assure you that such financing will be available or on terms acceptable to us

the increase of  in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to our term loan borrowing of  and increased net borrowings on our revolving credit facility of approximately  and to a lesser extent an increase of approximately  in benefits and proceeds from stock option exercises 
the increased borrowings were used to fund our acquisition and affiliation activities 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options increased in due to an increased number of option exercises compared to credit agreements in september  we increased the capacity of our revolving credit facility to  and extended the maturity to september  and we entered into a term loan agreement in the amount of  with a maturity of september all of the obligations under the term loan facility rank pari passu in right of payment to all of the obligations of our revolving credit facility 
as a result of the outcome of the litigation between pdg and us in december see litigation settlement agreements  on february   we entered into agreements to amend our revolving credit facility and term loan with our existing lenders 
pursuant to the agreements  the terms of the revolving credit facility and term loan were amended  including a reduction in the revolving credit facility to  establishing the maturity of both facilities at june  and increasing the borrowing costs under both facilities 
the amended facilities permitted us to borrow up to  annually for capital expenditures   annually for acquisitions and up to  for earn out and contingent payments on previously completed acquisitions  subject to a maximum debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization leverage ratio of x 
the revolving credit facility and term loan facility were amended on june  to extend the maturity from june  to july  if we had not amended the facilities prior to june  to extend the maturity date beyond june   we would have been required to classify these borrowings as a current versus a long term liability 
no other provisions of the loan agreements were amended on june  on october   we entered into agreements to amend the maturities and borrowing costs of our  revolving credit facility and  term loan with our existing lenders 
the maturity of both facilities was extended to january  borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at either prime or libor plus a margin  at the company s option 
the margin is based upon our debt coverage ratio and ranges from to for both prime and libor borrowings 
interest on the term loan is at libor plus a margin 
the margin is basis points from october  until february  and increases basis points each days thereafter 
we pay a commitment fee on the unused balance of our revolving credit facility ranging from to 
borrowings are limited to an availability formula based on earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization  adjusted for certain items  to a maximum of x and are secured by a first lien on substantially all of our assets  including a pledge of the stock of our subsidiaries 
the outstanding balance under this line as of december  was  and we had stand by letters of credit amounting to approximately  at december  at december  the libor based and prime interest rate for the term loan was and ranged from to for the revolving line of credit 
on december  we were in compliance with all credit agreements covenants 
on may   we entered into an interest rate swap to hedge  of our borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
under this arrangement  we have effectively converted our month  floating libor interest rate exposure  plus a credit spread  to fixed  plus a credit spread  until february 
table of contents contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period total thereafter long term debt revolving credit facility and term loan operating leases uncertain tax positions total in addition to these contractual obligations  future interest payments relating to our long term debt are fixed at rates between and and are due as follows  in and  in future interest obligations relating to our revolving credit facility and term loans are not determinable as the interest rates are variable and the agreements do not include a required principal repayment schedule 
in we hedged  of our market interest rate exposure at plus a credit spread resulting in minimum expected payments of  per year through operating lease payments include amounts which are to be reimbursed to us pursuant to the terms of our service agreements with the affiliated practices 
the amounts to be reimbursed by the affiliated practices are  and are due as follows  in   in   in  and  thereafter 
uncertain tax positions are taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return that may result in additional payments to tax authorities 
the amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of december  the total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the thereafter column as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments 
if a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires  then additional payments will not be necessary 
in certain affiliation or acquisition transactions we may be obligated to make deferred or contingent payments 
typically  these payments are based upon the achievement of revenue or earnings for an agreed upon period after the transaction 
the potential future payments under these agreements cannot exceed  in   in and  in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the carrying value of goodwill  receivables due from affiliated practices  other intangible assets  loss reserves for our captive insurance company and contingent accruals for litigation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and in certain instances actuarial studies conducted by third parties  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
valuation of accounts receivable our accounts receivable include amounts due from affiliated practices that have entered into service agreements with us and amounts due from insurance companies  patients and dentists for our tooth doctor  dental benefits third party administrator and dental laboratory businesses 
at december   amounts due from affiliated practices represented of our accounts receivable 

table of contents the carrying amount of receivables due from affiliated practices requires management to assess the collectability of the fees we earn pursuant to the service agreements 
collection of our service fees are dependent on the economic viability of the affiliated practices based on actual and expected future financial performance including collectability of the affiliated practices patient receivables  net of contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts 
the affiliated practices record revenue at established rates reduced by contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts to arrive at patient revenue 
contractual adjustments represent the difference between gross billable charges at established rates and the portion of those charges reimbursed pursuant to certain dental benefit plan provider contracts 
for contracts where there is no defined benefit  contractual adjustments are based upon historical collection experience and other relevant factors 
the affiliated practices provision for doubtful accounts is estimated in the period that services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as necessary 
the estimates for the provision and related allowance are based on an evaluation of historical collection experience  the aging profile of the accounts receivable  write off percentages and other relevant factors 
changes in these factors in future periods could result in increases or decreases in the provision 
in the event that final reimbursement or bad debt experience differs from original estimates  adjustments to the affiliated practices patient receivables would be required which could impact the collectability of our receivables due from affiliated practices 
except for accounts receivable due from pdg which we agreed to forgive pursuant to settlement of outstanding litigation  to date we have not recorded any losses related to our receivables due from affiliated practices and accordingly have not recorded any reserves for uncollectability 
we have recorded reserves for uncollectability against accounts receivable of our tooth doctor  dental benefits third party administrator and dental laboratory businesses based on historical collection experience  the aging profile of the accounts receivable  write off percentages and other relevant factors 
goodwill and intangible assets we have intangible assets  including goodwill and other identifiable intangibles assets  which are the result of affiliation transactions and acquisitions of businesses 
the initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of useful lives at the time of affiliation or acquisition involve the use of management judgments and estimates 
these estimates are based on  among other factors  reviews of projected future income  cash flows and statutory regulations 
at december   intangible assets were  and represented of our total assets  and goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets representing of our intangible assets and definite lived intangible assets related to service agreements representing of our intangible assets 
our affiliations with dental group practices as a result of the parties entering into a service agreement are not business combinations  and as such  do not result in recognition of goodwill 
we recognize capitalized service agreement costs which are accounted for as definite lived intangible assets acquired in affiliations other than a business combination  and are recorded at fair value 
in determining the fair value of a service agreement recognized in connection with an affiliation  management estimates the timing  amount and value of future expected cash flows 
these service agreements have contractual terms of years but the asset is generally amortized on a straight line basis over a period of years 
in the event a service agreement is terminated  the related affiliated practice is required  at our option in nearly all instances  to purchase the remaining unamortized balance of intangible assets at the current book value  purchase other assets at the greater of fair value or book value and assume leases and other liabilities related to the performance of our obligations under the service agreement 
we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
we test goodwill for impairment annually as of october and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has fallen below its carrying amount  such as a significant adverse change in the assets utilized by the business 
determining whether an impairment has occurred requires 
table of contents valuation of the respective reporting business unit  which we estimate using a discounted cash flow method 
when available and as appropriate  we consider market multiples to supplement the discounted cash flow analysis 
in applying this methodology  we rely on a number of factors  including actual operating results  future business plans  economic projections and market data 
if this analysis indicates goodwill is impaired  measuring the impairment requires a fair value estimate of each identified tangible and intangible asset 
in this case  we would supplement the cash flow approach discussed above with independent appraisals 
we tested goodwill for impairment as of october  which included various scenarios with varying revenue  expense and capital investment assumptions and determined there was no impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
subsequent to the annual testing  our market capitalization decreased significantly to below its book value 
we believe that this decline was the result of the financial markets reaction to the nation s deteriorating economic conditions and concerns about our ability to renegotiate our revolving credit facility and term loan facility 
in view of these developments  we reviewed our operating results subsequent to october  which included financial and key operating metrics as well as available market data  and concluded that an interim impairment test was not warranted 
there can be no assurance  however  that further deterioration of economic conditions will not materially or adversely effect our operations 
should the fair value of the company s goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets decline because necessary changes in assumptions of our impairment tests  or other circumstances that may indicate impairment  recognition of impairment may be necessary in the future which could be material 
while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumption to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and other intangible assets  it is possible a material change could occur in the future 
if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be required to perform the second step of the impairment analysis  which could result in a material impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets 
insurance we maintain various insurance coverages that we believe are appropriate for our business  including workers compensation  property  business interruption and general liability  among others 
in addition  the affiliated practices are required to maintain  or cause to be maintained  professional liability insurance with us as a named insured 
certain of our insurances are reinsured by a wholly owned captive insurance company licensed in the state of vermont 
several of these insurance programs have retention levels in which we and our captive insurance company are financially obligated for insured losses below certain financial thresholds before the insurer is financially obligated for insured losses 
we and our captive insurance company maintain reserves for certain of these programs  which are based upon estimates provided by third party actuaries or by individual case basis valuations 
changes in trends of loss severity or loss frequency may affect the calculation of these estimates and create the need for subsequent adjustments to estimated loss reserves 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provision of sfas no 
r 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected life  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected life volatility  and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in these assumptions for future stock option grants can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of stock based compensation 
income taxes our annual tax rate is based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions  including evaluating uncertainties under fasb interpretation no

table of contents required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements  and also provides guidance on the de recognition  measurement classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosures 
we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory rates applicable to future years to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities  as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
these sources of income inherently rely heavily on estimates 
we use our historical experience and our short and long range business forecasts to provide insight 
to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered  a valuation allowance is established 
we are subject to income tax arising from us federal and multiple state jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to examination by us federal and state taxing authorities 
the tax years  and remain open to examination  and on october   the internal revenue service notified us that it will examine our federal income tax return for the year ending december  our policy for recording interest and penalties associated with audits is to record such items as a component of income before taxes

and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flow 
to meet those objectives  this statement requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives  quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements 
this statement is effective for the company beginning january  the company is assessing the impact of sfas on its future consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
with regard to our revolving credit facility  we are also exposed to variable rate interest for the banks applicable margins ranging from to based upon our debt coverage ratio 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair value but do not impact earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flow 
we do not believe a one percentage point change in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair market value of our fixed rate debt 
in addition  we have entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to fix the interest rate on  of our long term debt borrowings 
the pre tax earnings and cash flow impact for one year  based upon the amounts outstanding at december  under our variable rate revolving credit facility and term loan  for each one percentage point change in interest rates would be approximately  per annum
