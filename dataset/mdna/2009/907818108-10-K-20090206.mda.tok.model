item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to the financial statements and supplementary data  item  and other information in this report  including risk factors set forth in item a and critical accounting policies and cautionary information at the end of this item the railroad  along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates  is our one reportable operating segment 
although we analyze revenue by commodity group  we analyze the net financial results of the railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network 
executive summary results safety we operated a safer railroad in  improving safety for all of our employees  customers  and the communities where we operate 
the employee injury incident rate per  man hours declined from to its lowest level ever 
a continued focus on derailment prevention in resulted in a reduction in incidents  with associated costs declining 
with respect to public safety  we closed grade crossings to reduce our exposure to incidents 
we also continued installing video cameras in our road locomotives and now have camera equipped locomotives in the lead position of over of our road trains 
these video cameras allow us to better analyze grade crossing conditions and incidents  increasing safety for our employees and the public 
the number of grade crossing incidents decreased during the year  to the lowest number on record 
also  through extensive trespass reduction programs  we were able to reduce trespasser incidents by 
all of these improvements are the result of comprehensive efforts to enhance employee training  increase public education  make targeted capital investments  and take proactive steps to eliminate or reduce safety risks 
financial performance in  we generated operating income of billion despite the recessionary economy 
yield increases  network management initiatives  and improved productivity drove the increase in operating income  more than offsetting a reduction in volume levels  which reflects deteriorating economic conditions during the year  particularly in the fourth quarter 
our operating ratio was for the year  a point improvement compared to net income of billion also exceeded our previous milestone  translating into earnings of per diluted share 
freight revenues our freight revenues grew year over year to billion 
we achieved record revenue levels in five of our six commodity groups  driven by better pricing and fuel cost recovery 
since  we have repriced approximately of our business 
overall  volume decreased in due to the weakening economy  driving lower demand in several market sectors  particularly the automotive  domestic housing and construction markets 
network operations in  we significantly improved the fluidity and efficiency of our transportation network 
continued focus on increasing velocity  eliminating work events  improving asset utilization  and expanding capacity were key drivers of our operational improvement 
lower volume levels also contributed to the increased efficiency 
we increased average train speed by  reduced average terminal dwell time by  and improved car utilization by with ongoing enhancements to our unified plan an ongoing program that streamlines segments of our transportation plan and by implementing initiatives to make train processing at our terminals more efficient 
we also expanded capacity and continued to use industrial engineering techniques to further improve network fluidity and improve asset utilization 
our customer satisfaction improved to record 
table of contents levels during  an indication that efforts to improve network operations translated into better customer service 
fuel prices crude oil prices increased at a steady rate through the first seven months of  closing at a record high of a barrel in early july 
as the economy worsened during the third and fourth quarters  fuel prices dropped dramatically  hitting per barrel in december  a near five year low 
despite these price declines toward the end of the year  our average fuel price increased by and added billion of operating expenses compared to our fuel surcharge programs helped offset the impact of higher fuel prices 
in addition  we reduced our consumption rate by  saving approximately million gallons of fuel during the year 
the use of newer  more fuel efficient locomotives  our fuel conservation programs  improved network operations  and a shift in commodity mix  primarily due to growth in bulk shipments  contributed to the improvement 
free cash flow cash generated by operating activities totaled a record billion  yielding free cash flow of million in free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities  less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid 
free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap by sec regulation g and item of sec regulation s k 
we believe free cash flow is important in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings 
free cash flow should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  cash provided by operating activities 
the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities gaap measure to free cash flow non gaap measure millions of dollars cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities dividends paid free cash flow outlook safety operating a safe railroad benefits our employees  our customers  our shareholders  and the public 
we will continue using a multi faceted approach to safety  utilizing technology  risk assessment  quality control  and training and engaging our employees 
we plan to continue implementation of total safety culture tsc throughout our operations 
tsc  an employee focused initiative that has helped improve safety  is a process designed to establish  maintain  and promote safety among co workers 
with respect to public safety  we will continue our efforts to maintain  upgrade  and close crossings  install video cameras on locomotives  and educate the public about crossing safety through various railroad and industry programs  along with other activities 
transportation plan in  we will continue to evaluate traffic flows and network logistic patterns to identify additional opportunities to simplify operations and improve network efficiency and asset utilization 
we plan to maintain adequate manpower and locomotives  and improve productivity using industrial engineering techniques 
fuel prices on average  we expect fuel prices to decrease substantially from the average price we paid in however  due to economic uncertainty  other global pressures  and weather incidents  fuel prices again could be volatile during the year 
to reduce the impact of fuel price on earnings  we 
table of contents will continue to seek recovery from our customers through our fuel surcharge programs and expand our fuel conservation efforts 
capital plan in  we expect our total capital investments to be approximately billion which may be revised if business conditions or new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments 
see further discussion in this item under liquidity and capital resources capital plan 
financial expectations we are cautious about the economic environment  however  we anticipate continued pricing opportunities  network improvement  and increased productivity in results of operations operating revenues millions of dollars change v change v freight revenues other revenues total freight revenues are revenues generated by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups 
freight revenues vary with volume carloads and average revenue per car arc 
arc is driven by changes in price  traffic mix and fuel surcharges 
as a result of contractual obligations with some of our customers  we have provided incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations  which we record as a reduction to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments 
we recognize freight revenues on a percentage of completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination 
we allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them 
other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries  revenues from our commuter rail operations  and accessorial revenues  which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage 
we recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations 
freight revenues from five of the six commodity groups increased during  with particularly strong growth from agricultural and energy shipments 
while revenues generated from chemical and industrial products shipments grew in compared to  hurricanes gustav and ike reduced shipments of these commodities 
revenues generated from automotive shipments declined versus greater fuel cost recoveries and core pricing improvement combined to increase arc during fuel cost recoveries include fuel surcharge revenue and the impact of resetting the base fuel price for certain traffic  as described below in more detail 
the severe economic downturn during the fourth quarter compounded already declining volumes experienced during the first nine months of due to ongoing weakness in certain market sectors 
as a result  we moved fewer intermodal  automotive  industrial products  and chemical shipments  which more than offset volume growth from agricultural and energy shipments 
our fuel surcharge programs excluding index based contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel generated billion in freight revenues during fuel surcharge revenue is not comparable to prior periods due to the implementation of new mileage based fuel surcharge programs beginning in april for regulated traffic 
as previously disclosed in our annual report on form k  the stb 
table of contents issued a decision limiting the manner in which us railroads can calculate fuel surcharges on traffic regulated by the stb 
effective april   we implemented new fuel surcharge programs covering this regulated traffic  which represents approximately of our revenue base 
these new programs use mileage as opposed to percent of revenue as the basis for calculating fuel surcharges  and they use the on highway diesel price index published by the energy information administration for purposes of determining fuel costs 
the new programs affect fuel surcharges assessed for certain shipments of agricultural  chemical  and industrial products  and  to a lesser extent  coal 
in addition  we reset the effective base fuel price at which our new mileage based fuel surcharge programs take effect  resulting in a higher starting point of per gallon versus per gallon 
we also converted a portion of our non regulated traffic to mileage based fuel surcharge programs 
the resetting of the fuel price at which the fuel surcharge begins  in conjunction with rebasing the affected transportation rates to include a portion of what had been in the fuel surcharge  did not materially change our freight revenues  as higher base rates offset lower fuel surcharge revenue 
freight revenues from five of our six commodity groups increased during  while revenues generated from industrial products shipments declined 
arc increased during driven by core price improvement 
lower shipments of industrial and agricultural products drove volume down in  more than offsetting an increase in chemical shipments 
our fuel surcharge programs excluding index based contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel generated billion in freight revenues in fuel surcharge revenues are not comparable to prior periods due to implementation of new mileage based fuel surcharge programs for certain traffic  as described above 
other revenues increased in versus driven by higher revenues from both our commuter rail operations and our subsidiary that brokers intermodal services 
accessorial revenues also increased in both periods due to improved collection rates 
the following tables summarize the year over year changes in freight revenues  revenue carloads  and arc by commodity type freight revenues millions of dollars change v change v agricultural automotive chemicals energy industrial products intermodal total revenue carloads thousands change v change v agricultural automotive chemicals energy industrial products intermodal total 
table of contents average revenue per car change v change v agricultural automotive chemicals energy industrial products intermodal average agricultural products price improvements  fuel surcharges  and volume growth generated higher agricultural freight revenue in versus strong global demand for grain and a weak dollar drove higher shipments of corn and feed grains and shipments of wheat and food grains for shipments of ethanol  a grain product used as an alternative fuel and fuel additive  and its co products primarily livestock feed also increased 
price increases were the primary drivers of agricultural freight revenue in versus  partially offset by a decline in volume levels 
shipments of whole grains used in feed declined as barge operators captured more shipments destined for export from the gulf coast due to both favorable barge rates and improved navigation conditions on the mississippi river 
conversely  wheat and food grain shipments improved as a strong wheat crop generated record shipments to the gulf coast for export 
shipments of ethanol and its co products also increased substantially 
agricultural revenue logo automotive double digit declines in shipments of both finished vehicles and auto parts drove freight revenue lower in compared to price improvements and fuel surcharges partially offset these lower volumes 
the manufacturers experienced poor sales and reduced vehicle production during due to the recessionary economy  which in turn reduced shipments of finished vehicles and parts 
in addition  a major parts supplier strike reduced volume levels compared to shipments of finished vehicles decreased in versus in  price increases drove the growth in automotive revenue  partially offset by lower finished vehicle shipments versus a decline in vehicle production levels primarily drove the volume decline 
conversely  automotive parts shipments grew due to increased volumes from domestic manufacturers  new business acquired in the middle of  and our new intermodal train service between mexico and michigan 
automotive revenue logo 
table of contents chemicals price improvements and increased fuel surcharges drove higher revenue from chemicals shipments during  which were partially offset by a decrease in volume levels compared to weak market conditions and business interruptions in chemical producing areas resulting from hurricanes gustav and ike all contributed to lower liquid and dry chemicals shipments 
plastics shipments also declined in part due to the impact of hurricanes gustav and ike 
price increases and volume growth drove the increase in revenue in versus strong demand for potash exports through pacific northwest ports and a robust planting season for corn to supply ethanol producers increased demand for fertilizer shipments in new business acquired in june contributed to more shipments of plastics 
soda ash volume increased as export demand grew in the gulf area and mexico 
lower production at canadian locations during the year boosted shipments of liquid and dry chemicals from us sources 
chemicals revenue logo energy price increases  fuel surcharges  and higher volume produced revenue growth in versus shipments from the sprb were up compared to despite mine flooding and network interruptions caused by extensive flooding in the midwest in june of conversely  shipments from the colorado and utah mines were down in versus  due to mine production problems 
price increases during improved both revenue and arc over levels 
volume was flat  however  as severe storms in the first quarter and heavy rains in may flooded coal pits in the sprb  which closed several rail lines and reduced volume levels 
shipments from the colorado and utah mines were down due to lower mine production  predominately in the fourth quarter of energy revenue logo 
table of contents industrial products price improvements and fuel surcharges contributed to higher freight revenue in compared to lower volume partially offset these increases 
continued softening of the housing market and weak market conditions resulted in lower lumber shipments 
in addition  cement and stone shipments declined due to a weak overall residential and commercial construction market 
business interruptions resulting from the hurricanes also reduced various construction related shipments  primarily stone 
conversely  we shipped more steel in than in as the weak dollar increased the cost of steel imports during most of the year  creating a strong demand for domestic steel 
volume declines more than offset price increases  driving industrial products revenue lower in compared to continued softening of the housing construction market  surplus inventories  and general market uncertainty resulted in lower lumber shipments 
delays of rail expansion projects  customer production problems  unfavorable weather  and the ongoing impact of a weak residential construction market reduced stone shipments during the year 
industrial products revenue logo intermodal price increases and fuel surcharges generated higher revenue in  partially offset by lower volume levels 
international traffic declined in  reflecting continued softening of imports from china and the loss of a customer contract 
notably  the peak intermodal shipping season  which usually starts in the third quarter  was particularly weak in additionally  continued weakness in domestic housing and automotive sectors translated into weak demand in large sectors of the international intermodal market  which also contributed to lower volumes 
domestic traffic declined in due to the loss of a customer contract and lower volumes from less than truckload shippers 
additionally  the flood related embargo on traffic in the midwest during the second quarter hindered intermodal volume levels in intermodal revenue logo price increases improved intermodal revenue in compared to volume was flat versus as increased domestic traffic due to new service offerings and increased business under some of our older  long term contracts were offset by a decrease of premium shipments 
international traffic was flat in compared to due to general softening of imports from asia 
mexico business the results for each commodity group include shipments to and from mexico 
revenue from mexico business increased to billion in compared to price improvements and fuel surcharges contributed to these increases  partially offset by a decline in volume in compared to revenue from mexico business increased to billion in compared to price increases and more shipments of automotive parts and intermodal containers drove revenue growth in

operating expenses millions of dollars change v change v compensation and benefits fuel purchased services and materials depreciation equipment and other rents other total operating expenses increased million in our fuel price per gallon rose during the year  increasing operating expenses by billion compared to wage  benefit  and materials inflation  higher depreciation  and costs associated with the january cascade mudslide and hurricanes gustav and ike also increased expenses during the year 
cost savings from productivity improvements  better resource utilization  and lower volume helped offset these increases 
operating expenses increased million in versus higher fuel prices  which rose during the period  increased operating expenses by million 
wage  benefit and materials inflation and higher depreciation expense also increased expenses during the year 
productivity improvements  better resource utilization  and a lower fuel consumption rate helped offset these increases 
operating expenses logo compensation and benefits compensation and benefits include wages  payroll taxes  health and welfare costs  pension costs  other postretirement benefits  and incentive costs 
productivity initiatives in all areas  combined with lower volume  led to a decline in our workforce for  saving million compared to conversely  general wage and benefit inflation and higher pension and postretirement benefits increased expenses in  partially offsetting these reductions 
operational improvements and lower volume levels in led to a decline in our workforce  saving million in compared to a smaller workforce and less need for new train personnel reduced training costs during the year  which contributed to the improvement 
general wage and benefit inflation mostly offset the reductions  reflecting higher salaries and wages and the impact of higher healthcare and other benefit costs 
fuel fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and non highway vehicles and heavy equipment 
diesel fuel prices  which averaged per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in compared to per gallon in  increased expenses by billion 
a improvement in our fuel consumption rate resulted in million of cost savings due to the use of newer  more fuel

in  higher contract costs including restoration costs related to the january cascade mudslide  june midwest flooding  and september hurricanes increased expenses million compared to higher material costs for freight car wheel sets during the year and an increase in the number of wheel sets required to repair flood damaged freight cars also contributed to higher materials expense in conversely  rail scrap proceeds associated with our rail replacement program partially offset these increases for the year 
higher consulting fees and higher contract expenses including equipment maintenance increased costs by million in compared to crew transportation and lodging costs increased million in due to higher gas prices and rate inflation 
increased use of higher cost components to repair and maintain our fleet of locomotives including a growing number of units not covered by warranties added million to materials expense during conversely  we used fewer parts for freight car repairs due to program maintenance scheduling  which lowered costs by million in compared to we also incurred lower drayage expense in compared to depreciation the majority of depreciation relates to track structure  including rail  ties  and other track material 
a higher depreciable asset base  reflecting higher capital spending in recent years  increased depreciation expense in versus  and in versus equipment and other rents equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies  freight car  intermodal  and locomotive leases  other specialty equipment leases  and office and other rentals 
fewer shipments of finished vehicles  industrial products and intermodal containers reduced our short term freight car rental expense by million in compared to lower lease expense for freight cars  intermodal containers  and locomotives also decreased costs 
conversely  lease expense for fleet vehicles increased costs in compared to fewer shipments of industrial products  combined with improved car cycle times  which reflect operational improvement and better asset utilization  reduced our short term freight car rental expense by million in compared to lower lease expenses for freight cars  intermodal containers  and fleet vehicles and equipment decreased costs by million in conversely  higher locomotive lease expense resulted in a million increase in costs during the year 
other other costs include personal injury costs  freight and property damage  insurance  environmental expense  state and local taxes  utilities  telephone and cellular expenses  employee travel expense  and computer software and other general expenses 
other costs were higher in compared to due to an increase in bad debts  state and local taxes  utility costs  and other miscellaneous expenses totaling million 
conversely  casualty expenses including costs for personal injuries  asbestos related claims  freight and property damage  insurance  and environmental costs were million lower in 
table of contents compared to we reduced personal injury expense by million in as a result of fewer than expected claims and lower than expected average settlement costs 
in  we reduced personal injury expense and asbestos related costs million based on the results of updated personal injury actuarial studies and a reassessment of our potential liability for resolution of current and future asbestos claims 
in addition  environmental and toxic tort expenses were million lower in compared to other costs were lower in compared to driven primarily by a reduction in personal injury expense 
actuarial studies completed during resulted in a reduction in personal injury expense of million  which was partially offset by an adverse development with respect to one claim 
settlement of insurance claims in related to hurricane rita  and higher equity income also drove expenses lower in versus conversely  the year over year comparison was affected by the settlement of insurance claims totaling million in related to the january west coast storm and a million gain in from the sale of two company owned airplanes 
non operating items millions of dollars change v change v other income interest expense income taxes other income other income decreased in compared to due to lower gains from real estate sales and decreased returns on cash investments reflecting lower interest rates 
higher rental and licensing income and lower interest expense on our sale of receivables program partially offset the decreases 
lower net gains from non operating asset sales primarily real estate drove the reduction in other income in recognition of rental income in from the settlement of a rent dispute also contributed to the year over year decrease in other income 
cash investment returns increased million due to larger cash balances and higher interest rates 
interest expense interest expense increased in versus due to a higher weighted average debt level of billion  compared to billion in a lower effective interest rate of in  compared to in  partially offset the effects of the higher weighted average debt level 
an increase in the weighted average debt levels to billion from billion in generated higher interest expense in a lower effective interest rate of in  compared to in  partially offset the effects of the higher debt level 
income taxes income taxes were higher in compared to  driven by higher pre tax income 
our effective tax rates were and in and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate in resulted from several reductions in tax expense related to federal audits and state tax law changes 
in addition  the effective tax rate in was increased by illinois legislation that increased deferred tax expense in the third quarter of income taxes were million higher in compared to  due primarily to higher pre tax income and the effect of new tax legislation in the state of illinois that changed how we determine the amount of our income subject to illinois tax

average terminal dwell time improved and in and  respectively 
lower volumes combined with initiatives to more timely deliver rail cars to our interchange partners and customers improved dwell time in both periods 
gross and revenue ton miles gross ton miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled 
revenue ton miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles 
gross ton miles decreased  while revenue ton miles were flat in compared to with commodity mix changes notably autos and coal explaining the variance in year over year growth between the two metrics 
in  revenue ton miles declined in relation to the reduction in carloadings compared to gross ton miles decreased in driven by a mix shift in freight shipments 
operating ratio operating ratio is defined as our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue 
our operating ratios improved points to in and points to in price increases  fuel cost recoveries  network management initiatives  and improved productivity more than offset the impact of higher fuel prices 
employees productivity initiatives and lower volumes reduced employee levels throughout the company in versus fewer train and engine personnel due to improved network productivity and lower volume drove the change while productivity initiatives within the support organizations also contributed to a lower full time equivalent force level

our december  debt to capital ratios increased as a result of a billion net increase in debt from december   and purchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program  partially offset by an increase in retained earnings due to higher earnings in equity at december   was reduced by million for other comprehensive losses 
equity at december   was reduced by million for other comprehensive losses 
other comprehensive losses in both years were related primarily to pensions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item for more information 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  the sale of certain receivables  and our revolving credit facility  as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets 
we had billion of committed credit available under our credit facility  with no borrowings outstanding as of december  we did not make any borrowings under this facility during the year 
the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the sale of receivables program was million as of december  the sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements  including maintenance of an investment grade bond rating 
if our bond rating were to deteriorate  it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity 
access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions 
deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity 
access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability 
although both short and long 
table of contents term debt  including commercial paper  bank provided credit  and publicly issued bonds  are more expensive than in recent years  we currently have access to liquidity through commercial paper and our credit facility 
we also expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity by issuing bonds to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets and recent debt transactions  including our issuance of long term debt during the fourth quarter 
at december   and december   we had a working capital deficit of approximately million and million  respectively 
a working capital deficit is common in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity 
we maintain adequate resources and  when necessary  have access to capital to meet any daily and short term cash requirements  and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 
cash flows millions of dollars cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents operating activities higher net income in and changes in working capital combined to increase cash provided by operating activities 
in addition  accelerated tax deductions enacted in on certain new operating assets resulted in lower income tax payments in voluntary pension contributions in totaling million and other pension contributions of million partially offset the year over year increase 
higher net income in was the primary driver of increased cash provided by operating activities 
a favorable comparison due to voluntary pension contributions in totaling million also contributed to the year over year increase 
these increases were partially offset by cash payments representing prior period wage increases in accordance with recent union contract ratifications and higher income tax payments 
investing activities increased capital investments and lower proceeds from asset sales drove the increase in cash used in investing activities in compared to higher capital investments and work in process balances drove the increase in cash used in investing in versus the table below details cash capital investments for the years ended december    and millions of dollars track capacity and commercial facilities locomotives and freight cars technology and other total capital plan in  we expect our total capital investments to be approximately billion which may be revised if business conditions or new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient 
table of contents returns on these investments 
we expect approximately of our capital investments will replace and renew existing capital assets 
major investment categories include replacement and improvement of track infrastructure  increasing network and terminal capacity  locomotive and freight car fleet  including the acquisition of high horsepower locomotives  and technology improvements  including the testing of positive train control  and other capital projects 
we expect to fund our cash capital investments through cash generated from operations  the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties  issuance of long term debt  and cash on hand at december  our annual capital plan is a critical component of our long term strategic plan  which we expect will enhance the long term value of the corporation for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to i replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations  ii increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track  and iii make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for long term growth 
financing activities cash used in financing activities increased in versus due to higher debt repayments of million  an increase of million for the repurchase of common shares see further discussion of common shares in market for the registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters  and issuer purchases of equity securities purchases of equity securities part ii  item and an increase of dividends paid  reflecting a higher quarterly dividend 
higher debt issuances of million partially offset these increases 
the increase in cash used in financing activities in resulted primarily from the use of billion to repurchase common shares  payment of higher dividends  and lower net proceeds from equity compensation plans million in compared to million in 
these increases were mostly offset by debt issuances of billion in compared to no issuances in credit facilities on december   we had billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility the facility 
the facility is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper 
we did not draw on the facility during commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated  investment grade borrowers 
the facility allows borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates  plus a spread  depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings 
the facility requires union pacific corporation to maintain a debt to net worth coverage ratio as a condition to making a borrowing 
at december   and december  and at all times during these periods  we were in compliance with this covenant 
the definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debt to net worth coverage ratio includes  among other things  certain credit arrangements  capital leases  guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under title iv of erisa 
at december   the debt to net worth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to billion of debt as defined in the facility  and we had billion of debt as defined in the facility outstanding at that date 
under our current capital plans  we expect to continue to satisfy the debt to net worth coverage ratio  however  many factors beyond our reasonable control including the risk factors in item a of this report could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future 
the facility does not include any other financial restrictions  credit rating triggers other than rating dependent pricing  or any other provision that could require us to post collateral 
the facility also includes a million cross default provision and a change of control provision 
the term of the facility will expire in april  and we currently intend to replace the facility with a substantially similar credit agreement on or before the expiration date  which is consistent with our past practices with respect to our credit facilities 
at december   we had million of commercial paper outstanding 
our commercial paper balance is supported by our revolving credit facility but does not reduce the amount of borrowings available under the facility 
during  we issued million of commercial paper  including 
table of contents million issued in september and october as the credit and financial markets deteriorated  and repaid million 
at december   we reclassified as long term debt approximately million of debt due within one year that we intend to refinance 
this reclassification reflected our ability and intent to refinance any short term borrowings and certain current maturities of long term debt on a long term basis 
at december   we reclassified as long term debt approximately million of debt due within one year that we intended to refinance at that time 
operating lease activities during  the railroad  as lessee  entered into long term operating lease arrangements covering locomotives  rail cars  and  intermodal containers with a total equipment cost of approximately million 
in total  these new lease arrangements will provide for minimum rental payments of approximately million  with a present value of approximately million 
the lessors financed the purchase of the locomotives  rail cars  and intermodal containers  in part by issuing equipment notes that are non recourse to the railroad and are secured by assignments of the underlying leases and security interests in the equipment 
the corporation and the railroad do not guaranty payment of the equipment notes 
the railroad s obligations to make operating lease payments under the leases are recourse obligations and are not recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position 
the railroad has certain renewal and purchase options with respect to the locomotives  rail cars  and intermodal containers 
if the railroad does not exercise these options  the equipment will be returned to the lessors at the end of the lease term 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges for each of the years ended december    and  our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was   and  respectively 
higher net income drove the increases in and the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis 
earnings represent income from continuing operations  less equity earnings net of distributions  plus fixed charges and income taxes 
fixed charges represent interest charges  amortization of debt discount  and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges 
see exhibit to this report for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges 
common shareholders equity dividends on july   we increased the quarterly dividend to per share  payable beginning on october   to shareholders of record on august  we funded the increase in the quarterly dividend through cash generated from operations  the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties  and cash on hand during the fourth quarter 
dividend restrictions our revolving credit facility includes a debt to net worth covenant that  under certain circumstances  restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders 
the amount of retained earnings available for dividends was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
stock split on may   we completed a two for one stock split  effected in the form of a stock dividend 
the stock split entitled all shareholders of record at the close of business on may   to receive one additional share of our common stock  par value per share  for each share of common stock held on that date

these debt securities include change of control provisions 
we have no immediate plans to issue equity securities  however  we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration  and  therefore  we may issue additional debt securities at any time 
on april   we borrowed million under a year term loan facility the loan 
the loan has a floating rate based on london interbank offered rates  plus a spread  and is prepayable in whole or in part without a premium prior to maturity 
the agreement documenting the loan has provisions similar to our revolving credit facility  including identical debt to net worth covenant and change of control provisions and similar customary default provisions 
the agreement does not include any other financial restrictions  credit rating triggers  or any other provision that would require us to post collateral 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  and commercial commitments as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below  we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements sale of receivables the railroad transfers most of its accounts receivable to union pacific receivables  inc upri  a bankruptcy remote subsidiary  as part of a sale of receivables facility 
upri sells  without recourse on a day revolving basis  an undivided interest in such accounts receivable to investors 
the total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was million and million at december  and  respectively 
upri reduced the outstanding undivided interest held by investors due to a decrease in available receivables at december  the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors is not included in our consolidated financial statements 
the value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by  million and  million of accounts receivable held by upri at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  the value of the interest retained by upri was million and million  respectively 
this retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our consolidated financial statements 
the interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value  which approximates fair value  and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction 
the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks  including default and dilution 
if default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point  the amount of eligible receivables would decrease by million 
should our credit rating fall below investment grade  the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced  and  in certain cases  the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility 
the railroad services the sold receivables  however  the railroad does not recognize any servicing asset or liability as the servicing fees adequately compensate us for these responsibilities 
the railroad collected approximately billion and billion during the years ended december  and  respectively 
upri used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility 
the costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the costs include interest  program fees paid to banks  commercial paper issuing costs  and fees for unused commitment availability 
the investors have no recourse to the railroad s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims 
creditors of the railroad do not have recourse to the assets of upri 
in october  we extended the sale of receivables program to august without any significant changes in terms  except to increase the capacity to sell undivided interests to million 
the capacity was increased to million in december at january  the amount utilized under the sale of receivables program was million 
guarantees at december   we were contingently liable for million in guarantees 
we have recorded a liability of million and million for the fair value of these obligations as of december  and  respectively 
we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business  and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building  equipment financings  and affiliated operations 
the final guarantee expires in we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees 
we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 

table of contents other matters inflation the cumulative effect of long periods of inflation significantly increases asset replacement costs for capital intensive companies 
as a result  assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels  depreciation charges on an inflation adjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 
derivative financial instruments we may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices 
we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and  by policy  do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged  both at inception and throughout the hedged period 
we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items at inception  as well as our risk management objectives  strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions  and method of assessing hedge effectiveness 
changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings 
we may use swaps  collars  futures  and or forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices  however  the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable price movements 
market and credit risk we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item 
we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments  which is minimal  by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements 
at december  and  we were not required to provide collateral  nor had we received collateral  relating to our hedging activities 
determination of fair value we determine the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or the present value of expected future cash flows 
sensitivity analyses the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition 
these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 
at december   we had variable rate debt representing approximately of our total debt 
if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in than our december  variable rate  which was approximately  our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variable rate debt at december  market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december   and amounts to an increase of approximately million to the fair value of our debt at december  we estimated the fair values of our fixed rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 
interest rate fair value hedges we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period 
we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings 
we employ derivatives  primarily swaps  as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix 
in addition  we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed rate debt securities 

table of contents swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates 
we account for swaps as fair value hedges using the short cut method pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  therefore  we do not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate cash flow hedges we report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings 
at both december  and  we had reductions of million  recorded as an accumulated other comprehensive loss that is being amortized on a straight line basis through september  as of december  and  we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 
accounting pronouncements in march  fasb issued statement no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas amends and expands the disclosure requirements of fas to clarify how and why companies use derivative instruments 
in addition  fas requires more disclosures regarding how companies account for derivative instruments and the impact derivatives have on a company s financial statements 
this statement is effective for us beginning in and will only impact our disclosures 
it will have no impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows

fas is effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
fas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb released fsp eitf on emerging issues task force issue  participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
eitf 
the staff position concludes that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities as defined in eitf  and therefore  should be included in computing earnings per share using the two class method 
as discussed in note  we pay nonforfeitable dividends on our unvested retention awards and performance retention awards 
this staff position will be effective for us beginning in we expect that this staff position will result in additional disclosure only and not affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fsp fas r  employers disclosure about postretirement benefit plan assets  which amends statement r to require more detailed disclosures about employers pension plan assets 
new disclosures will include more information on investment strategies  major categories of plan assets  concentrations of risk within plan assets and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets 
this new standard requires new disclosures only  and will have no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
these new disclosures will be required for us beginning in our form k 
asserted and unasserted claims various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries 
we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity  however  to the extent possible  where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated  we have recorded a liability 
we do not expect that any known lawsuits  claims  environmental costs  commitments  contingent liabilities  or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our 
table of contents consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity after taking into account liabilities previously recorded for these matters 
indemnities our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements  including certain tax indemnifications  can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount  depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements 
due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved  we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements 
we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 
climate change although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item a of this report  we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact 
however  we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment  including investments in new technologies  using training programs to reduce fuel consumption  and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note to the financial statements and supplementary data  item these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 
asbestos we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos 
we engage a third party with extensive experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestos related claims to assist us in assessing our potential liability 
this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs 
the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions the ratio of future claims by alleged disease would be consistent with historical averages 
the number of claims filed against us will decline each year 
the average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to historical averages 
the percentage of claims dismissed in the future will be equivalent to historical averages 

table of contents our asbestos related liability activity was as follows millions of dollars beginning balance accruals credits payments ending balance at december current portion  ending balance at december approximately of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately related to unasserted claims at december  these claims are expected to be paid out over the next years 
in conjunction with the liability update performed in  we also reassessed estimated insurance recoveries 
we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december  and we will continue to review actual experience and adjust our estimate as warranted 
our asbestos related claims activity was as follows open claims  beginning balance new claims settled or dismissed claims open claims  ending balance at december we believe that our estimates of liability for asbestos related claims and insurance recoveries are reasonable and probable 
the amounts recorded for asbestos related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts 
however  future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed each year  average settlement costs  and insurance coverage issues  could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts 
estimates also may vary in the future if strategies  activities  and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change  federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants  and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants 
environmental we are subject to federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations 
we identified sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements 
this includes sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government  of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list 
certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites  consequently  our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties  in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

table of contents our environmental liability activity was as follows millions of dollars beginning balance accruals payments ending balance at december current portion  ending balance at december our environmental site activity was as follows open sites  beginning balance new sites closed sites open sites  ending balance at december when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned  leased  or otherwise used in our business  we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property 
we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred 
we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and we can reasonably estimate such costs 
we do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable 
the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites  as well as ongoing monitoring costs  but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties 
cost estimates are based on information available for each site  financial viability of other potentially responsible parties  and existing technology  laws  and regulations 
the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties  site specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties  the degree of contamination by various wastes  the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites  and the speculative nature of remediation costs 
estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal  state  and local laws governing environmental remediation as well as changes to the remediation plan for each site 
current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity 
personal injury the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year 
we use third party actuaries to assist us in measuring the expense and liability  including unasserted claims 
the federal employers liability act fela governs compensation for work related accidents 
under fela  damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlements 
we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

table of contents our personal injury liability is discounted to present value using applicable us treasury rates 
approximately of the recorded liability related to asserted claims  and approximately related to unasserted claims at december  estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 
our personal injury liability activity was as follows millions of dollars beginning balance accruals payments ending balance at december current portion  ending balance at december our personal injury claims activity was as follows open claims  beginning balance new claims settled or dismissed claims open claims  ending balance at december property and depreciation our rail operations are highly capital intensive 
each year we develop a capital program for the acquisition or construction of fixed assets 
assets purchased or constructed throughout the year that were not part of the original program are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria  which are approved by the stb 
properties are carried at cost  and we follow the group method of depreciation 
our large base of homogeneous  network type assets turns over on a continuous basis 
the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources  not as singular items 
under group depreciation  all items with similar physical characteristics  use  and expected life are grouped together in a single asset class  and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates 
the cost net of salvage of depreciable rail property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized 
a gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition because the gain or loss is not part of rail operations 
we compute depreciation principally on the straight line method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property 
we use a unit of production convention to depreciate rail in high density traffic corridors 
we calculate service lives using company specific retirement data 
we perform and submit depreciation rate studies to the stb at least every three years for equipment and every six years for road property ie  rail and other track material  ties  and ballast 
these rate studies are reviewed and approved by the stb 
these studies are used to develop our approved composite depreciation rates by asset class 
during  we completed depreciation rate studies for both track and road property  which will be used to calculate depreciation expense in and beyond 
when we purchase an asset  we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use 
however  many of our assets are self constructed 
a large portion of our capital expenditures is for track structure expansion capacity projects and replacement program projects  which is typically performed by our employees 
approximately of our full time equivalent employees are dedicated to the construction of capital assets 
costs that are directly attributable or overhead costs that relate directly to 
table of contents capital projects are capitalized 
direct costs that are capitalized as part of self constructed assets include material  labor  and work equipment 
indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset 
these costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases 
the capitalization of indirect costs is consistent with fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects 
general and administrative expenditures are expensed as incurred 
normal repairs and maintenance are also expensed as incurred  while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset  improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized 
assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease 
amortization expense is computed using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease 
significant capital spending in recent years increased the total value of our depreciable assets 
cash capital spending totaled billion for the year ended december   while depreciation expense totaled billion 
we use various methods to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property 
variances to these estimates could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year  annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately million 
if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year  annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately million 
income taxes as required under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
these expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted  the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as a change in the corporate tax rate  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
for example  a increase in the federal income tax rate would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately million 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based on management s judgments regarding the best available evidence about future events 
when we have claimed tax benefits that may be challenged by a tax authority  these uncertain tax positions are accounted for under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
we adopted fin beginning january  prior to  income tax contingencies were accounted for under fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
under fin  we recognize tax benefits only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon settlement 
a liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards 
pension and other postretirement benefits we use third party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees 
in order to use actuarial methods to value the 
table of contents liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions 
the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets 
for opeb  the critical assumptions are the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rate 
we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually  and selected assumptions are based on the following factors discount rate is based on a mercer yield curve of high quality corporate bonds rated aa by a recognized rating agency for which the timing and amount of cash flows matches our plans expected benefit payments 
expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return  taking into consideration current and expected market conditions 
healthcare cost trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions 
the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension and opeb expense for and the estimated impact on pension and opeb expense relative to a change in those assumptions assumptions pension opeb discount rate salary increase n a expected return on plan assets n a healthcare cost trend rate pre current n a pre level in n a post current n a post level in n a sensitivities increase in expense millions of dollars pension opeb decrease in discount rate increase in salary scale n a decrease in expected return on plan assets n a increase in healthcare cost trend rate n a cautionary information certain statements in this report  and statements in other reports or information filed or to be filed with the sec as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us  are  or will be  forward looking statements as defined by the securities act of and the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements and information include  without limitation  statements in the chairman s letter preceding part i regarding long term demand  capital investments  the economic outlook  and our financial position  statements regarding dividends in item and statements and information set forth under the captions outlook and liquidity and capital resources in this item  and any other statements or information in this report including information incorporated herein by reference regarding expectations as to operational or service improvements  expectations regarding the effectiveness of steps taken or to be taken to improve operations  service  infrastructure improvements  and transportation plan modifications including statements set forth in item
