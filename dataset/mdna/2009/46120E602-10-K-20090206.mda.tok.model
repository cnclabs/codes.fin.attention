we design  manufacture and market da vinci surgical systems  which are advanced surgical systems that we believe represent a new generation of surgery 
the da vinci surgical system consists of a surgeon s console  a patient side cart and a high performance vision system 
the product line also includes proprietary wristed instruments and surgical accessories 
the da vinci surgical system seamlessly translates the surgeon s natural hand movements on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions  or ports 
we believe that the da vinci surgical 
table of contents system is the only commercially available technology that can provide the surgeon with intuitive control  range of motion  fine tissue manipulation capability and d hd visualization  while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of minimally invasive surgery  or mis 
by placing computer enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient  we believe that the da vinci surgical system enables surgeons to improve clinical outcomes while reducing the invasiveness of complex surgical procedures 
the da vinci surgical system is sold into multiple surgical specialties  principally urology  gynecology  cardiothoracic  and general surgery 
business model 
in our business model  we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da vinci surgical systems as well as recurring revenue  comprised of instrument  accessory  and service revenue 
the da vinci surgical system generally sells for approximately million to million  depending on configuration  and includes one year of service  and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers 
we then generate recurring revenue as our customers purchase our endowrist instruments and accessory products for use in performing procedures with the da vinci surgical system 
endowrist instruments and accessories will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery and will need to be replaced as they are consumed 
we generate additional recurring revenue from ongoing system service 
we typically enter into service contracts at the time the system is sold 
these service contracts have been generally renewable at the end of the service period  typically at an annual rate of approximately  to  per year  depending on configuration of the underlying system 
since the introduction of the da vinci surgical system in  our established base of da vinci surgical systems has grown and robotic surgery volume has increased 
recurring revenue has grown at an equal or faster rate than system revenue over the three years ending december  recurring revenue generated from the sales of instruments and accessories and services increased from million  or of total revenue  in to million  or of total revenue  in to million  or of total revenue  in we expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future 
regulatory activities we believe that we have obtained all of the clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the united states 
as we make additions to target procedures  we will continue to obtain the necessary clearance 
the following table lists chronologically our fda clearances to date july general laparoscopic procedures march non cardiac thoracoscopic procedures may prostatectomy procedures november cardiotomy procedures july cardiac revascularization procedures march urologic surgical procedures april gynecologic surgical procedures june pediatric surgical procedures in march we received clearance to market our system held cardiac stabilizer and permission to remove the warning in our labeling regarding system use in non arrested heart procedures 
business events and trends introduction 
we experienced rapid growth during the years ended december  and  which was driven by the continued adoption of the da vinci surgical system for use in urologic  gynecologic  cardiothoracic  and general surgeries 

table of contents financial highlights procedures grew to approximately  procedures performed during the year ended december  total revenue grew to million from million during the year ended december  recurring revenue grew to million from million during the year ended december  instruments and accessories revenue grew to million from million during the year ended december  system revenue grew to million from million during the year ended december  in the fourth quarter  we experienced a slowdown of system sales as customers postponed purchases due to the current economic environment 
this slowdown may affect future system revenue 
revenue per employee grew to approximately  during the year ended december  compared with  during the year ended december  we sold da vinci surgical systems during the year ended december   an increase of compared with for the year ended december  as of december   we had a da vinci surgical system installed base of  systems  in north america  in europe  and in the rest of the world 
operating income increased by to million  or of revenue  during the year ended december  compared to million  or of revenue  during the year ended december  operating income included million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  of stock based compensation expense for the estimated fair value of employee stock programs 
our business continues to demonstrate the ability to generate significant positive cash flow while supporting our rapid business growth 
cash  cash equivalents  and investments increased by million during  including million generated from employee stock programs and million of capital expenditure for land  buildings  intellectual property rights and other items and million used in addition working capital 
we ended fiscal with million in cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
procedure adoption we believe the adoption of da vinci surgery occurs surgical procedure by surgical procedure  and it is being adopted for those procedures which offer significant patient value 
the value of a surgical procedure to a patient is higher if it offers superior clinical outcomes  less surgical trauma  or both 
the procedures that have driven the most growth in our business recently are the da vinci prostatectomy dvp and the da vinci hysterectomy dvh 
dvp procedures grew approximately in and represented more than half of all the da vinci surgical procedures for the year 
dvp is now the leading treatment choice for localized prostate cancer in the united states 
the dvh procedure was a faster growing procedure from a percentage growth standpoint in  growing approximately 
other urologic procedures such as  da vinci nephrectomy  da vinci cystectomy  da vinci pyeloplasty  other gynecologic procedures such as da vinci myomectomy  da vinci sacral colpopexy  cardiothoracic procedures such as da vinci mitral valve repair  da vinci revascularization  and da vinci gastric bypass have also contributed to our growth 
dvp and dvh represented approximately of the procedures performed during and no other procedure represents a significant part of our business at this time 

table of contents new products 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we launched the endowrist grasping retractor 
the endowrist grasping retractor is a multi functional mm instrument to facilitate soft tissue management 
the endowrist grasping retractor is designed with the primary intent of providing an atraumatic  large profile  multi functional instrument for grasping and retracting abdominal viscera and peritoneal tissue in a totally endoscopic environment  in order to obtain the necessary exposure during pelvic and abdominal procedures 
the endowrist grasping retractor is used in procedures such as hysterectomy for cancer with lymphadenectomy  sacral colpopexy  and low anterior resection 
facilities and information technology infrastructure 
we have made investments in facilities and information technology infrastructure to support current and future growth 
during the year ended december   we purchased land and a building of approximately  square feet  in sunnyvale  california 
in addition  we began construction of a  square feet multi use building on the land we purchased in sunnyvale  ca during the year ended december  however  due to the current economic climate  we have delayed construction until at the earliest 
we have also invested in information technology infrastructure to support our growth 
total capital expenditures for were million

table of contents total revenue total revenue increased by  and during the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue increased from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  total revenue growth was driven by the continued adoption of da vinci surgery 
we believe that robotic surgery will be adopted surgical procedure by surgical procedure 
our revenue growth during the periods presented reflects adoption progress made in our target procedures 
dvp has been our most successful procedure to date and has been a significant sales catalyst 
an increasing body of clinical evidence has indicated dvp to offer superior surgical outcomes compared to traditional open prostatectomy in the critical categories of cancer removal  continence  and sexual potency 
from through  dvh has been a much faster growing procedure  at approximately during favorable clinical results have been reported in hysterectomies for cancerous pathology  which include increased lymph node retrieval counts and significant reduction in blood transfusion 
for most patients  a minimally invasive approach using the da vinci surgical system offers reduced pain  less blood loss  shorter hospital stays and a quicker return to normal daily activities 
revenue within the united states accounted for  and of total revenue during the years ended december    and  respectively 
we believe domestic revenue accounts for the large majority of total revenue due largely to the competitive nature of the domestic healthcare market

table of contents instruments and accessories revenue increased to million for the year ended december   up  compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is driven by an increase in procedures performed 
procedure growth occurred in all of our targeted procedures with prostatectomy and hysterectomy being the largest drivers of growth 
utilization per installed system for the year ended december  also increased as compared with the year ended december  for established accounts in  we recognized an average of  to  in instrument and accessory revenue per surgical procedure performed with the da vinci surgical system 
total instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was between  and  reflecting the impact of initial instrument and accessory purchases for newly installed systems 
instrument and accessory pricing remained unchanged from to instrument and accessory revenue per procedure declined during due to three factors 
first  the impact of initial stocking orders decreased as the proportion of new systems sold to the installed base has declined 
secondly  we had a higher mix of procedures that require fewer instruments such as benign dvh procedures 
finally  our customers are becoming more efficient in their use of instruments and accessories as their procedure volumes increase 
we expect these factors to continue to cause a decrease in our ratio of instrument and accessory revenue per procedure in systems revenue increased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  primarily due to the growth in the number of system unit sales reflecting adoption of robotic surgery
