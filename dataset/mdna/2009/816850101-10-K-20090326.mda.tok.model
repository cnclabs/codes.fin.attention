item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
as discussed in forward looking and cautionary statements earlier in this report  this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements  including as a result of the risks described in the cautionary statements in item a risk factors and elsewhere in this form k  in our other filings with the sec  and in material incorporated herein and therein by reference 
we undertake no duty to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
overview we design  produce and market a broad range of products that are sold principally to customers in the high end consumer  industrial  computing and communications end markets 
the high end consumer market includes handheld products  set top boxes  digital televisions  digital video recorders  bluetooth headsets and other consumer equipment 
included in the industrial customer base are automated meter reading  military and aerospace  medical  automated test equipment  security  automotive  home automation  and other industrial equipment 
the computing market includes desktops  servers  notebooks  graphics  printers  and other computer peripherals 
the communications market includes base stations  optical networks  switches and routers  wireless lan  and other communication infrastructure equipment 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers  including alcatel  apple  cisco  compal electronics  dell  hewlett packard  intel  lg electronics  motorola  nokia siemens networks  phonak  quanta computer  research in motion  samsung  sanyo  siemens  and sony 
we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
product design and engineering revenue is recognized during the period in which services are performed 
we defer revenue recognition on shipment of certain products to distributors where return privileges exist until the products are sold through to end users 
gross profit is equal to our net sales less our cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes materials  depreciation on fixed assets used in the manufacturing process  shipping costs  direct labor and overhead 
we determine the cost of inventory by the first in  first out method 
our operating costs and expenses generally consist of selling  general and administrative sg a  product development and engineering costs r d  costs associated with acquisitions  and other operating related charges 
most of our sales to customers are made on the basis of individual customer purchase orders 
many customers include liberal cancellation provisions in their purchase orders 
trends within the industry toward shorter lead times and just in time deliveries have resulted in our reduced ability to predict future shipments 
as a result  we rely on orders received and shipped within the same quarter for a significant portion of our sales 
sales made directly to customers during fiscal year were of net sales 
the remaining of net sales were made through independent distributors 
we divide and operate our business based on two reportable segments standard semiconductor products and rectifier  assembly and other products 
we evaluate segment performance based on net sales and operating income of each segment 
we do not track segment data or evaluate segment performance on additional financial information 
we do not track balance sheet items by individual reportable segments 
as such  there are no separately identifiable segment assets nor are there any separately identifiable statements of income data below operating income 
the standard semiconductor products segment makes up the vast majority of overall sales and includes our power management  protection  advanced communication and sensing product lines 
the rectifier  assembly and other products segment includes our line of assembly and rectifier devices  which are the remaining products from our founding as a supplier into the military and aerospace market 
our business involves reliance on foreign based entities 
most of our outside subcontractors and suppliers  including third party foundries that supply silicon wafers  are located in foreign countries  including china  taiwan  singapore  thailand  malaysia  the philippines  germany  israel and canada 
for the fiscal year ended january   approximately of our silicon  in terms of cost of wafers purchased  was manufactured in china 
foreign sales for fiscal year constituted approximately of our net sales 
approximately of foreign sales in fiscal year were to customers located in the asia pacific region 
the remaining foreign sales were primarily to customers in europe  canada  and mexico 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate and discuss with our audit committee our estimates  including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  inventory reserves  asset impairments and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which together form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
our critical accounting policies and estimates do not vary between our two reportable segments 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements accounting for temporary and long term investments our temporary and long term investments consist of government  bank and corporate obligations 
temporary investments mature within twelve months of the balance sheet date 
long term investments have maturities in excess of one year from the date of the balance sheet 
we classify our investments as available for sale because we expect to possibly sell some securities prior to maturity 
we include any unrealized gain or loss  net of tax  in the comprehensive income portion of our consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
after determining the fair value of our available for sale investments  gains or losses on these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income  until either the investment is sold or we determine that a decline in value is other than temporary 
determining whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each investment 
for investments in debt instruments  these judgments primarily consider the financial condition and liquidity of the issuer  the issuer s credit rating  and any specific events that may cause us to believe that the debt instrument will not mature and be paid in full  and our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity 
if management decides not to hold an investment until maturity  it may result in the recognition of an other than temporary impairment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
if we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance to reduce the net receivable to the amount we reasonably believe we will be able to collect from the customer 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment  the size and number of certain large accounts and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required in the future 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
we defer revenue recognition on shipment of products to certain customers  principally distributors  where return privileges exist until these products are sold through to end users or the return privilege lapses 
the estimated deferred gross margin on these sales  where there are no outstanding receivables  are recorded on the balance sheet under the heading of deferred revenue 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical sales returns and other known factors 
actual returns could be different from our estimates and current provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future charges to earnings 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and consist of materials  labor and overhead 
we determine the cost of inventory by the first in  first out method 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand 
in order to state our inventory at lower of cost or market  we maintain reserves against our inventory 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  a write down of inventory may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
contingencies and litigation we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters as a claimant and as defendant 
we record any amounts recovered in these matters when collection is certain 
we record liabilities for claims against us when the losses are probable and reasonably estimable 
any amounts recorded are based on reviews by outside counsel  in house counsel and management 
actual results may differ from estimates 
stock based compensation in fiscal year  we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including stock options at fair value 
sfas r requires us to apply a valuation model  which includes estimates and assumptions on the rate of forfeiture and expected life of options and stock price volatility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of sfas r 
if any of the assumptions used in the valuation model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period and actual results may differ from estimates 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas  the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if the company believes indicators of impairment exist 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy and the semiconductor industry or iv any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
in the process of our annual impairment review  we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of the assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analysis  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges in a future period 

table of contents the company accounts for other purchased intangible assets  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns in the semiconductor industry  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of an asset is impaired  based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if this comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using i quoted market prices and or ii discounted expected future cash flows utilizing a discount rate consistent with the guidance provided in fasb concepts statement no 
 using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
generally  to the extent we change a valuation allowance  the change is recorded through the tax provision in the statement of operations 
for fiscal year and prior  release of a valuation allowance established against a pre acquisition xemics net operating loss carryforward was recorded to goodwill 
after the required adoption of sfas r business combinations in fiscal year  any release of valuation allowances related to the xemics net operating loss carryforward will be recorded as a reduction to tax expense 
management periodically evaluates our deferred tax assets to assess whether it is likely that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin in the first quarter of fiscal year we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant management estimates are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax impact is uncertain 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
as a result of the adoption of fin in the first quarter of fiscal year  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period of change 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
under sfas r  the income tax effects of share based payments are recognized for financial reporting purposes only if such awards are expected to result in a tax deduction 
sfas r prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset for an excess tax benefit that is  a tax benefit that exceeds the amount of compensation cost recognized for the award for financial reporting purposes that has not been realized 
in determining when an excess tax benefit is realized  we have elected to follow the ordering provision of the tax law 
in addition to the risks to the effective tax rate discussed above  the effective tax rate reflected in forward looking statements is based on current enacted tax law 
significant changes in enacted tax law could materially affect these estimates 
results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales 
net sales for fiscal year were million  an increase of from million for fiscal year while fiscal year revenue grew modestly  revenue during the fourth quarter was million  down percent from the fourth quarter of fiscal year and down percent when compared to the third quarter of fiscal year deteriorating global economic conditions resulted in reduced demand for our customer s end products  which caused a severe reduction in orders of our component products 
demand and orders were further reduced during the fourth quarter as our customers began to work down their inventories  resulting in fewer replacement orders

end markets fiscal years  in thousands january  january  net sales total net sales total change computer communications high end consumer industrial other net sales within the industrial category  higher revenue was driven by increased capacity to service strong demand for our power discrete products targeted at military  medical and other industrial applications 
this strength was partially offset by lower sales in support of the automated test equipment market 
within the high end consumer and the computing groups  higher unit sales of our protection products were offset by lower average selling prices  and weakness in overall demand for power management products

we believe that we have the financial resources necessary to meet business requirements for the next months  including funds needed for working capital requirements 
as of january   our total shareholders equity was million

these favorable factors were 
table of contents partially offset by lower net income  lower tax benefits from stock based compensation  lower accounts payable balances  and lower levels of accrued liabilities 
during fiscal year  approximately million of recovery expenditures were incurred for repairs at our reynosa  mexico manufacturing facility which suffered fire damage in the third quarter of fiscal year these fire related expenditures were partially offset by receipt of related insurance recoveries of during the first quarter of fiscal year  we initiated a restructuring plan within the standard semiconductor products segment to reorganize certain operations  consolidate research and development activities and reduce our workforce 
the reorganization and consolidation were completed in the second quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year  we recorded costs of million for employee severance and other facility consolidation costs  including  of asset write downs and million of cash payments 
restructuring charges are presented separately in operating costs and expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
in order to develop  design and manufacture new products  we have incurred significant expenditures during the past five years 
we intend to continue to focus on those areas that have shown potential for viable and profitable market opportunities  which may require additional investment in equipment and will require continued  and perhaps additional  investment in design and application engineers aimed at developing new products 
certain of these expenditures  particularly the addition of design engineers  do not generate significant payback in the short term 
we plan to finance these expenditures with cash generated by our operations and our existing cash balances 
a meaningful portion of our capital resources  and the liquidity they represent  are held by our foreign subsidiaries 
as of january   the amount held by our foreign subsidiaries was approximately million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments compared to million as of january  if we needed these funds for investment in domestic operations  any repatriation could result in increased tax liabilities 
one of the primary goals of the company is to constantly improve the cash flows from our existing business activities 
as discussed above  we have historically used  and intend to continue to use  cash flow to fund the repurchase of our common stock 
additionally  we will continue to seek to maintain and improve our existing business performance with necessary capital expenditures and  potentially  acquisitions that may further improve our base business with prospects of a proper return 
acquisitions  should we undertake them to improve our business  might be made for either cash or stock consideration  or a combination of both 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments noted above  when combined with lack of any outstanding debt obligations  give us the flexibility to continue to leverage our free cash flow to return value to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases while also pursuing business improvement opportunities 
non cash working capital trade accounts receivable  less valuation allowances  decreased by million to million at january  from million at january  primarily as a result of lower revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year inventories decreased by  to million at january  from million at january  we believe non cash working capital ratios  relative to our revenue and cost of revenue  will remain at levels approximately the same as they currently are 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million net of sale proceeds of  in fiscal year compared to million net of sale proceeds of  in fiscal year the increases in capital expenditures were made to expand our test capacity and support engineering functions  and to support our recovery effort related to the fire at our reynosa  mexico manufacturing facility 
we expect insurance recoveries to cover most of the costs related to our fire recovery effort 
most of the restoration efforts at our reynosa  mexico manufacturing facility are complete 
accordingly  we don t expect to incur any additional significant restoration costs at this facility in fiscal year proceeds from exercises of stock options for fiscal year  cash collected directly from grantee exercises of stock options was million as compared with million in fiscal year we do not directly control the timing of the exercise of vested stock options by our grantees 
such exercises are decisions made by those grantees and are influenced most directly by the level of our stock price and  indirectly  by other considerations of those grantees 
such proceeds are difficult to forecast 
while the level of such cash inflow to us is subject to these factors which we don t control  we believe that such proceeds will remain an important secondary source of cash after cash flow from operations 
stock repurchases we currently have in effect an active stock repurchase program 
this program represents one of our major efforts to return value to our shareholders 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we announced that the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock 
in fiscal year  we repurchased million shares under this program for million 
in addition to the repurchase activity   shares were withheld from vested restricted stock to cover employee payroll and income tax liabilities

they are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as of january   as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property 
we maintain a deferred compensation plan for certain officers and key executives that allows participants to defer a portion of their compensation for future distribution at various times permitted by the plan 
the plan provides for a discretionary company match up to a defined portion of the employee s deferral  with any match subject to a vesting period 
compensation expense under this plan for fiscal years  and totaled approximately  net of  of forfeitures   net of  of forfeitures and  net of  of forfeitures  respectively 
our liability for deferred compensation under this plan was million as of january  and million as of january   and is included in other long term liabilities on the balance sheet and in the table above 
we have purchased whole life insurance on the lives of certain current and former deferred compensation plan participants 
this company owned life insurance is held in a grantor trust and is intended to cover a majority of our costs of the deferred compensation plan 
the cash surrender value of our company owned life insurance was million as of january  and million as of january   and is included in other assets 
in addition to the current accrued taxes for uncertain tax positions reflected in the contractual obligations table above  the company has million of long term fin taxes for uncertain tax positions 
the company expects that any tax increases from audits would be substantially offset by carryforward tax attributes ie  tax credits 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the amounts and timing of possible future cash outflows associated with these fin liabilities  and the likelihood that any tax liability would be substantially offset by utilizing carryforward tax attributes  we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of possible cash settlement 
inflation inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our performance over the past several years

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to a variety of market risks  such as the foreign exchange and interest rate risks that are detailed below 
many of the factors that can impact our market risk are external to the company  and so we are unable to fully predict them 
foreign currency risk as a global enterprise  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and we could experience currency gains or losses 
historically  we have not considered our foreign currency exposure to be material 
therefore  we have not utilized foreign currency hedging products to mitigate foreign currency risks 
our foreign currency exposures may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows 
changes in the rates could have an adverse impact upon our financial results 
certain of our bank accounts and current assets are held in non us dollar currencies 
the non us dollar currencies are principally the swiss franc  euro  mexican peso  and british pound sterling 
additionally  certain of our liabilities are denominated in the swiss franc  euro  mexican peso  and british pound sterling subjecting them to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may result in transaction gains or losses 
all of our foreign sales  which amounted to million in fiscal year  are denominated in united states dollars 
currency exchange rate fluctuations in foreign countries where we do business could harm our business by resulting in pricing that is not competitive with prices denominated in local currencies 
for the fiscal year ended january   approximately million of expenses were settled in british pound sterling  million of expenses were settled in swiss francs  million of expenses were settled in euros and million of expenses were settled in mexican pesos 
in general  we purchase foreign currencies on a spot basis as needed to fund local operations 
as of january   we held cash funds of million denominated in british pound sterling and million denominated in mexican pesos 
we did not hold a material amount of other foreign currencies as of january  if rates of these foreign currencies were to strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar  the company would realize gains or losses in converting these funds back into us dollars 
interest rate and market risk as of january   we had no long term debt outstanding 
we do not currently hedge any potential interest rate exposure 
interest rates affect our return on excess cash and investments 
as of january   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of temporary and long term investments 
a majority of our cash and cash equivalents and investments generate interest income based on prevailing interest rates 
investments and cash and cash equivalents generated interest income of million in fiscal year a significant change in interest rates would impact the amount of interest income generated from our excess cash and investments 
it would also impact the market value of our investments 
our investments are subject to market risks  primarily interest rate and credit risk 
our investments are managed by a limited number of outside professional managers following investment guidelines set by us 
such guidelines include prescribing credit quality  permissible investments  diversification  and duration restrictions 
these restrictions are intended to limit risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term durations 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year  we implemented an investment strategy limiting investment of new funds and maturing securities to us treasury and federal agency securities with the objective of lowering the overall credit risk of the portfolio
