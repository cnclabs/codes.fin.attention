executive overview umpqua s results reflect the effects of the us recession and the significant impact of the housing market downturn 
primarily affecting our northern california and central oregon residential development portfolios  the impact of the economic slowdown resulted in non performing assets increased to million  or of total assets  as of december   compared to million  or of total assets as of december  non performing loans increased to million  or of total loans  as of december   compared to million  or of total loans as of december  impaired collateral dependent loans have been written down to their estimated net realizable values as of december  net charge offs were million in  or of average loans and leases  as compared to net charge offs of million  or of average loans and leases in the write down of impaired loans in the current year has contributed to the increase in net charge offs 
downgrades within the loan portfolio and increases in non performing loans and net charge offs in contributed to a million provision for loan and lease losses in  as compared to million in however  the past year was not without some accomplishments 
during the year  we increased our total risk based capital ratio to as of december   compared to as of december  issued million of new trust preferred securities and a warrant to purchase up to million shares of the company s common stock to the us treasury under the capital purchase program 
the preferred stock bears a stated interest rate of for five years and thereafter  and currently represents a relatively low cost of capital to enhance the capital position of the bank 
this capital will help fund new loan programs and ensure credit is made available to qualifying borrowers 
the government s investment in the company recognizes the strength and stability of umpqua and our good standing as a strong and healthy financial institution 
as a result of the visa inc visa initial public offering  we received million in proceeds from a mandatory partial redemption of our restricted class b common stock 
additionally  in we reversed our fourth quarter visa related litigation reserve of million 
the value of unredeemed class a equivalent shares owned by the company was million as of december   and has not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
we recorded gains of million in the income statement representing the change in fair value on our junior subordinated debentures measured at fair value in  compared to gains of million in the change in fair value recognized in the current period resulted from the widening of credit risk adjusted spreads on potential new issuances and recent reductions in three month libor rates 
we opened a new commercial banking center in san francisco  california and a mortgage office in stockton  california 
additionally  we have remodeled thirty eight stores to meet umpqua brand standards and customer expectations throughout the california region 
these efforts primarily relate to locations acquired through recent acquisitions 

table of contents umpqua holdings corporation also during the year earnings per diluted common share was in  as compared to per diluted share earned in the decline in net income per diluted common share is principally attributed to an increased provision for loan and lease losses  losses incurred on other real estate owned  and interest reversals on loans  resulting from the housing market downturn 
net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased to in from in the decrease in net interest margin resulted from reductions in earning asset yields due primarily to the decline in the prime rate in the current year  offset by a decrease in the cost of interest bearing deposits 
excluding a million reversal of interest income on loans in  the tax equivalent net interest margin would have been 
mortgage banking revenue was million in  compared to million in the results include a million loss on the fair value of the mortgage servicing right msr asset  primarily resulting from lower mortgage interest rates  and a million loss on an ineffective msr hedge due to widening spreads and price declines that were not offset by a corresponding gain in the related msr asset 
net gain on investment securities of million in includes an other than temporary impairment otti charge of million  which primarily relates to non agency collateralized mortgage obligations where the default rates and loss severities of the underlying collateral indicate credit losses are expected to occur 
gross loans and leases increased to billion as of december   an increase of million  or  as compared to december  the growth rate is indicative of the company s controlled loan growth strategy employed in the current year in response to the current economic climate 
total consolidated assets were billion as of december   compared to billion as of december   representing an increase of million or 
the growth in total assets is principally due to the proceeds obtained from the us treasury under the capital purchase plan  which bolsters the company s capital position and enhances our ability to ensure credit is made available to qualifying borrowers 
declared cash dividends of per share in the first  second and third quarters of  and per share in the fourth quarter of the decision to reduce our quarterly dividend was a result of several contributing factors  such as capital preservation  expected growth rates  projected earnings and our overall dividend pay out ratio 
summary of critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
not all of these critical accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
management believes that the following policies would be considered critical under the sec s definition 
allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded commitments the bank performs regular credit reviews of the loan and lease portfolio to determine the credit quality and adherence to underwriting standards 
when loans and leases are originated  they are assigned a risk rating that is reassessed periodically during the term of the loan through the credit review process 
the company s risk rating methodology assigns risk ratings ranging from to  where a higher rating represents higher risk 
the risk rating categories are a primary factor in determining an appropriate amount for the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the bank has a management allowance for loan and lease losses alll committee  which is responsible for  among other things  regularly reviewing the alll 
table of contents methodology  including loss factors  and ensuring that it is designed and applied in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the alll committee reviews and approves loans and leases recommended for impaired status 
the alll committee also approves removing loans and leases from impaired status 
the bank s audit and compliance committee provides board oversight of the alll process and reviews and approves the alll methodology on a quarterly basis 
each risk rating is assessed an inherent credit loss factor that determines the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses provided for that group of loans and leases with similar risk rating 
credit loss factors may vary by region based on management s belief that there may ultimately be different credit loss rates experienced in each region 
regular credit reviews of the portfolio also identify loans that are considered potentially impaired 
potentially impaired loans are referred to the alll committee which reviews and approves designated loans as impaired 
a loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events  we determine that we will probably not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract  including scheduled interest payments 
when we identify a loan as impaired  we measure the impairment using discounted cash flows  except when the sole remaining source of the repayment for the loan is the liquidation of the collateral 
in these cases  we use the current fair value of the collateral  less selling costs  instead of discounted cash flows 
if we determine that the value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  we either recognize an impairment reserve as a specific component to be provided for in the allowance for loan and lease losses or charge off the impaired balance on collateral dependent loans if it is determined that such amount represents a confirmed loss 
the combination of the risk rating based allowance component and the impairment reserve allowance component lead to an allocated allowance for loan and lease losses 
the bank may also maintain an unallocated allowance amount to provide for other credit losses inherent in a loan and lease portfolio that may not have been contemplated in the credit loss factors 
this unallocated amount generally comprises less than of the allowance  but may be maintained at higher levels during times of deteriorating economic conditions characterized by falling real estate values 
the unallocated amount is reviewed periodically based on trends in credit losses  the results of credit reviews and overall economic trends 
the reserve for unfunded commitments ruc is established to absorb inherent losses associated with our commitment to lend funds  such as with a letter or line of credit 
the adequacy of the alll and ruc are monitored on a regular basis and are based on management s evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  loan growth rates  past due and non performing trends  evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  historical charge off and recovery experience  and other pertinent information 
management believes that the alll was adequate as of december  there is  however  no assurance that future loan losses will not exceed the levels provided for in the alll and could possibly result in additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examination of the bank  may require additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses in future periods if warranted as a result of their review 
approximately of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate  and a significant decline in real estate market values may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
over the last two years  there has been deterioration in the residential development market which has led to an increase in non performing loans and the allowance for loan and lease losses 
a continued deterioration in this market or deterioration in other segments of our loan portfolio may lead to additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses 
mortgage servicing rights sfas no 
 issued in march  requires all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities to be initially measured at fair value 
in addition  entities are permitted to choose to either subsequently measure servicing rights at fair value and report changes in fair value in earnings  or amortize servicing rights in proportion to and over the period of the estimated net servicing income or loss and assess the rights for impairment 
beginning with the fiscal year in which an entity adopts sfas no 
 it may elect to subsequently measure a class of servicing assets and liabilities at fair value 
the effect of remeasuring an existing 
table of contents umpqua holdings corporation class of servicing assets and liabilities at fair value is to be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption 
for the company  this standard became effective on january  the company determines its classes of servicing assets based on the asset type being serviced along with the methods used to manage the risk inherent in the servicing assets  which includes the market inputs used to value the servicing assets 
the company elected to measure its residential mortgage servicing assets at fair value subsequent to adoption 
as the retrospective application of sfas no 
is not permitted  there was no change to prior period financial statements 
since there was no difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the mortgage servicing rights msr on the date of adoption  there was also no cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings 
upon the change from the lower of cost or fair value accounting method to fair value accounting under sfas no 
 the calculation of amortization and the assessment of impairment were discontinued and the msr valuation allowance was written off against the recorded value of the msr 
those measurements have been replaced by fair value adjustments that encompass market driven valuation changes and the runoff in value that occurs from the passage of time  which are each separately reported 
under the fair value method  the msr  net  is carried in the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value are reported in earnings under the caption mortgage banking revenue in the period in which the change occurs 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 msr were capitalized at their allocated carrying value and amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated future net servicing income in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the carrying value of msr was evaluated for possible impairment on a quarterly basis in accordance with sfas no 
if an impairment condition existed for a particular valuation tranche  a valuation allowance was established for the excess of amortized cost over the estimated fair value through a charge to mortgage servicing fee revenue 
if  in subsequent periods  the estimated fair value was determined to be in excess of the amortized cost net of the related valuation allowance  the valuation allowance was reduced through a credit to mortgage servicing revenue 
retained mortgage servicing rights are measured at fair values as of the date of sale 
we use quoted market prices when available 
subsequent fair value measurements are determined using a discounted cash flow model 
in order to determine the fair value of the msr  the present value of expected future cash flows is estimated 
assumptions used include market discount rates  anticipated prepayment speeds  delinquency and foreclosure rates  and ancillary fee income 
this model is periodically validated by an independent external model validation group 
the model assumptions and the msr fair value estimates are also compared to observable trades of similar portfolios as well as to msr broker valuations and industry surveys 
the expected life of the loan can vary from management s estimates due to prepayments by borrowers  especially when rates fall 
prepayments in excess of management s estimates would negatively impact the recorded value of the mortgage servicing rights 
the value of the mortgage servicing rights is also dependent upon the discount rate used in the model  which we base on current market rates 
management reviews this rate on an ongoing basis based on current market rates 
a significant increase in the discount rate would reduce the value of mortgage servicing rights 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets at december   we had million in goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of business combinations 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are periodically tested for impairment 
management performs an impairment analysis for the intangible assets with indefinite lives on a quarterly basis 
as a result of this analysis  management determined that there was a million impairment related to the retail brokerage reporting segment as of december   which resulted from the company s evaluation following the departure of certain strand financial advisors 
the valuation of the impairment at the retail brokerage operating segment was determined using an income approach by discounting cash flows of forecasted earnings 
the remaining balance of goodwill and other intangible assets relates to the community banking reporting segment 
the company engaged an independent valuation specialist to assist us in determining whether and to what extent our goodwill asset was impaired 
the valuation of the reporting unit was determined using discounted cash flows of forecasted earnings  estimated sales price multiples based on recent observable market transactions and market capitalization based on current stock price 
the step one impairment test indicated that the reporting 
table of contents unit s fair value was less than its carrying value 
based on the results of the step two impairment test  management determined that the implied fair value of the goodwill was greater than its carrying amount on the company s balance sheet and no goodwill impairment existed as of december  in the community banking segment 
if impairment was deemed to exist  a write down of the asset would occur with a charge to earnings 
the impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  competitive forces  customer behaviors and attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  cost structures  technology  changes in discount rates and specific industry and market conditions 
additional information is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision to the previously issued guidance on accounting for stock options and other forms of equity based compensation  we recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based forms of compensation issued to employees over the employees requisite service period generally the vesting period 
the requisite service period may be subject to performance conditions 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
management assumptions utilized at the time of grant impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes methodology  and ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option 
additional information is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fair value effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which among other things  requires enhanced disclosures about financial instruments carried at fair value 
sfas no 
establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value 
the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the transaction 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the level of pricing transparency associated with financial instruments carried at fair value

furthermore  acquisition related and other costs will now be expensed rather than treated as cost components of the acquisition 
sfas no

results of operations overview for the year ended december   net income available to common shareholders was million  or per diluted share  a decrease of on a per diluted share basis compared to the decrease in net income available to common shareholders in is principally attributable to increased provision for loan and lease losses  partially offset by increased net interest and non interest income  and decreased non interest expense 
we completed the acquisition of north bay bancorp on april   and the results of the acquired operations are only included in our financial results starting on april  
table of contents for the year ended december   net income available to common shareholders was million  or per diluted share  a decrease of on a per diluted share basis compared to the decrease in net income available to common shareholders in is principally attributable to increased provision for loan and lease losses and operating expenses  partially offset by increased net interest and non interest income 
we completed the acquisition of western sierra bancorp on june   and the results of the acquired operations are only included in our financial results starting on june  we incur significant expenses related to the completion and integration of mergers 
additionally  we may recognize goodwill impairment losses that have no effect on the company s or the bank s cash balances  liquidity  or regulatory capital ratios 
accordingly  we believe that our operating results are best measured on a comparative basis excluding the impact of merger related expenses  net of tax  and other charges related to business combinations 
we define operating income as income available to common shareholders before merger related expenses  net of tax  and goodwill impairment  and we calculate operating income per diluted share by dividing operating income by the same diluted share total used in determining diluted earnings per share see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
operating income and operating income per diluted share are considered non gaap financial measures 
although we believe the presentation of non gaap financial measures provides a better indication of our operating performance  readers of this report are urged to review the gaap results as presented in the financial statements and supplementary data in item below 
the following table presents a reconciliation of operating income and operating income per diluted share to net income and net income per diluted share for years ended december   and reconciliation of operating income to net income available to common shareholders years ended december  in thousands  except per share data net income available to common shareholders merger related expenses  net of tax goodwill impairment operating income per diluted share net income merger related expenses  net of tax  and goodwill impairment operating income the following table presents the returns on average assets  average common shareholders equity and average tangible common shareholders equity for the years ended december   and for each of the years presented  the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net income available to common shareholders and operating income as shown in the table above 
our return on average common shareholders equity is negatively impacted as a result of capital required to support goodwill 
to the extent this performance metric is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger related intangible assets  we believe it beneficial to also consider the return on average common tangible shareholders equity 
the return on average common tangible shareholders equity is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by average common shareholders equity less average intangible assets 
the return on average tangible common shareholders equity is considered a non gaap financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with the return on average common shareholders equity

net interest income for was negatively impacted by the million reversal of interest income on loans during the year 
the increase in net interest income in as compared to and as compared to is attributable to growth in outstanding average interest earning assets  primarily loans and leases and investment securities  partially offset by both growth in interest bearing liabilities  primarily money market  time deposits and term debt  and a decrease in net interest margin 
in addition to organic growth  the north bay merger  which was completed on april   contributed to the increase in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in over the fair value of interest earning assets acquired as a result of the north bay merger totaled million  and interest bearing liabilities totaled million 
the net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets on a fully tax equivalent basis was for  a decrease of basis points as compared to the same period in the decrease in net interest margin in resulted from decreases in market index rates  such as prime and the fed funds rates  and interest reversals on loans 
the decreased yield on interest earning assets of basis points in primarily resulted from reductions in the prime rate 
this decline in net interest margin was partially offset by the decrease in our interest expense to earning assets of basis points from the lower costs of interest bearing deposits 
the million reversal of interest income on loans in contributed to a basis point decline in the tax equivalent net interest margin for the year 
the net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis was for  a decrease of basis points as compared to the same period in the decrease in net interest margin in resulted from volatility in short term market rates and the competitive climate characterized by increasing deposit costs combined with declining interest earning asset yields  as well as interest reversals on new nonaccrual loans 
the million reversal of interest income on loans in contributed to an basis point decline in the tax equivalent net interest margin for our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as changes in the yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds

provision for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses was million for  compared to million for and million for as a percentage of average outstanding loans  the provision for loan losses recorded for was  an increase of basis points and basis points from and  respectively 
the increase in the provision for loan and lease losses in as compared to and is principally attributable to an increase in non performing loans and leases and downgrades within the portfolio related primarily to the housing market downturn and its impact on our residential development portfolio  growth in the loan and lease portfolio  and the increase in loans charged off 
prior to the second quarter of  the company recognized the charge off of an impairment reserve when the loan was resolved  sold  or foreclosed and transferred to other real estate owned 
due to declining real estate values in our markets  it is increasingly likely that an impairment reserve on collateral dependent real estate loans represents a confirmed loss 
as a result  in the second quarter of  the company began recognizing the charge off of impairment reserves on impaired loans in the period it arises for collateral dependent loans 
therefore  the non accrual loans of million as of december  have already been written down to their estimated fair value  less estimated costs to sale  and are expected to be resolved over the 
table of contents coming quarters with no additional material loss 
depending on the characteristics of a loan  the fair value of collateral is estimated by obtaining external appraisals 
the provision for loan and lease losses is based on management s evaluation of inherent risks in the loan portfolio and a corresponding analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
additional discussion on loan quality and the allowance for loan and lease losses is provided under the heading asset quality and non performing assets below

brokerage commissions and fees declined as a result of deteriorating conditions in the trading market during and the departure of certain strand investment advisors  as compared to the decrease in mortgage banking revenue in compared to primarily resulted from the difference between the million loss and  loss on the msr asset between the respective periods  and the million realized loss on an ineffective msr hedge due to significant market volatility in the first quarter of  partially offset by increased fees on loans sold 
in  the company realized a million gain on sale of investment securities as part of a repositioning of the investment portfolio to reduce the weighted average life in response to the current economic outlook  and other factors 
this gain was offset by a million otti charge recognized during additional discussion on the otti charges are provided under the heading investment securities below 
the slowdown in the housing industry in  which has affected our residential development portfolio  has led to an increase of foreclosures into other real estate owned on residential development related properties 
declines in the market values of these properties after foreclosure have resulted in additional losses on the sale of the properties or by valuation adjustments 
during  the company recognized losses on sale of other real estate owned of million and valuation adjustments of million 
the gain on junior subordinated debentures carried at fair value in resulted from the continued widening of credit spreads for potential new issuances over the contractual spread of each junior subordinated debenture measured at fair value  and reductions in the current three month libor rate relative to the prior year 
additional information on the junior subordinated debentures carried at fair value is included in note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
other income decreased in over largely due to decreased gains and broker fee income related to small business administration sba loan sales  and losses related to trading assets 

table of contents umpqua holdings corporation in the first quarter of  visa completed restructuring transactions in preparation for an initial public offering of its class a stock 
as part of those transactions  umpqua bank s membership interest was exchanged for  shares of class b common stock in visa 
in march  visa completed its initial public offering 
following the initial public offering  the company received million proceeds as a mandatory partial redemption of  shares  reducing the company s holdings from  shares to  shares of class b common stock 
a conversion ratio of was established for the conversion rate of class b shares into class a shares 
using the proceeds from this offering  visa also established a billion escrow account to cover settlements  the resolution of pending litigation and related claims covered litigation 
in december  visa deposited additional funds into the escrow account to cover a shortfall in the escrow account caused by a new settlement 
the deposit of funds into the escrow account further reduced the conversion ratio applicable to class b common stock outstanding from per class a share to per class a share 
the company s remaining  shares of visa class b common stock are restricted and may not be transferred until the later of three years from the date of the initial public offering or the period of time necessary to resolve the covered litigation 
if the funds in the escrow account are insufficient to settle all the covered litigation  visa may sell additional class a shares  use the proceeds to settle litigation  and further reduce the conversion ratio 
if funds remain in the escrow account after all litigation is settled  the class b conversion ratio will be increased to reflect that surplus 
as of december   the value of the class a shares was per share 
the value of unredeemed class a equivalent shares owned by the company was million as of december   and has not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
the increase in deposit service charges in over is principally attributable to the increased volume of deposit accounts 
the increase in brokerage commissions and fees in over resulted from management s efforts to recruit new brokers  increase the weighting of managed fee sources and increase efficiencies in back room operations

table of contents excluding the impact of fdic assessments and visa related litigation accruals  non interest expense in over was relatively flat and is attributable to the company s extensive cost control measures that were put in place in in reaction to the slowing economy 
excluding similar fdic assessments and visa related litigation accruals in  the increase in non interest expense in over is primarily attributable to the inclusion of additional expenses from california operations as a result of the north bay and western sierra acquisitions 
the increase in total salaries and employee benefits expense in the current year is primarily a result of reduced loan origination activity  resulting in a reduced offset to compensation expense for deferred loan costs 
excluding the impact of the reduced deferred loan costs  salaries and employee benefits expense decreased million in compared to despite the addition of approximately associates from the north bay acquisition in april the increase in salaries and employee benefits expense in compared to is a result of the north bay acquisition and the addition of approximately associates in june due to the western sierra acquisition

fdic assessments represent premiums payable to the fdic for deposit insurance and financing corporation fico assessments 
in  no deposit insurance premiums were assessed 
the federal deposit insurance reform act of reform act created a new system and rate schedule related to fdic deposit insurance assessments effective in as a result  the company was assessed deposit insurance premiums beginning in  however  most of the premium was offset by a one time assessment credit that was provided to eligible institutions as part of the reform act 
the one time deposit insurance assessment credit was fully exhausted in the increase in fdic assessments in compared to prior years is a result of increased deposit insurance assessments rates and no remaining one time assessment credits available to offset the current period expense 
in october of  the fdic proposed a rule that would further amend the system for risk based deposit insurance assessments and change assessment rates in attempts to restore the deposit insurance fund to targeted reserve ratios 
if passed  this ruling will increase the fdic insurance assessment rates applicable in additional discussion on fdic insurance assessments is provided in item business above  under the heading federal deposit insurance 
the decrease in intangible amortization in as compared to the prior years is due to the run off of intangible assets that are being amortized on an accelerated basis

we also incur significant expenses in connection with the completion and integration of bank acquisitions that are not capitalizable 
classification of expenses as merger related is done in accordance with the provisions of a board approved policy 
the decrease in merger related expenses in over and over is due to the difference in timing and size of the western sierra and north bay mergers 

table of contents umpqua holdings corporation the company incurred no merger related expenses in the following table presents the merger related expenses by major category for the years ended december  and the merger related expenses incurred in primarily related to the north bay acquisition

in addition  visa notified us that it had established a contingency reserve related to unsettled litigation with discover card 
in connection with this contingency  we recorded a liability and corresponding expense of million pre tax  for our proportionate share of that contingent liability 
we are not a party to the visa litigation and our liability arises solely from the bank s membership interest in visa  inc in connection with the completion of visa s initial public offering in the first quarter of  visa utilized a portion of the proceeds to establish a billion litigation escrow account

trading securities consist of securities held in inventory by strand for sale to its clients and securities invested in trust for the benefit of former employees of acquired institutions as required by agreements 
trading securities were million at december   as compared to million at december  this decrease is principally attributable to a decrease trading assets invested for the benefit of former employees  due to distributions and decreases in the fair market value of investment securities therein  partially offset by an increase in strand s inventory of trading securities 
investment securities available for sale were billion as of december   as compared to billion at december  this increase is principally attributable to purchases of million of investment securities available for sale and an increase in fair value of investment securities available for sale of million  offset by the proceeds from the sales and maturities of million of investment securities available for sale of which million represents net gains on sale  the transfer of million of investment securities available for sale at par fair value of million on transfer date to investment securities held to maturity  and amortization of net purchase price premiums of million 
investment securities held to maturity were million as of december   as compared to million at december  this increase is principally attributable to the transfer of million of investment securities available for sale to investment securities held to maturity  offset by paydowns and maturities of investment securities held to maturity of million and otti charges of million

the mortgage related securities in serial maturities in the table above include both pooled mortgage backed issues and high quality collaterized mortgage obligation structures  with an average duration of years 
these mortgage related securities provide yield spread to us treasury or agency securities  however  the cash flows arising from them can be volatile due to refinancing of the underlying mortgage loans 
the equity security in other investment securities in the table above at december  principally represents an investment in a community reinvestment act investment fund comprised largely of mortgage related securities  although funds may also invest in municipal bonds  money market accounts or asset backed securities 
during the third quarter of  the bank initiated a redemption in kind of shares owned in an intermediate mortgage fund  and received its proportionate share of the underlying securities within the fund

the carrying value of the equity interest in the mortgage fund was allocated to the individual securities 
no gain or loss was realized as a result of the redemption 

table of contents as part of this redemption in kind  the company assessed the classification of the underlying securities acquired and elected to classify million in non agency mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations at fair value as investment securities held to maturity 
the company considers the held to maturity classification to be more appropriate because it has the ability and the intent to hold these securities to maturity 
the book value of the securities was recorded at fair value as of the date of the transfer  resulting in a discount to par 
this discount is being accreted to interest income over the remaining terms of the securities 
the related unrealized pretax loss of million included in other comprehensive income as of the date of the transfer remains in other comprehensive income and is being amortized as a yield adjustment through earnings over the remaining term of the securities  and will offset the accretion of the discount 
no gain or loss was recognized at the time of the classification

charges of million related to seven non agency collateralized mortgage obligations carried as held to maturity and where the default rates and loss severities of the underlying collateral indicate credit losses are expected to occur 
these securities were valued by third party pricing services using matrix or model pricing methodologies  and were corroborated by broker indicative bids 
the remaining non agency securities within mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations carried as held to maturity were specifically evaluated for otti  and the default rates and loss severities of the underlying collateral indicated that credit losses are not expected to occur 
in addition  the company recorded an otti charge of  related to a collateralized debt obligation that holds trust preferred securities in investments available for sale where default and deferrals on the underlying debt indicate credit losses are expected to occur within the security 
an additional  charge was recognized in the quarter for preferred stock carried as an investment held to maturity 
these securities were valued by third party pricing services using matrix or model pricing methodologies 
there were no similar charges recorded in or gross unrealized loss in the available for sale investment portfolio was million at december  this consisted primarily of unrealized loss on mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations of million  unrealized loss on obligations of states and political subdivisions of million  and unrealized loss on other debt securities of  it is expected that these securities will not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment 
because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates or other market conditions and not credit quality  and because the bank has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a market price recovery or to maturity  the unrealized losses on these investments are not considered other than temporarily impaired

allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded commitments the allowance for loan and lease losses alll totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses as of december  is principally attributable to an increase in provision for loan and lease losses in excess of charge offs 
the following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses allowance for loan and lease losses composition as of december  in thousands commercial real estate loans to individuals and overdrafts unallocated allowance for loan and lease losses the unallocated portion of alll provides for coverage of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio but not captured in the credit loss factors that are utilized in the risk rating based component  or in the specific impairment reserve component of the allowance for loan and lease losses  and acknowledges the inherent imprecision of all loss prediction models 
the increase in unallocated alll in the current year reflects management s evaluation of the existing general business and economic conditions  and declining credit quality and collateral value trends in the residential housing segment 
the alll composition should not be interpreted as an indication of specific amounts or loan categories in which future charge offs may occur

the significant slowdown in the housing industry  which has affected our residential development portfolio  has resulted in downgrades within the portfolio  an increase in non performing loans  and an increase in loans charged off during the year 
downgrades within the portfolio have increased our classified credit balances resulting in a higher risk rating based component of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
non performing loans have increased due to the identification of impaired loans that have been placed on non accrual status 
all non accrual loans are individually evaluated for impairment 
prior to the second quarter of  the company would establish reserves within the allowance for loan and leases losses for these impairments and would recognize the charge off of an impairment reserve when the loan was resolved  sold  or foreclosed and transferred to other real estate owned 
due to declining real estate values in our markets  it is increasingly likely that an impairment reserve on collateral dependent real estate loans represent a confirmed loss 
as a result  beginning in the second quarter of  the company began recognizing the charge off of impairment reserves on impaired loans in the period it arises for collateral dependent loans 
this process has increased the amount of charge offs recognized in of the million in charge offs year to date  million are residential development related

this assessment  based in part on historical levels of net charge offs  loan growth  and a detailed review of the quality of the loan portfolio  involves uncertainty and judgment  therefore  the adequacy of the alll and ruc cannot be determined with precision and may be subject to change in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examination of the bank  may require additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses in future periods if warranted as a result of their review 
mortgage servicing rights the following table presents the key elements of our mortgage servicing rights asset as of december   and summary of mortgage servicing rights years ended december  dollars in thousands balance  beginning of year additions for new mortgage servicing rights capitalized changes in fair value due to changes in model inputs or assumptions other amortization of servicing rights impairment charge balance  end of year balance of loans serviced for others msr as a percentage of serviced loans represents fair value as of december  and and amortized cost as of december  the fair value as of december  was million 
principally reflects changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions  which are primarily affected by changes in interest rates 
represents changes due to collection realization of expected cash flows over time 
as of december   we serviced residential mortgage loans for others with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million for which servicing assets have been recorded 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
on january   the servicing asset recorded at the time of sale was amortized over the term of  and in proportion to  net servicing revenues 

table of contents subsequent to adoption  the mortgage servicing rights are adjusted to fair value quarterly with the change recorded in mortgage banking revenue 
the value of mortgage servicing rights is impacted by market rates for mortgage loans 
historically low market rates can cause prepayments to increase as a result of refinancing activity 
to the extent loans are prepaid sooner than estimated at the time servicing assets are originally recorded  it is possible that certain mortgage servicing rights assets may decrease in value 
generally  the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights will increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall 
in the fourth quarter of  the company began using derivative instruments to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of msr due to changes in interest rates 
starting in late february and continuing into march  the bond markets experienced extraordinary volatility 
this volatility resulted in widening spreads and price declines on the derivative instruments that were not offset by corresponding gains in the msr asset 
as a result  a million charge was recognized within mortgage banking revenue in the first quarter of in march  the company suspended the msr hedge  given the continued volatility 
goodwill and other intangible assets at december   we had goodwill and other intangible assets of million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million  respectively  at year end intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their respective estimated useful lives  and are also reviewed for impairment 
the decrease to other intangible assets is a result of scheduled amortization 
we amortize other intangible assets on an accelerated or straight line basis over an estimated ten to fifteen year life 
no impairment losses separate from the scheduled amortization have been recognized in connection with other intangible assets since their initial recognition 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are periodically tested for impairment 
management performs a goodwill impairment analysis on a quarterly basis 
this impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit eg retail brokerage and community banking to its carrying value 
if the reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value  the company would be required to proceed to the second step 
in the second step the company calculates the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill recognized in a business combination 
the estimated fair value of the company is allocated to all of the company s assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized identifiable intangible assets  as if the company had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is the price paid to acquire it 
the allocation process is performed only for purposes of determining the amount of goodwill impairment 
no assets or liabilities are written up or down  nor are any additional unrecognized identifiable intangible assets recorded as a part of this process 
any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings in an amount equal to that excess 
the decrease in goodwill in the current year is principally attributable to a million impairment loss relating to the retail brokerage operating segment 
this charge resulted from the company s evaluation following the departure of certain strand financial advisors 
the valuation of the impairment at the retail brokerage operating segment was determined using an income approach by discounting cash flows of forecasted earnings 
the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit include earnings forecasts for five years  a terminal value based on expected future growth rates  and a discount rate reflective of current market conditions 
the ending carrying value of the retail brokerage segment s goodwill was million as of december  the remaining balance of goodwill is associated with our community banking operating segment 
management utilizes a variety of valuation techniques to analyze and measure the estimated fair value of reporting units under both the income and market valuation approach 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by projecting future earnings for five years  utilizing a terminal value based on expected future growth rates  and applying a discount rate reflective of current market conditions 
the estimation of forecasted earning uses management s best estimates of economic and market 
table of contents umpqua holdings corporation conditions over the projected periods and considers estimated growth rates in loans and deposits and future expected changes in net interest margins 
various market based valuation approaches are utilized and include applying market price to earnings  core deposit premium  and tangible book value multiples as observed from relevant  comparable peer companies of the reporting unit 
management also valued the reporting unit by applying an estimated control premium to the market capitalization as of december  weightings are assigned to each of the aforementioned model results  judgmentally allocated based on the observability and reliability of the inputs  to arrive at a final fair value estimate of the reporting unit 
to validate management s assumptions and models  the company engaged an independent valuation specialist to assist us in determining whether and to what extent our goodwill asset was impaired 
the specialist utilized similar valuation techniques as explained above to value the fair value of the reporting unit 
both the company s and valuation specialist s step one impairment test results indicated that the reporting unit s fair value was less than its carrying value 
the external valuation specialist assisted management s analysis under step two of the goodwill impairment test 
under this approach  the specialist calculated the fair value for its unrecognized identifiable intangible assets  such as the core deposit intangible and trade name  as well as the remaining assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
fair value adjustments to items on the balance sheet primarily related to investment securities held to maturity  loans  other real estate owned  deferred taxes  deposits  term debt  and junior subordinated debentures 
the most significant adjustment made was to adjust the carrying value of the company s loans receivable portfolio to fair value 
the loan portfolio was stratified into sixty eight loan pools that shared common characteristics  namely loan type  payment terms  and whether the loans were performing or non performing 
each loan pool was discounted at a rate that considers current market interest rates  credit risk  and assumed liquidity premiums required based upon the nature of the underlying pool 
due to the disruption in the financial markets experience during the year  the liquidity premium reflects the reduction in demand in the secondary markets for all grades of non conforming credit  including those that are performing 
liquidity premiums for individual loan categories generally ranged from for performing loans to for construction and non performing loans 
based on the results of the step two impairment test  management determined that the implied fair value of the goodwill was greater than its carrying amount on the company s balance sheet and no goodwill impairment existed as of december  in the community banking segment 
there were no other impairments on goodwill or other intangible assets at any reporting unit for the years ended december  or if the company s common stock price declines or continues to trade below book value per common share  or should general economic conditions deteriorate further or remain depressed for a prolonged period of time  particularly in the financial industry  the company may be required to recognize an impairment of all  or some portion of  its goodwill 
it is possible that changes in circumstances  existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future  or changes in the numerous estimates associated with management s judgments  assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of our goodwill  such as valuation multiples  discount rates  or projected earnings  could result in an impairment charge in future periods 
impairment charges  if any  may be material to the company s results of operations and financial position 
however  any potential future impairment charge will have no effect on the company s or the bank s cash balances  liquidity  or regulatory capital ratios 
the inputs management utilizes to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit in step one of the goodwill impairment test  and estimating the fair values of the underlying assets and liabilities of a reporting unit in the second step of the goodwill impairment test  may require management to make significant judgments  assumptions and estimates where observable market may not readily exist 
such inputs include  but are not limited to  trading multiples from comparable transactions  control premiums  the value that may arise from synergies and other benefits that would accrue from control over an entity  and the appropriate rates to discount projected cash flows 
additionally  there may be limited current market inputs to value certain assets or liabilities  particularly loans and junior subordinated debentures 
these valuation inputs are considered to be level inputs 
additional information regarding our estimate of fair value for financial instruments and other disclosures relating to fair value measurements is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
management will continue to monitor the relationship of the company s market capitalization to both its book value and tangible book value  which management attributes to both financial services industry wide and company specific factors  and to

borrowings at december   the bank had outstanding million of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and no outstanding federal funds purchased balances 
additional information regarding securities sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased is provided in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 

table of contents umpqua holdings corporation at december   the bank had outstanding term debt of million primarily with the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the million increase in fhlb advances and million increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase were offset in part by the million decrease in federal funds purchased 
advances from the fhlb amounted to million of the total and are secured by investment securities and residential mortgage loans 
the fhlb advances outstanding at december  had fixed interest rates ranging from to and million  or  mature prior to december   while another million  or  mature prior to december  management expects continued use of fhlb advances as a source of short and long term funding 
additional information regarding term debt is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
junior subordinated debentures we had junior subordinated debentures with carrying values of million and million  respectively  at december  and at december   approximately million  or of the total issued amount  had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over libor 
interest expense for junior subordinated debentures decreased in as compared to  primarily resulting from decreases in short term market interest rates and libor 
interest expense for junior subordinated debentures increased in over this increase in expense resulted from the issuance of million of junior subordinated debentures in the second half of partially offset by decreases in short term market interest rates and libor 
although increases in short term market interest rates will increase the interest expense for junior subordinated debentures  we believe that other attributes of our balance sheet will serve to mitigate the impact to net interest income on a consolidated basis 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
allowing us to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
umpqua selected the fair value measurement option for certain pre existing junior subordinated debentures of million the umpqua statutory trusts as of the adoption date 
the remaining junior subordinated debentures as of the adoption date were acquired through business combinations and were measured at fair value at the time of acquisition 
in the company issued two series of trust preferred securities and elected to measure each instrument at fair value 
accounting for junior subordinated debentures originally issued by the company at fair value enables us to more closely align our financial performance with the economic value of those liabilities 
additionally  we believe it improves our ability to manage the market and interest rate risks associated with the junior subordinated debentures 
the junior subordinated debentures measured at fair value and amortized cost have been presented as separate line items on the balance sheet 
the fair value of junior subordinated debentures is estimated using a discounted cash flow model 
the future cash flows of these instruments are extended to the next available redemption date or maturity date as appropriate based upon the spreads of recent issuances or quotes from brokers for comparable bank holding companies compared to the contractual spread of each junior subordinated debenture measured at fair value 
the significant inputs utilized in the estimation of fair value of these instruments is the credit risk adjusted spread and three month libor 
generally  an increase in the credit risk adjusted spread and or a decrease in the three month libor will result in positive fair value adjustments 
conversely  a decrease in the credit risk adjusted spread and or an increase in the three month libor will result in positive fair value adjustments 
for additional assurance  we obtained valuations from a third party pricing service to validate the results of our model 
prior to the third quarter of  we utilized a credit risk adjusted spread that was based upon recent issuances or quotes from brokers for comparable bank holding companies as of the date of valuation  and we considered this to be a level input 
due to the increasing and credit concerns in the capital markets and inactivity in the trust preferred markets that have limited the observability of market spreads  we have classified this as a level fair value measure in the third quarter of the current year 
management believes that the credit risk adjusted spread utilized is still indicative of those that would be used by market participants

liquidity and cash flow the principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the bank s ability to meet the day to day cash flow requirements of our customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs 
we monitor the sources and uses of funds on a daily basis to maintain an acceptable liquidity position 
in addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities  the bank can utilize established uncommitted federal funds lines of credit  sell securities under agreements to repurchase  borrow on a secured basis from the fhlb or issue brokered certificates of deposit 
the bank had available lines of credit with the fhlb totaling billion at december  subject to certain collateral requirements  namely the amount of pledged loans and investment securities 
the bank had uncommitted federal funds line of credit agreements with additional financial institutions totaling million at december  availability of the lines is subject to federal funds balances available for loan and continued borrower eligibility 
these lines are intended to support short term liquidity needs  and the agreements may restrict the consecutive day usage 
the company is a separate entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
substantially all of the company s revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the bank 
in  the bank paid the company million in dividends to fund regular operations 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company 
we believe that such restrictions will not have an adverse impact on the ability of the company to fund its quarterly cash dividend distributions to shareholders  when approved  and meet its ongoing cash obligations  which consist principally of debt service on the million issued amount of outstanding junior subordinated debentures 
as of december   the company did not have any borrowing arrangements of its own 
additional discussion related to liquidity related risks given the current economic climate is provided in item a risk factors above 
as disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows in item of this report  net cash provided by operating activities was million during the principal source of cash provided by operating activities was net income 
the difference between cash provided by operating activities and net income largely consisted of non cash items including a million provision for loan and lease losses  partially offset by the million gain on junior subordinated debentures carried at fair value 
net cash of million used in investing activities consisted principally of million of net loan growth and purchases of investment securities available for sale of million  offset by proceeds from investment securities of million 
the million of cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of million increase in term debt borrowings  million increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and million from the issuance of preferred stock and warrants to the us treasury under the capital purchase plan  offset by a million decrease in federal funds purchased  repayment of million in term debt borrowings  and million in dividend payments

capital resources shareholders equity at december  was billion  an increase of million  or  from december  the increase in shareholders equity during was principally due to the issuance of million of preferred stock and detachable warrants to the us treasury pursuant to umpqua s participation in the cpp  common shares issued in connection with stock plans and related tax benefit of million  unrealized gains on investment securities of million  and retention of million  or approximately  of net income for the year 
the federal reserve board has in place guidelines for risk based capital requirements applicable to us banks and bank financial holding companies 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulation  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers  which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
the guidelines require an total risk based capital ratio  of which must be tier i capital 
our consolidated tier i capital  which consists of shareholders equity and qualifying trust preferred securities  less other comprehensive income  goodwill  other intangible assets  disallowed servicing assets and disallowed deferred tax assets  totaled million at december  tier ii capital components include all  or a portion of  the allowance for loan and lease losses and the portion of trust preferred securities in excess of tier i statutory limits 
the total of tier i capital plus tier ii capital components is referred to as total risk based capital  and was billion at december  the percentage ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were and for tier i and total risk based capital  respectively  at december  
table of contents a minimum leverage ratio is required in addition to the risk based capital standards and is defined as period end shareholders equity and qualifying trust preferred securities  less other comprehensive income  goodwill and deposit based intangibles  divided by average assets as adjusted for goodwill and other intangible assets 
although a minimum leverage ratio of is required for the highest rated financial holding companies that are not undertaking significant expansion programs  the federal reserve board may require a financial holding company to maintain a leverage ratio greater than if it is experiencing or anticipating significant growth or is operating with less than well diversified risks in the opinion of the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board uses the leverage and risk based capital ratios to assess capital adequacy of banks and financial holding companies 
our consolidated leverage ratios at december  and were  and  respectively 
as of december   the most recent notification from the fdic categorized the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
there are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the bank s regulatory capital category 
at december   all three of the capital ratios of the bank exceeded the minimum ratios required by federal regulation 
management monitors these ratios on a regular basis to ensure that the bank remains within regulatory guidelines 
further information regarding the actual and required capital ratios is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
during the first  second and third quarters of  umpqua s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share

the payment of cash dividends is subject to regulatory limitations as described under the supervision and regulation section of part i of this report 
on november   we issued  shares of our fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a  with an aggregate liquidation preference of million  or  per share  to the united state department of the treasury us treasury pursuant to the tarp capital purchase program 
the preferred stock will bear cumulative dividends at a rate of per annum for the first five years and per annum thereafter  in each case  applied to the  per share liquidation preference  but will only be paid when  as and if declared by the company s board of directors out of funds legally available therefor 
dividend payments are payable quarterly in arrears on the th day of february  may  august and november of each year 
in connection with the issuance and sale of the preferred stock  the company entered into a letter agreement including the securities purchase agreement standard terms the agreement with the us treasury 
the agreement contains certain limitations on the payment of quarterly cash dividends on the company s common stock in excess of per share  and on the company s ability to repurchase its common stock 
the preferred stock has no maturity date and ranks senior to our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of amounts payable upon liquidation  dissolution and winding up of the company

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant impact on our profitability 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates to achieve our overall financial objectives 
based on economic conditions  asset quality and various other considerations  management establishes tolerance ranges for interest rate sensitivity and manages within these ranges 
net interest income and the fair value of financial instruments are greatly influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
we manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies that are established by the asset liability management committee alco 
the alco meets monthly and has responsibility for developing asset liability management policy  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings and reviewing interest rate sensitivity 
the board of directors loan and investment committee provides oversight of the asset liability management process  reviews the results of the interest rate risk analyses prepared for the alco and approves the asset liability policy on an annual basis 
management utilizes an interest rate simulation model to estimate the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
such estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity during the life of the instruments 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during periods of changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable timeframe  thereby minimizing the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities at a point in time that are subject to repricing at various time horizons immediate to three months  four to twelve months  one to five years  over five years  and on a cumulative basis 
the differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps 
the table below sets forth interest sensitivity gaps for these different intervals as of december  
table of contents umpqua holdings corporation interest sensitivity gap dollars in thousands by repricing interval non rate sensitive total months months years over years assets temporary investments trading account assets securities available for sale securities held to maturity loans and loans held for sale non interest earning assets total assets liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing demand deposits savings and money market deposits time deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase federal funds purchased term debt junior subordinated debentures non interest bearing liabilities and shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative gap as a of earning assets changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly  while the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same  thus impacting net interest income 
this characteristic is referred to as basis risk and generally relates to the possibility that the repricing characteristics of short term assets tied to the prime rate are different from those of short term funding sources such as certificates of deposit 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities that are not reflected in the interest rate sensitivity analysis 
these prepayments may have a significant impact on our net interest margin 
because of these factors  an interest sensitivity gap analysis may not provide an accurate assessment of our exposure to changes in interest rates 
we utilize an interest rate simulation model to monitor and evaluate the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income 
the estimated impact on our net interest income over a time horizon of one year as of december  is indicated in the table below 
for the scenarios shown  the interest rate simulation assumes a parallel and sustained shift in market interest rates ratably over a twelve month period and no change in the composition or size of the balance sheet 
for example  the up basis points scenario is based on a theoretical increase in market rates of basis points per month for twelve months applied to the balance sheet of december for each respective year 

table of contents interest rate simulation impact on net interest income as of december  dollars in thousands increase decrease in net interest income from base scenario percentage change increase decrease in net interest income from base scenario percentage change increase decrease in net interest income from base scenario percentage change up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points at december   we were liability sensitive in three of four scenarios 
however  our overall sensitivity in all four scenarios has decreased as compared to prior years indicating a more neutral interest risk position 
as of december   we believe our balance sheet was in a liability sensitive position  as the repricing characteristics were such that an increase in market interest rates would have a negative effect on net interest income and a decrease in market interest rates would have positive effect on net interest income 
at december   we were liability sensitive in three of four scenarios 
in an increased market interest rate scenario  our liability sensitivity has increased from prior years 
some of the assumptions made in the simulation model may not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances will occur 
in addition  the simulation model does not take into account any future actions which we could undertake to mitigate an adverse impact due to changes in interest rates from those expected  in the actual level of market interest rates or competitive influences on our deposit base 
a second interest rate sensitivity measure we utilize is the quantification of market value changes for all financial assets and liabilities  given an increase or decrease in market interest rates 
this approach provides a longer term view of interest rate risk  capturing all future expected cash flows 
assets and liabilities with option characteristics are measured based on different interest rate path valuations using statistical rate simulation techniques 
the table below illustrates the effects of various market interest rate changes on the fair values of financial assets and liabilities excluding mortgage servicing rights as compared to the corresponding carrying values and fair values interest rate simulation impact on fair value of financial assets and liabilities as of december  dollars in thousands increase decrease in estimated fair value of equity percentage change increase decrease in estimated fair value of equity percentage change up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points consistent with the results in the interest rate simulation impact on net interest income  our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes has increased as compared to 
table of contents umpqua holdings corporation impact of inflation and changing prices a financial institution s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial firm in that primarily all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature  with relatively little investment in fixed assets or inventories 
inflation has an important impact on the growth of total assets and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain appropriate capital ratios 
we believe that the impact of inflation on financial results depends on management s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
we have an asset liability management program which attempts to manage interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  periodic reviews of banking services and products are conducted to adjust pricing in view of current and expected costs 
our financial statements included in item below have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to measure financial position and operating results principally in terms of historic dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
the primary effect of inflation on our results of operations is through increased operating costs  such as compensation  occupancy and business development expenses 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation 
although interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including us fiscal and monetary policy and general national and global economic conditions
