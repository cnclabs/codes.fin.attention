item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in this report 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
please see those policies in conjunction with this discussion 
critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes that our most critical accounting policies  which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are as follows allowance for loan losses 
arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
the allowance for loan losses provides for probable estimable losses based upon evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management uses historical information  as well as current economic data  to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
although we believe that we use appropriate available information to establish the allowance for loan losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary if certain future events occur that cause actual results to differ from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
for example  a downturn in the local economy could cause an increase in non performing loans 
additionally  a decline in real estate values could reduce the collateral protection of our real estate loans 
in either case  this may require us to increase our provisions for loan losses  which would negatively impact earnings 
the allowance for loan losses discussion in item provides additional information about the allowance 

table of contents income taxes 
management considers accounting for income taxes as a critical accounting policy due to the subjective nature of certain estimates that are involved in the calculation and evaluation of the timing and recognition of resulting tax liabilities and assets 
management uses the asset liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
management must assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets  and to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
adjustments to increase or decrease the valuation allowance are generally charged or credited  respectively  to income tax expense 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
in conjunction with the acquisitions of factory point bancorp  inc in and woronoco bancorp in  goodwill was recorded as an intangible asset equal to the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
other intangible assets were recorded for the fair value of core deposits and non compete agreements 
goodwill and intangible assets related to insurance contracts were recorded for the purchase of insurance agencies in the valuation techniques used by management to determine the carrying value of assets acquired in the acquisition and the estimated lives of identifiable intangible assets involve estimates for discount rates  projected future cash flows and time period calculations  all of which are susceptible to change based on changes in economic conditions and other factors 
future events or changes in the estimates which were used to determine the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets or which otherwise adversely affects their value or estimated lives could have a material adverse impact on future results of operations 
determination of other than temporary impairment of securities 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
consideration is given to length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
the consideration of the above factors are subjective and involve estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those used by management  the actual realization of gains or losses on investment securities could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements 
fair valuation of financial instruments 
the company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures 
trading assets  securities available for sale  and derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  the company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis  or to establish a loss allowance or write down based on the fair value of impaired assets 
further  the notes to financial statements include information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the valuation methodologies used and its impact to earnings 
additionally  for financial instruments not recorded at fair value  the notes to financial statements disclose the estimate of their fair value 
due to the judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimation process  the estimates could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
summary net income rose to a record million in earnings per common share rose to a record 
financial highlights in included increase in total net revenue net interest margin  the highest since increase in total commercial loans  increase in total residential mortgage and home equity loans 
table of contents efficiency ratio  improved from in nonperforming assets to total assets at year end  accruing delinquent loans were of total loans charge offs on average loans public issuance of nearly million in common stock and the issuance of million of preferred stock under the us treasury capital purchase program record results in were the result of positive operating leverage due to the benefit of organic growth and the new vermont operations 
despite the spreading recession in  berkshire hills generated higher year over year earnings per share in every quarter of the year 
these results were achieved despite the impact of berkshire hills october common stock offering  which reduced eps by in the fourth quarter and by for the year 
this successful public offering totaled nearly million and bolstered equity capital  which totaled of total assets at year end 
berkshire hills also issued million in preferred stock under the treasury capital purchase program and agreed to expand the flow of credit and support economic vitality in the communities that it serves 
comparison of financial condition at december  and balance sheet summary 
total assets were billion at year end  increasing by million over year end due to growth in loans and investments 
asset growth was primarily funded by common and preferred stock offerings  together with growth in deposits and borrowings 
nonperforming assets did not increase materially 
the ratio of equity assets increased to at year end from at year end  reflecting the benefit of record earnings and the stock offerings 
investment securities 
total investment securities increased by million in due primarily to purchases of short duration collateralized mortgage obligations issued by federal agencies 
this increase primarily represented the investment of funds provided by capital raises  pending reinvestment in anticipated loan growth in at year end  the company s securities portfolio consisted primarily of us agency mortgage backed securities  and municipal and economic development bonds 
all debt securities were rated investment grade except for million in unrated local municipal and economic development bonds 
the total net unrealized loss on securities available for sale was million at year end of the outstanding balance  all of which was deemed to be temporary 
during the year  berkshire bank entered into an interest rate swap on a million local economic development bond  and as a result this security is carried as a trading security on the balance sheet 
at year end  the company owned a total of million in investment securities  including the trading account security 
securities included million in federal agency mortgage backed securities  million municipal and economic development bonds  million in fhlbb stock  and million in corporate bonds and other securities 
the tax equivalent yield on the portfolio in the fourth quarter of was  compared to in the fourth quarter of the duration of the debt securities at year end was approximately years 
loans 
total loans increased by million 
excluding targeted run off of indirect auto loans  total loans increased by  reflecting growth in total commercial loans  along with higher residential mortgage and home equity loans 
growth in commercial real estate loans mostly reflected loan opportunities previously serviced by national providers in the company s new england lending areas 
home equity loan growth was due to new lines opened as a result of relationship promotions 
residential and home equity underwriting is based on prime lending standards with maximum loan to value 
commercial business loans decreased due to paydowns 
the bank made a decision early in the year to discontinue originations of indirect auto loans and this portfolio is declining as existing balances runoff 
the company has emphasized adherence to strong credit standards and pricing objectives in managing its loan originations 
berkshire bank introduced commercial loan interest rate swaps as a new offering to larger commercial mortgages in this allowed the bank to originate variable rate loans and the customer to swap to a fixed rate 
this contributed to loan growth and fee income in total loans with repricings over five years declined to million at year end from million at the prior year end 
the average yield on loans was in the fourth quarter of  compared to in the fourth quarter of this generally reflected declining rates  the lower percentage of fixed rate loans  and the decrease in indirect auto loans 

table of contents the company s problem loan measures at year end remained comparatively low and were not significantly changed from the prior year end 
year end nonperforming assets totaled of total assets  and accruing delinquent loans were up moderately to of total loans 
year end nonperforming assets included two real estate secured commercial mortgages in the process of foreclosure totaling approximately million each  one loan was related to a recreational income producing property and the other was a condominium construction loan 
there were no other nonperforming assets over million at that date 
in addition to nonperforming loans  the company has identified million in potential problem loans at year end  compared to million at the prior year end 
potential problem loans are loans which are currently performing  but where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in disclosure of such in the future as problem loans 
potential problem loans are typically commercial loans that are performing but are classified by the company s loan rating system as substandard 
at year end  the largest potential problem loans included three commercial mortgages to non profit organizations totaling million  three residential construction loan projects totaling million  and two commercial mortgages totaling million including a lodging loan and a commercial retail rental property 
in several cases  potential problem loans reflect situations in which commercial borrowers increased debt to finance real estate investment and the anticipated cash flow from these investments did not materialize at the projected levels 
economic conditions and other factors may cause these or other loans to become nonaccruing or restructured or to require charge offs in the future 
loan loss allowance 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate 
the company s methodologies for determining the loan loss allowance are discussed in item i of this report 
the company considers the allowance for loan losses of million appropriate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of december  actual future losses may be higher than this estimate and will depend on future economic and financial conditions and regulatory requirements 
at year end  there were significant challenges and uncertainties in the company s environment as described in the economic events section of item i 
the impact of these future events and events in the company s real estate markets is very uncertain 
the company believes that its regional economies generally did not enter the recession until the fourth quarter of while the company has seen an adverse trend in its commercial loan risk ratings  loan performance in remained relatively strong and the company did not believe that inherent losses at year end were outside of the range contemplated by its current loan loss allowance methodology 
the ratio of the loan loss allowance to total loans remained unchanged at of total loans at year end  compared to the prior year end 
the company s net loan charge offs decreased to million in from million in due to one large loan charged off in total non accruing loans were million at year end  which was up modestly from million at the prior year end 
the portion of the allowance assigned to specific reserves on impaired loans was million at year end and million at year end the total amount of loans deemed impaired was million at year end  compared to million at year end 
performing loans included troubled debt restructurings totaling million at year end cash surrender value of life insurance 
berkshire bank owns various life insurance policies which were written as part of the benefits program provided to certain officers in prior years  including policies relating to officers of acquired banks 
the cash surrender value of these policies did not change significantly during  and totaled million at year end 
the year end total included approximately million in general account policies written with an aaa rated insurance company and million written with an aa rated company 
there were no material exposures to carriers below investment grade ratings at year end other assets 
all other assets increased by million to million at year end primarily due to an increase in the net deferred tax asset as a result of tax benefits related to unrealized losses on certain investment securities and derivative financial instruments 

table of contents deposits 
total deposits increased by million to billion in deposit activity included approximately million in targeted run off of higher cost municipal and commercial deposits  and brokered time deposit accounts  primarily in the second quarter 
deposit growth excluding this run off was 
growth in money market and time deposit balances offset a decline in now account balances  and demand deposit and savings balances did not change significantly 
most of berkshire bank s retail deposit and loan promotions are linked to companion checking accounts 
at the beginning of the year  the bank promoted money market accounts due to their lower cost and stronger relationship cross sales 
the company also promotes time deposit account specials when they enhance balance sheet management strategies or when the company feels that the pricing is advantageous 
when rates declined in the fourth quarter  and subsequent to raising nearly million from capital offerings  the company reduced its promotions of interest bearing deposit accounts 
throughout the year  the company carefully hewed to its pricing disciplines in order to support an expansion of the net interest margin and to mitigate the impact of the decision to discontinue originations of indirect auto loans 
most brokered deposits were prepaid  and the total declined to million at year end compared to million at the prior year end 
the bank s deposit growth primarily was in time deposits over thousand  in part reflecting the benefit of the deposit insurance protection offered by the bank 
deposit markets were turbulent in the last several months of the year 
due to the failures and takeovers of investment banks and prominent national banks and mortgage agencies  there was a flight to quality and short term treasury rates were at times negative 
there were several federal interventions in the credit markets  including a federal guarantee of money market funds 
berkshire bank provides insurance on all deposits due to a combination of fdic insurance and the massachusetts depositors insurance fund 
berkshire bank initially received inflows of deposits and benefited from demand for this comprehensive insurance 
the fdic increased deposit insurance on all deposit accounts and optionally made available unlimited insurance on demand deposit balances  which berkshire bank elected to participate in 
federal banking regulators also allowed numerous national financial institutions to convert to bank charters in order to be able to issue fdic guaranteed deposits to replace liquidity sources which became unavailable as national wholesale funding markets contracted 
accordingly  many national institutions offered comparatively high rate time deposits which competed with berkshire bank s deposit accounts 
the fdic also began guaranteeing wholesale debt offerings by participating banks  and these offerings also competed with traditional bank deposits 
due to these factors and the extraordinarily low level of interest rates  total deposits declined by million in the fourth quarter 
borrowings and debentures 
total borrowings and debentures increased by million in total short term debt decreased by million  and longer term fhlbb advances increased by million 
this was the result of the company s strategy to bolster its liquidity and to eliminate its liability sensitivity in its interest rate risk profile 
the company entered into million in adjustable rate term advances from the fhlbb and used interest rate swaps to fix the cost of these advances for periods in the range of years  achieving a fixed interest cost for a total average duration of years on these advances 
berkshire hills bancorp reduced its holding company lines of credit from million to million in due to higher credit costs 
derivative financial instruments 
the company established relationships with several national banks in in order to be able to enter into interest rate swaps 
at year end  the company had million outstanding in gross notional balances of interest rate swaps 
in addition to swaps related to federal home loan bank borrowings  the company has also entered into swaps related to a trading investment security  to the company s trust preferred debenture  and to back to back swaps arranged with commercial borrowers 
at year end  the company had swaps with gross unrealized losses totaling million and gross unrealized gains totaling million 
the unrealized losses related primarily to swaps used to fix the interest rates on federal home loan bank borrowings  which were valued at a discount at year end due to the low rates resulting from government interventions to respond to the economic crisis 
if the company had instead fixed these rates directly with the federal home loan bank as it previously did  there would have been no market value adjustment recorded to the company s balance sheet 
the increase in other liabilities was primarily due to the swap unrealized losses  together with a clearing balance due to broker 
equity 
stockholders equity increased by million  including the benefit of million in proceeds from common stock and preferred stock offerings 
the contribution of earnings was mostly offset by dividends  stock repurchases  and unrealized losses on securities and derivative financial instruments 
the ratio of total equity to assets increased to at year end  compared to at the prior year end 
reflecting the additional shares outstanding  book value per common share was at year end  compared to at the prior year end 

table of contents in october  berkshire hills issued million shares of common stock  including an over allotment amount which was issued early in november 
these shares were publicly issued under the company s universal securities shelf registration with the sec 
the company received cash proceeds of million from this stock issuance  net of underwriting discounts and expenses 
the shares were sold at an average gross price of per share 
berkshire hills deposited the cash proceeds into a deposit account at the bank and maintained these cash balances at year end to support future growth opportunities and potential further investment in the bank 
in december  berkshire hills issued thousand shares of preferred stock to the united states department of the treasury under its capital purchase program in exchange for cash proceeds of million 
under the related agreement  berkshire hills also issued a ten year warrant for  common shares exercisable at per share 
the company amended its sec shelf registration and issued these securities under that registration 
the preferred stock will pay cumulative dividends at the rate of per year for the first five years  and thereafter 
the agreement included significant restrictions on repayment of the preferred stock  on common stock repurchases and dividends  on executive compensation  and other aspects of corporate governance 
under the agreement  the company pledged to expand the flow of credit to us consumers and businesses on competitive terms to promote the sustained growth and vitality of the us economy and to work diligently under existing programs to modify the terms of residential mortgages as appropriate to strengthen the health of the us housing market 
please see additional related discussion in the stockholders equity note to the financial statements in item of this report 
the agreement allows congress to unilaterally modify and or add terms to the agreement 
new terms were added in february and additional changes continue to be proposed in congress 
the company is evaluating the benefits of continuing to participate in this program and its options to repurchase this preferred stock 
berkshire hills contributed million of the cash proceeds as additional capital to the bank  and held the remainder as deposits in the bank to be used as potential future capital contributions to the bank or to service dividend payments on the preferred stock 
at year end  there were approximately  shares remaining available to be issued under the company s universal shelf registration  which expires in october  the bank met all regulatory capital requirements at year end and continued to satisfy the conditions necessary to be classified as well capitalized in accordance with federal regulatory standards 
the bank s risk based capital was at year end compared to at year end during  the bank paid million in dividends to the holding company  and proceeds were generally used to reduce outstanding debt of berkshire hills

earnings per share increased by to a record in from in earnings per share increased by in compared to the result in before the above mentioned acquisition and restructuring charges 
this increase included accretion from the factory point acquisition  the benefit of the balance sheet restructuring  and the benefit of organic growth and an improved net interest margin in the return on assets increased to in from in  and the return on equity increased to from 
these returns in were the highest level reported by the company since the net interest margin was the highest since these results show the benefit resulting from acquisitions and organic growth in recent years which allowed berkshire hills to develop its management  infrastructure  and integration with the goal of achieving higher franchise and stockholder value 
additionally  the bank s ten branch de novo expansion into the new york albany region continued to mature  reaching million in total deposits  and with four branches operating at or above the breakeven level at year end 

table of contents berkshire hills common and preferred stock placements in the fourth quarter of decreased the company s leverage  and this was expected to initially result in annualized earnings per share dilution of related to the common stock and related to the preferred stock 
because these stock offerings were late in the year  the impact on earnings per share was for the common stock  and there was no impact for the preferred stock 
actual dilution in will depend primarily on the pace of loan growth and any increase in leverage that the company may produce

total revenue increased by in to million from million primarily due to the benefit of acquired vermont operations 
revenue in was higher than the pro forma combined revenue including vermont operations and excluding balance sheet restructuring charges

net interest income was up in the fourth quarter of compared to the impacts of the vermont operations and balance sheet restructuring were included in results beginning in the fourth quarter of average interest bearing assets and liabilities were each up approximately due to the vermont operations and organic growth 
average earning assets increased sequentially in each quarter in  with the fourth quarter average exceeding the fourth quarter average by 
this was primarily driven by continuous loan growth  despite the impact of targeted runoff in the indirect auto loan portfolio 
the net interest margin increased to in from in  reflecting the benefit of higher margin vermont operations  the balance sheet restructuring  and improved pricing spreads in the fourth quarter net interest margin was in compared to in the margin increased sequentially in the first three quarters of  reaching in the third quarter 
this was achieved despite the decision to fix the rates on more than million in federal home loan bank advances to reduce the sensitivity of earnings to anticipated future interest rate hikes 
these fixed rates were achieved through interest rate swaps  and the company accepted the higher current period interest costs to improve expected future earnings 
in the fourth quarter  the net interest margin decreased to and it is expected to decrease further in due to the global financial crisis and extraordinary federal interventions  short term treasury rates at times dipped below zero in the fourth quarter 
due to usual market floors for deposit rates in its regional markets  and due to competition from distressed national financial institutions  the company was unable to fully offset the decline in loan interest income by reducing deposit costs 
the effective cost of deposits also increased due to higher fdic insurance premiums  which are included in non interest expense 
the yield on interest bearing assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased sequentially in each quarter of the year  primarily reflecting the reduction in short term interest rates during the year 
the yield on earning assets also decreased due to the targeted run off of higher yielding indirect auto loans and promotions of lower yielding home equity lines of credit 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities reflected the benefit of targeted run off of higher cost deposit accounts

net loan charge offs declined to million from million for these periods  charge offs in included million in losses recorded on one commercial credit with borrower fraud 
the company anticipates that the amount of net loan charge offs and the loan loss provision will increase in the coming year due to the increase in potential problem loans and an expected deepening of the recession in the economy and real estate markets 
while the national and global financial outlook is considered by many to be a crisis  the impact of the downturn in the company s lending markets is uncertain and may not be as severe as in other regions of the country

off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of operations  the company engages in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are not recorded in the company s financial statements 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit

impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented in this form k have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of berkshire bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on berkshire bank s performance than the general level of inflation 
interest rates may be affected by inflation  but the direction and magnitude of the impact may vary

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk and market risk analysis qualitative aspects of market risk 
the bank s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
the bank seeks to avoid fluctuations in its net interest income and to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk through periods of changing interest rates 
berkshire bank maintains an asset liability committee that is responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position 
this committee meets monthly and reports trends and interest rate risk position to the risk management committee and board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the company s earnings 
the bank has managed interest rate risk by emphasizing assets with shorter term repricing durations  periodically selling long term fixed rate assets  promoting low cost core deposits  and using fhlbb advances to structure its liability repricing durations 
berkshire bank also uses interest rate swaps in order to enhance its interest rate risk position and manage its balance sheet 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
the company uses a simulation model to measure the potential change in net interest income that would result from both an instantaneous or ramped change in market interest rates assuming a parallel shift along the entire yield curve 
the chart below shows the analysis of a ramped change 
the range of the ramp was shifted up at year end in the chart due to the very low interest rates prevailing at that date 
loans  deposits and borrowings were expected to reprice at the repricing or maturity date 
the company uses prepayment guidelines set forth by market sources as well as company generated data where applicable 
cash flows from loans and securities are assumed to be reinvested based on current operating conditions and strategies 
other assumptions about balance sheet mix are generally held constant 
no material changes have been made to the methodologies used in the model 
change in interest rates basis points rate ramp months months dollars in thousands change change change change at december  at december  
table of contents during  the company shifted from a moderately liability sensitive profile to a moderately asset sensitive profile 
this shift reflects the company s general preference to be modestly asset sensitive and also reflects management s expectations that inflation and interest rates will rise from recent low levels 
factors contributing to this shift included the shift in consumer lending from fixed rate indirect auto loans to prime based home equity lines  as well as the stock common and preferred stock offerings which were reinvested in short term investments and low duration mortgage backed securities at year end 
berkshire bank entered into million in cash flow interest rate swaps to fix the rate on adjustable rate federal home loan bank advances to match the rate duration on existing residential and commercial mortgage loans 
the company also entered into swaps to convert a million fixed rate economic development bond to variable rate and to fix the interest rate on the company s million in trust preferred debentures 
additionally  the company also began offering back to back interest rate swaps to certain commercial borrowers  and thereby was able to originate adjustable rate commercial loans which the customers swapped into fixed interest rates 
this allowed berkshire bank to fund these loans with short term deposits  including money market accounts which help the company grow its core transaction based customer deposit franchise 
due to the limitations and uncertainties relating to model assumptions  the above computations should not be relied on as projections of income 
further  the computations do not reflect any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the most significant assumption relates to expectations for the interest sensitivity of non maturity deposit accounts in a rising rate environment 
the model assumes that deposit rate sensitivity will be a percentage of the market interest rate change as follows now accounts ranging between and depending on product type  money market accounts ranging between and depending on the balance and product type  and savings accounts 
one of the significant limitations of the simulation is that it assumes parallel shifts in the yield curve 
actual interest rate risks are often more complex than this scenario 
a key interest rate change in was the steepening of the yield curve in the second half of the year 
assumption changes in were based on a review of past performance and future expectations and were not viewed as material
