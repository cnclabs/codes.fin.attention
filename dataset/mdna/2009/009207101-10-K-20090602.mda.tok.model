the ground support services segment  comprised of its global aviation services  llc gas subsidiary  provides ground support equipment maintenance and facilities maintenance services to domestic airlines and aviation service providers 
each business segment has separate management teams and infrastructures that offer different products and services 
the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on operating income 
prior to the quarter ended september   the company had reported two operating segments  previously combining ggs and gas into a single segment 
the company has modified the prior period s segment information to conform to the current period presentation 
following is a table detailing revenues by segment and by major customer category in thousands year ended march  overnight air cargo segment fedex other maintenance ground equipment sales segment military commercial domestic commercial international ground support services segment mac and csa are short haul express airfreight carriers and provide air cargo services to one primary customer  fedex corporation fedex 
mac also on occasion provides maintenance services to other airline customers and the u 
s 
military 
under the terms of dry lease service agreements  which currently cover all of the revenue aircraft  the company receives a monthly administrative fee based on the number of aircraft operated and passes through to its customer certain cost components of its operations without markup 
the cost of fuel  flight crews  landing fees  outside maintenance  parts and certain other direct operating costs are included in operating expenses and billed to the customer as cargo and maintenance revenue  at cost 
pursuant to such agreements  fedex determines the type of aircraft and schedule of routes to be flown by mac and csa  with all other operational decisions made by the company 
these agreements are renewable on two to five year terms and may be terminated by fedex at any time upon days notice 
the company believes that the short term and other provisions of its agreements with fedex are standard within the airfreight contract delivery service industry 
fedex has been a customer of the company since loss of its contracts with fedex would have a material adverse effect on the company 
mac and csa combined revenues increased by  in fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily related to flight and maintenance department costs passed through to its customer at cost as well as increased maintenance labor revenue as a result of increased maintenance hours and rates 
ggs manufactures and supports aircraft deicers and other specialized industrial equipment on a worldwide basis 
ggs manufactures five basic models of mobile deicing equipment with capacities ranging from to  gallons 
ggs also provides fixed pedestal mounted deicers 
each model can be customized as requested by the customer  including single operator configuration  fire suppressant equipment  open basket or enclosed cab  a patented forced air deicing nozzle and on board glycol blending system to substantially reduce glycol usage  color and style of the exterior finish 
ggs also manufactures four models of scissor lift equipment  for catering  cabin service and maintenance service of aircraft  and has developed a line of decontamination equipment and other special purpose mobile equipment 
ggs competes primarily on the basis of the quality  performance and reliability of its products  prompt delivery  customer service and price 
in june  ggs was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force 
in june  ggs was awarded a three year extension of that contract and a further three year extension was awarded in june this contract expires in june ggs contributed approximately  and  to the company s revenues for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the  increase in revenues was due to an increase in the number of military deicing units delivered  an increase in the number of commercial catering trucks and an increase in the number of international commercial orders completed during the current year  offset by a decrease in the number of commercial deicer units delivered in the current year 
gas was formed in september to operate the aircraft ground support equipment and airport facility maintenance services business of the company 
gas is providing aircraft ground support equipment and airport facility maintenance services to a wide variety of customers at a number of locations throughout the country 
gas contributed approximately  and  to the company s revenues for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the  increase in revenues was due to the growth and expansion of gas as it continued to add new customers and service locations in its first full year of operations 
gas has grown to of consolidated revenues for the year ended march  fiscal highlights the company has produced record revenues and profit for the fiscal year ended march  with outstanding results for the first two quarters and solid results for the last two quarters of the year 
overall  we are pleased with the results  but the general economic and industry conditions continue to be a major concern and as a result we remain cautious going forward 
in these difficult times  we remain dedicated to conserving cash  watching and controlling costs  tightening our credit policies and maintaining our customer and vendor relationships 
during the year ended march   revenues from our gas subsidiary totaled  this new line of business continues to expand its customer base 
gas s main challenges continue to be its ability to add additional customers and develop existing ones to optimally utilize our staffing capacity at existing locations 
we also continue to monitor the northwest airlines and delta airlines merger as the former northwest airlines comprised a majority of gas s business in the fiscal year ended march  our overnight air cargo segment increased its operating income by  or in fiscal as a result of reduced operating costs and increased maintenance revenues 
one key factor is that our fleet of atr aircraft has now reached its first cycle of heavy maintenance since they were acquired and converted to freighter configuration 
as a result  maintenance hours have increased this fiscal year leading to increased revenues and profitability in our air cargo segment 
offsetting this is the fact that the number of aircraft that we operate for fedex has decreased from at march  to as of march  two atr aircraft were damaged beyond repair by a tornado in greensboro  nc in may in addition  the last fokker f operated by mac was retired in january finally  fedex made the decision to take four cessna caravan b aircraft out of service in february as a result  the company experienced a decrease in its administrative fee revenue of  in fiscal the aggregate administrative fee revenue associated with these aircraft if they are out of service for a full year approximates  revenues for ggs for the year ended march  were up over the prior year  while operating income was up  or 
ggs operated at unusually high production levels for the first two quarters of fiscal as a result of the significant backlog at march  ggs produced and delivered a high volume of deicers to the military in fiscal as well as a high volume of commercial catering trucks 
in addition  ggs delivered an increased number of commercial units to various international customers during the year 
ggs s gross margin percentage for the year was up one half percent as a result of changes in product and customer mix two additional lawsuits in connection with the philadelphia boom incident were settled during the year as disclosed during the third quarter 
a settlement of the u 
s 
airways suit was reached with all parties  with no additional financial impact to the company 
in addition  the suit in which the company was seeking to recover approximately  in costs incurred by the company was settled for  which the company will receive over two and a half years 
the  settlement has been recognized in other income and as a receivable in the year ended march  for a discussion of these settlements and the ongoing status of the related matters  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part ii  item of this report 
during the year ended march   the company amended the employment agreement of william h 
simpson  the company s executive vice president and the sole executive still covered under a supplemental retirement agreement 
the amendment deleted all provisions providing for certain payments to be made to mr 
simpson upon his retirement and replaces them with an obligation for the company to pay mr 
simpson in july an amount designed to equal the amount that he would have been entitled to receive had he retired at that time and elected to receive a lump sum payment 
the actual amount of that liability will be dependent upon existing interest rates at the time  but has been estimated at  based upon current information and rates 
the settlement resulted in an estimated loss of  which has been expensed in the year ended march  fiscal vs 
consolidated revenue increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenue resulted from an increase in air cargo revenue of  to  combined with an increase in ground equipment sales revenue of  to  and an increase in ground support services revenue of  to  the increase in air cargo revenue was primarily the result of an increase in flight and maintenance department costs passed through to its customer at cost as well as increased maintenance labor revenue 
maintenance labor revenue was up as a result of increased maintenance hours due to an increase in scheduled maintenance events in fiscal in addition  the company received approval from its customer for an increase in its maintenance billable labor rate in june and an additional increase in january these rate increases are provided periodically  as a means to offset increases in maintenance operating costs 
the increase in ground equipment revenue was the result of a significant increase in the number of military and international deicers as well as commercial catering trucks sold in fiscal compared to  which offset a decrease in the number of commercial deicers sold in fiscal in addition  gas contributed revenue of  in fiscal reflecting its continuing growth in customers and locations in the past year 
operating expenses on a consolidated basis increased  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was due to a number of factors 
operating expenses in the air cargo segment were up  primarily as a result of increased flight and maintenance costs passed through to its customer at cost and increased in house and contracted maintenance labor costs 
ground equipment sales operating costs increased   driven primarily by the current year s increase in units sold 
the ground support services segment reported a  increase in operating expenses directly related to the increased revenue and level of operations provided by gas over the past year as it continues to grow 
general and administrative expense increased  to  in fiscal the most significant component of this increase was a  increase in general and administrative expense associated with the continuing growth and expansion of the gas operations  which began operating in september profit sharing expense increased by  directly related to the increased profit generated by the company in fiscal operating income for the year ended march  was  a  improvement over fiscal the improvement came from all three segments of our business as increased maintenance hours and rates increased our operating income in the air cargo segment  additional sales revenues increased our operating income in the ground equipment sales segment and the growth and maturing of our relatively new ground support services segment resulted in its increased operating income 
non operating income  net for the year ended march  was  a  increase over fiscal the  lawsuit settlement in december was a principal component of this increase 
this income was partially offset by the  retirement plan settlement expense recorded in december  relating to the amendment to mr 
simpson s employment agreement described above 
interest expense decreased by  as the company elected to utilize its available cash to minimize line of credit usage and also to reduce the chassis flooring during the year 
investment income also declined by  as a result of the continuing decrease in rates of return on cash investments during the current year

accounts receivable are down primarily due to the significant decrease in ggs sales in the fourth quarter of compared to inventories have increased due to chassis and other large deicer components that were purchased in the past year in anticipation of expected contract awards and delivery timeframes that have not yet materialized 
the inventory is all considered useable on future commercial deicer orders 
the company had no outstanding obligations under its line of credit at march  and in august  the company amended its  secured long term revolving credit line to extend its expiration date to august  the revolving credit line contains customary events of default  a subjective acceleration clause and restrictive covenants that  among other matters  require the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
there is no requirement for the company to maintain a lock box arrangement under this agreement 
as of march   the company was in compliance with all of the restrictive covenants 
the amount of credit available to the company under the agreement at any given time is determined by an availability calculation  based on the eligible borrowing base  as defined in the credit agreement  which includes the company s outstanding receivables  inventories and equipment  with certain exclusions

accounts receivable have decreased at march  as a result of decreased sales in the fourth quarter as well as an expanded effort to collect and manage receivables 
cash provided by investing activities for fiscal was  more than fiscal  largely due to a change in investment strategy  with the resulting sale of short term investments in exchange for cash and equivalents 
in fiscal  capital expenditures decreased by cash used in financing activities was  less in fiscal compared to fiscal principally due to less cash outlay under the stock repurchase plan

simpson upon his retirement and replaces them with an obligation for the company to pay mr 
simpson in july  an amount designed to equal the amount that he would have been entitled to receive had he retired at that time and elected to receive a lump sum

the company is not currently engaged in the use of any of these arrangements 
impact of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its manufacturing operations  because increased costs to date have been passed on to its customers 
under the terms of its air cargo business contracts the major cost components of its operations  consisting principally of fuel  crew and other direct operating costs  and certain maintenance costs are reimbursed  without markup by its customer 
significant increases in inflation rates could  however  have a material impact on future revenue and operating income 
seasonality ggs s business has historically been seasonal 
the company has continued its efforts to reduce ggs s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by increasing military and international sales and broadening its product line to increase revenues and earnings throughout the year 
in june  ggs was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force  and ggs has been awarded two three year extensions on the contract  with the final extension expiring in june although sales remain somewhat seasonal  this diversification has lessened the seasonal impacts and allowed the company to be more efficient in its planning and production 
with the expiration of ggs s contract with the united states air force  more pronounced seasonal trends could resume 
the air cargo and ground support services segments of business are not susceptible to seasonal trends
