overview business overview the company  a self managed and self administered reit  integrates owning  managing and developing income producing real estate properties associated primarily with the delivery of outpatient healthcare services throughout the united states 
management believes that by providing a complete spectrum of real estate services  the company can differentiate its competitive market position  expand its asset base and increase revenues over time 
the company s revenues are generally derived from rentals on its healthcare real estate properties 
the company incurs operating and administrative expenses  including compensation  office rent and other related occupancy costs  as well as various expenses incurred in connection with managing its existing portfolio and acquiring additional properties 
the company also incurs interest expense on its various debt instruments and depreciation and amortization expense on its real estate portfolio 
executive overview over the last few years  the market for quality medical office and other outpatient related facilities attracted many non traditional and or highly leveraged buyers  which resulted in a significant increase in the competition for these assets 
the recent and ongoing turmoil in the credit markets  however  has resulted in the company seeing fewer buyers competing for such properties  which has provided more opportunities to acquire real estate properties with attractive risk adjusted returns 
while management has observed only a slight decrease in asset prices  the company s relatively conservative capital structure positions it well to take advantage of the current credit market dislocation and any resulting future decline in asset prices 
in  the company acquired approximately million in real estate assets and funded million in a new mortgage note receivable 
in january  the company acquired the remaining membership interest in a joint venture in which it previously held a minority interest for approximately million and assumed related debt of approximately million

the company expects completion of the core and shell of three of the projects with budgets totaling approximately million during and expects completion of the fourth project with a budget totaling approximately million in the first quarter of in addition to the projects currently under construction  the company is financing an on campus medical office development of an outpatient campus comprised of six facilities  with a total budget of approximately million  of which the company has already advanced million 
the company expects to finance the remaining million during and with respect to five of the six facilities  the company will have an option to purchase each such facility at a market cap rate upon its completion and full occupancy 
the sixth facility is being acquired by the tenant 
the company s real estate portfolio  diversified by facility type  geography  tenant and payor mix  helps mitigate its exposure to fluctuating economic conditions  tenant and sponsor credit risks  and changes in clinical practice patterns 
at december   the company s leverage ratio 
debt divided by debt plus 
table of contents stockholders equity less intangible assets plus accumulated depreciation 
was approximately with of its debt portfolio maturing after the company had borrowings outstanding under its unsecured credit facility totaling million at december   with a capacity remaining of million 
capital and credit market conditions the capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure or near failure of a number of large financial institutions 
the company believes its conservative capital structure will foster stable operations throughout this time with no debt maturities in  its million unsecured credit facility maturing in january and its two million senior notes maturing in and however  continued volatility in the markets could limit the company s ability to access debt or equity markets when needed which  in turn  could impact the company s ability to invest in real estate assets  refinance maturing debt and react to changing economic and business conditions 
the company s debt ratings could also be affected  adversely impacting its interest costs and financing sources 
the company also had unencumbered real estate assets of approximately billion at december   which could serve as collateral for secured mortgage financing 
furthermore  the company anticipates renewing its unsecured credit facility during and believes that sufficient commitments will be available to the company  but believes that the interest rate upon renewal will likely be higher than its current rate libor trends and matters impacting operating results management monitors factors and trends important to the company and reit industry in order to gauge the potential impact on the operations of the company 
discussed below are some of the factors and trends that management believes may impact future operations of the company 
as of december   approximately of the company s real estate investments consisted of properties leased to unaffiliated lessees pursuant to long term net lease agreements or subject to financial support agreements  approximately were multi tenanted properties with shorter term occupancy leases  and the remaining of investments were related to land held for development  corporate property  mortgage notes receivable and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures which are invested in real estate properties 
the company s long term net leases and financial support agreements are generally designed to ensure the continuity of revenues and coverage of costs and expenses relating to the properties by the tenants and the sponsoring healthcare operators 
there is no assurance that the company s leases and financial support agreements will be extended past their expiration dates which could impact the company s operating results as described in more detail below in expiring leases and financial support agreements 
acquisition activity during  the company acquired real estate properties and funded a mortgage note receivable for approximately million and assumed related debt of approximately million  net of fair value adjustments  including an interest in a joint venture that concurrently acquired four buildings for an investment of million 
these acquisitions were funded with net proceeds from an equity offering in september totaling million  the assumption of existing mortgage debt  borrowings on the unsecured credit facility  and proceeds from real estate dispositions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these acquisitions 
development activity during  five buildings that were previously under construction commenced operations and one construction project was reclassified to land held for development  resulting in four construction projects remaining that were underway at december  with budgets totaling approximately million 
the company expects completion of the core and shell of three of the four projects with budgets totaling approximately million during and expects the core and shell of the fourth project with a budget totaling approximately million to be completed during the first quarter of in addition to the 
table of contents projects currently under construction  the company is financing an on campus medical office development of an outpatient campus comprised of six facilities  with a total budget of approximately million  of which the company has already advanced million 
the company expects to finance the remaining million during and with respect to five of the six facilities  the company will have an option to purchase each such facility at a market cap rate upon its completion and full occupancy 
the sixth facility is being acquired by the tenant 
the company s ability to complete  lease up and operate these facilities in a given period of time will impact the company s results of operations and cash flows 
more favorable completion dates  lease up periods and rental rates will result in improved results of operations and cash flows  while lagging completion dates  lease up periods and rental rates will likely result in less favorable results of operations and cash flows 
the company s disclosures regarding projections or estimates of completion dates and leasing may not reflect actual results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the company s development activities 
dispositions during  the company disposed of seven real estate properties for approximately million and disposed of two parcels of land for approximately million 
also  a portion of the company s preferred equity investment in a joint venture was redeemed for million and one mortgage note receivable totaling approximately million was repaid 
proceeds from these dispositions were used to repay amounts under the unsecured credit facility and to fund additional real estate investments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these dispositions 
potential acquisitions and dispositions as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company had several acquisitions and dispositions pending at december  that will impact the company s operating results for when or if those transactions are completed 
purchase option provisions as discussed in liquidity and capital resources  certain of the company s leases include purchase option provisions  which if exercised  could require the company to sell a property to a lessee or operator  which could have a negative impact on the company s future results of operations and cash flows 
expiring leases and financial support agreements master leases on of the company s properties will expire in the company has decided not to extend the master leases relating to about one half of these properties 
the master leases the company has decided not to extend are multi tenanted properties on or near hospital campuses and in locations where the company already has existing management capabilities 
with respect to the remaining properties  the company believes that either the current tenants will extend their leases or the company will lease the property to another single tenant 
approximately of the company s leases in its multi tenanted buildings will expire in  with each tenant lessee occupying an average of approximately  square feet 
approximately of the multi tenant leases expiring in relate to buildings acquired in  in which each lessee occupies approximately  square feet 
about of the leases expiring were signed with hospital related entities upon closing of the real estate property acquisitions  and the remainder of the leases are related to non hospital tenants 
historically  hospital related tenants who occupy space in on campus buildings have a high probability of renewal 
also  management expects that the majority of the non hospital tenants will renew at favorable rates 
one of the company s financial support agreements also expires in the company does not expect the sponsor to extend its agreement with the company 

table of contents with the expirations discussed above  the company expects there could be a short term negative impact to its results of operations  but anticipates that over time it will be able to re lease the properties or increase tenant rents to offset any short term decline in revenue 
discontinued operations in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  a company must present the results of operations of real estate assets disposed of or held for sale as discontinued operations 
therefore  the results of operations from such assets are classified as discontinued operations for the current period  and all prior periods presented are restated to conform to the current period presentation 
readers of the company s consolidated financial statements should be aware that each future disposal will result in a change to the presentation of the company s operations in the historical consolidated statements of income as previously filed 
such reclassifications to the consolidated statements of income will have no impact on previously reported net income 
amortization of in place leases as discussed in application of critical accounting policies to accounting estimates and in note to the consolidated financial statements  when a building is acquired with in place leases  sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 
 requires that the cost of the acquisition be allocated between the tangible real estate and the intangible assets related to in place leases based on their fair values 
where appropriate  the intangible assets recorded could include goodwill  ground leases or customer relationship assets 
the value of above or below market in place leases is amortized against rental income or property operating expense over the average remaining term of the leases in place upon acquisition 
the amortization periods of the intangibles may be relatively short  such as with a short term tenant lease  or may be longer  such as with a long term ground lease 
the value of at market in place leases and other intangible assets is amortized and reflected in amortization expense in the company s consolidated statements of income 
amortization expense related to these in place leases may increase or decrease because of new in place leases recorded related to new real estate acquisitions or because of in place leases becoming fully amortized 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo and ffo per share are operating performance measures adopted by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit 
nareit defines ffo as the most commonly accepted and reported measure of a reit s operating performance equal to net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
impairment charges may not be added back to net income in calculating ffo  which have the effect of decreasing ffo in the period recorded 
in  the company recognized additional income for certain items which increased ffo  including net gains on repurchases of the company s senior notes due and of approximately million  termination fees of approximately million and the recognition of straight line rent income for prior years related to a joint venture of approximately million  which were partially offset by a reserve recorded on an outstanding receivable of approximately million and a million accrual recorded related to a litigation settlement 
these items had the net effect of increasing ffo by approximately per share for the year ended december  also  for the years ended  and  the company recorded impairment charges totaling million  million and million  respectively  which reduced ffo per diluted share by approximately  and  respectively 
the comparability of ffo for the three years ending december  is also impacted by the senior living asset dispositions during  because of the elimination of the operations of the divested assets 
ffo and ffo per share generated by the senior living assets disposed of during totaled approximately million  or per basic common share per diluted common share  for the year ended december  and approximately million  or per basic common share per diluted common share  for the year ended december  
table of contents management believes ffo and ffo per share to be supplemental measures of a reit s performance because they provide an understanding of the operating performance of the company s properties without giving effect to certain significant non cash items  primarily depreciation and amortization expense 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  gaap  assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
however  real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
the company believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo and ffo per share can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods 
management uses ffo and ffo per share to compare and evaluate its own operating results from period to period  and to monitor the operating results of the company s peers in the reit industry 
the company reports ffo and ffo per share because these measures are observed by management to also be the predominant measures used by the reit industry and by industry analysts to evaluate reits and because ffo per share is consistently reported  discussed  and compared by research analysts in their notes and publications about reits 
for these reasons  management has deemed it appropriate to disclose and discuss ffo and ffo per share 
however  ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity

liquidity net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
the company s cash flows are dependent upon rental rates on leases  occupancy levels of the multi tenanted buildings  acquisition and disposition activity during the year  and the level of operating expenses  among other factors 
cash flows from operations were impacted by the senior living dispositions in as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company plans to continue to meet its liquidity needs  including funding additional investments in  paying dividends  and funding debt service  with cash flows from operations  borrowings under the unsecured credit facility  proceeds of mortgage notes receivable repayments  proceeds from sales of real estate investments  proceeds from secured debt borrowings  or additional capital market financings

furthermore  the company anticipates renewing its unsecured credit facility during and believes that sufficient commitments will be available to the company  but anticipates that the interest rate upon renewal will likely be higher than its current rate libor 
the company believes that its liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to satisfy its cash requirements 
the company cannot  however  be certain that these sources of funds will be available at a time and upon terms acceptable to the company in sufficient amounts to meet its liquidity needs 
the company has some exposure to variable interest rates and its stock price has been impacted by the volatility in the stock markets 
however  the company s leases  which provide its main source of income and cash flow  are generally fixed in nature  have terms of approximately one to years and have annual rate increases based generally on consumer price indices 

table of contents impact of inflation inflation has not significantly affected the company s earnings due to the moderate inflation rate in recent years and the fact that most of the company s leases and financial support arrangements require tenants and sponsors to pay all or some portion of the increases in operating expenses  thereby reducing the company s risk of the adverse effects of inflation 
in addition  inflation has the effect of increasing gross revenue the company is to receive under the terms of certain leases and financial support arrangements 
leases and financial support arrangements vary in the remaining terms of obligations  further reducing the company s risk of any adverse effects of inflation 
interest payable under the unsecured credit facility is calculated at a variable rate  therefore  the amount of interest payable under the unsecured credit facility is influenced by changes in short term rates  which tend to be sensitive to inflation 
during periods where interest rate increases outpace inflation  the company s operating results should be negatively impacted 
conversely  when increases in inflation outpace increases in interest rates  the company s operating results should be positively impacted

application of critical accounting policies to accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to exercise judgment and make assumptions that impact the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
management routinely evaluates the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
these regular evaluations consider historical experience and other reasonable factors and use the seasoned judgment of management personnel 
management has reviewed the company s critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
management believes the following paragraphs in this section describe the application of critical accounting policies by management to arrive at the critical accounting estimates reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounting policies are more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the potential for impairment of identifiable intangible assets and long lived assets  including real estate properties  whenever events occur or a change in circumstances indicates that the recorded 
table of contents value might not be fully recoverable 
important factors that could cause management to review for impairment include significant underperformance of an asset relative to historical or expected operating results  significant changes in the company s use of assets or the strategy for its overall business  plans to sell an asset before its depreciable life has ended  or significant negative economic trends or negative industry trends for the company or its operators 
in addition  the company reviews for possible impairment those assets subject to purchase options and those impacted by casualties  such as hurricanes 
as required by sfas no 
 if management determines that the carrying value of the company s assets may not be fully recoverable based on the existence of any of the factors above  or others  management would measure and record impairment based on the estimated fair value of the property 
the company recorded impairments of million  million  and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and related to real estate properties and other long lived assets 
the impairment charges in included a million impairment charge on a long lived asset  a million impairment charge related to two properties sold in  and an million impairment charge related to two properties classified as held for sale in the impairment charges in included a million impairment charge in connection with the sale of a property in texas and a million impairment charge related to six properties classified as held for sale as of december   reducing the company s carrying values on the properties to the estimated fair values of the properties less costs to sell 
the impairment charges in included a million impairment charge related to a long lived asset  a million impairment charge to adjust the company s carrying value of one building to its estimated fair value less costs to sell  and a million impairment charge related to one property sold in as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 the company performs an annual goodwill impairment review 
the company s reviews are performed as of december of each year 
the company s and reviews indicated that no impairment had occurred with respect to the company s million goodwill asset 
capitalization of costs gaap generally allows for the capitalization of various types of costs 
the rules and regulations on capitalizing costs and the subsequent depreciation or amortization of those costs versus expensing them in the period incurred vary depending on the type of costs and the reason for capitalizing the costs 
direct costs generally include construction costs  professional services such as architectural and legal costs  travel expenses  land acquisition costs as well as other types of fees and expenses 
these costs are capitalized as part of the basis of an asset to which such costs relate 
indirect costs include capitalized interest and overhead costs 
the company s overhead costs are based on overhead load factors that are charged to a project based on direct time incurred 
the company computes the overhead load factors annually for its acquisition and development departments  which have employees who are involved in the projects 
the overhead load factors are computed to absorb that portion of indirect employee costs payroll and benefits  training  occupancy and similar costs that are attributable to the productive time the employee incurs working directly on projects 
the employees in the company s acquisitions and development departments who work on these projects maintain and report their hours daily  by project 
employee costs that are administrative  such as vacation time  sick time  or general and administrative time  are expensed in the period incurred 
management s judgment is also exercised in determining whether costs that have been previously capitalized in pursuit of an acquisition or development project should be reserved for or written off if the project is abandoned or should circumstances otherwise change that would call the project s viability into question 
the company follows a standard and consistently applied policy of classifying pursuit activity as well as reserving for those types of costs based on their classification 
the company classifies its pursuit projects into four categories 
the first category includes pursuits that have a remote chance of producing new business 
costs for these projects are expensed in the period incurred 
the second category includes pursuits that might reasonably be expected to produce new business opportunities although there can be no assurance that they will result in a new project or contract 
costs for these projects are capitalized but  due to the uncertainty of projects in this category  these costs are reserved at  
table of contents which means that of the costs are expensed in the period incurred 
the third category includes those pursuits that are either highly probable to result in a project or contract or already have resulted in a project or contract in which the contract requires the operator to reimburse the company s costs 
many times  these are pursuits involving operators with which the company is already doing business 
since the company believes it is probable that these pursuits will result in a project or contract  it capitalizes these costs in full and records no reserve 
the fourth category includes pursuits that involve the acquisition of existing buildings 
as required by the emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for internal costs relating to real estate property acquisitions  the company expenses in the period incurred all internal costs related to those types of acquisitions 
each quarter  all capitalized pursuit costs are again reviewed carefully for viability or a change in classification  and a management decision is made as to whether any additional reserve is deemed necessary 
if necessary and considered appropriate  management would record an additional reserve at that time 
capitalized pursuit costs  net of the reserve  are carried in other assets in the company s consolidated balance sheets  and any reserve recorded is charged to general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
these pursuit costs will ultimately be written off to expense or will be capitalized as part of the constructed real estate asset 
as of december  and  the company had capitalized pursuit costs totaling million and million  respectively  and had provided reserves against these capitalized pursuit costs of million and million  respectively 
the company s capitalization policies will be impacted upon the adoption of sfas no

r which became effective for the company on january  see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of sfas no

depreciation of real estate assets and amortization of related intangible assets as of december   the company had investments of approximately billion in depreciable real estate assets and related intangible assets 
when real estate assets and related intangible assets are acquired or placed in service  they must be depreciated or amortized 
management s judgment involves determining which depreciation method to use  estimating the economic life of the building and improvement components of real estate assets  and estimating the value of intangible assets acquired when real estate assets are purchased that have in place leases 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company accounts for acquisitions of real estate properties with in place leases in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
when a building is acquired with in place leases  sfas no 
requires that the cost of the acquisition be allocated between the acquired tangible real estate assets as if vacant and any acquired intangible assets 
such intangible assets could include above or below market in place leases and at market in place leases  which could include the opportunity costs associated with absorption period rentals  direct costs associated with obtaining new leases such as tenant improvements  and customer relationship assets 
any remaining excess purchase price is then allocated to goodwill 
the identifiable tangible and intangible assets are then subject to depreciation and amortization 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis unless circumstances suggest that a more frequent evaluation is warranted 
if assumptions used to estimate the as if vacant value of the building or the intangible asset values prove to be inaccurate  the pro ration of the purchase price between building and intangibles and resulting depreciation and amortization could be incorrect 
the amortization period for the intangible assets is the average remaining term of the actual in place leases as of the acquisition date 
to help prevent errors in its estimates from occurring  management applies consistent assumptions with regard to the elements of estimating the as if vacant values of the building and the intangible assets  including the absorption period  occupancy increases during the absorption period  and tenant improvement amounts 
the company uses the same absorption period and occupancy assumptions for similar building types  adding the future cash flows expected to occur over the next years as a fully occupied building 
the net present value of these future cash flows  discounted using a market rate of return  becomes the estimated as if vacant value of the building 

table of contents with respect to the building components  there are several depreciation methods available under gaap 
some methods record relatively more depreciation expense on an asset in the early years of the asset s economic life  and relatively less depreciation expense on the asset in the later years of its economic life 
the straight line method of depreciating real estate assets is the method the company follows because  in the opinion of management  it is the method that most accurately and consistently allocates the cost of the asset over its estimated life 
the company assigns a useful life to its owned buildings based on many factors  including the age of the property when acquired 
allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses many of the company s investments are subject to long term leases or other financial support arrangements with hospital systems and healthcare providers affiliated with the properties 
due to the nature of the company s agreements  the company s accounts receivable  notes receivable and interest receivables result mainly from monthly billings of contractual tenant rents  lease guaranty amounts  principal and interest payments due on notes and mortgage notes receivable  late fees and additional rent 
accounts receivable payments on the company s accounts receivable are normally collected within days of billing 
when receivables remain uncollected  management must decide whether it believes the receivable is collectible and whether to provide an allowance for all or a portion of these receivables 
unlike a financial institution with a large volume of homogeneous retail receivables such as credit card loans or automobile loans that have a predictable loss pattern over time  the company s receivable losses have historically been infrequent and are tied to a unique or specific event 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is generally based on specific identification and is recorded for a specific receivable amount once determined that such an allowance is needed 
management monitors the age and collectibility of receivables on an ongoing basis 
at least monthly  a report is produced whereby all receivables are aged or placed into groups based on the number of days that have elapsed since the receivable was billed 
management reviews the aging report for evidence of deterioration in the timeliness of payments from tenants  sponsors or borrowers 
whenever deterioration is noted  management investigates and determines the reason s for the delay  which may include discussions with the delinquent tenant  sponsor or borrower 
considering all information gathered  management s judgment must be exercised in determining whether a receivable is potentially uncollectible and  if so  how much or what percentage may be uncollectible 
among the factors management considers in determining uncollectibility are the following type of contractual arrangement under which the receivable was recorded  eg  a mortgage note  a triple net lease  a gross lease  a sponsor guaranty agreement or some other type of agreement  tenant s or debtor s reason for slow payment  industry influences and healthcare segment under which the tenant or debtor operates  evidence of willingness and ability of the tenant or debtor to pay the receivable  credit worthiness of the tenant or debtor  collateral  security deposit  letters of credit or other monies held as security  tenant s or debtor s historical payment pattern  other contractual agreements between the tenant or debtor and the company  relationship between the tenant or debtor and the company  state in which the tenant or debtor operates  and existence of a guarantor and the willingness and ability of the guarantor to pay the receivable 

table of contents considering these factors and others  management must conclude whether all or some of the aged receivable balance is likely uncollectible 
if management determines that some portion of a receivable is likely uncollectible  the company records a provision for bad debt expense for the amount expected to be uncollectible 
there is a risk that management s estimate is over or under stated  however  management believes that this risk is mitigated by the fact that it re evaluates the allowance at least once each quarter and bases its estimates on the most current information available 
as such  any over or under stated estimates in the allowance should be adjusted for as soon as new and better information becomes available 
mortgage notes and notes receivable the company also evaluates collectibility of its mortgage notes and notes receivable and records necessary allowances on the notes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas no 
 as amended 
sfas no 
indicates that a loan is impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan as scheduled  including both contractual interest and principal payments 
the company recorded approximately million in allowances or reserves on its mortgage notes or notes receivable for the year ended december  the company did not record any provisions for doubtful accounts on its mortgage notes or notes receivable during or however  in connection with the sale of the senior living assets in  the company forgave approximately million in notes receivable which was reflected in the gain on sale in item a
