environmental compliance in addition to our obligations under environmental laws with respect to property that we own  there are several federal and state statutes that govern the rights and obligations of financial institutions with respect to environmental issues 
in addition to being directly liable under these statutes for its own conduct  a financial institution may also be held liable under certain circumstances for the actions of borrowers or other third parties on property that collateralizes a loan held by the institution 
this potential liability may far exceed the original amount of the loan made by the financial institution  which is secured by the property

supervision and regulation this following is a summary description of the relevant laws  rules and regulations governing banks and bank and financial holding companies 
the descriptions of  and references to  the statutes and regulations below are brief summaries and do not purport to be complete 
the descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the specific statutes and regulations discussed 
general the supervision and regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors  the deposit insurance funds of the fdic and the banking system as a whole  and not for the protection of the bank holding company stockholders or creditors 
the banking agencies have broad enforcement power over bank holding companies and banks  including the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of laws and regulations 
legislation is from time to time introduced in congress and puerto rico s legislature  including proposals to overhaul the bank regulatory system  expand the powers of depository institutions and limit the investments that depository institutions may make with insured funds 
such legislation may change applicable statutes and the operating environment of eurobancshares and eurobank in substantial and unpredictable ways 
we cannot determine the ultimate effect that future legislation or implementing regulations would have upon the financial condition and results of operations of eurobancshares or eurobank  or any of their subsidiaries 
on march   eurobancshares subsidiary bank  eurobank  entered into a stipulation and consent order with the fdic agreeing to the issuance of a cease and desist order 
the order was based upon examination results which indicated that the bank s bank secrecy act anti money laundering program was not fully in compliance with the requirements of the bsa laws  regulations  and guidance 
for additional information  see the section of this report captioned anti terrorism legislation on page eurobancshares eurobancshares is a financial holding company registered under the bank holding company act  and is subject to supervision  regulation and examination by the federal reserve board 
the bank holding company act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage  and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities  including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations 
regulatory restrictions on dividends  source of strength eurobancshares is regarded as a legal entity separate and distinct from its other subsidiaries 
the principal source of our revenue is dividends received from eurobank 
various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends eurobank can pay to eurobancshares without regulatory approval 
it is the policy of the federal reserve board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition 
the policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries 
under federal reserve board policy  a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of its banking subsidiaries and commit resources to their support 
such support may be required at times when  absent this federal reserve board policy  a holding company may not be inclined to provide it 
as discussed below  a bank holding company  in certain circumstances  could be required to guarantee the capital plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary 
in the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code  the trustee will be deemed to have assumed  and is required to cure immediately  any deficit under any commitment by the debtor holding company to any of the federal banking agencies to maintain the capital of an insured depository institution  and any claim for breach of such obligation will generally have priority over most other unsecured claims 
activities closely related to banking the bank holding company act prohibits a bank holding company  with certain limited exceptions  from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company which is not a bank or from engaging in any activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks and certain other subsidiaries  or furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries 
one principal exception to these prohibitions allows the acquisition of interests in companies whose activities are found by the federal reserve board  by order or regulation  to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks  as to be a proper incident thereto 
these activities include  among other things  numerous services and functions performed in connection with lending  investing  and financial counseling and tax planning 
in approving acquisitions by bank holding companies of companies engaged in banking related activities  the federal reserve board considers a number of factors  and weighs the expected benefits to the public such as greater convenience and increased competition or gains in efficiency against the risks of possible adverse effects such as undue concentration of resources  decreased or unfair competition  conflicts of interest  or unsound banking practices 
the federal reserve board is also empowered to differentiate between activities commenced de novo and activities commenced through acquisition of a going concern 
gramm leach bliley act  financial holding companies eurobancshares is a financial holding company under the gramm leach bliley financial modernization act of under the gramm leach bliley act  in order to elect and retain financial holding company status  all depository institution subsidiaries of a bank holding company must be well capitalized  well managed  and  except in limited circumstances  be in satisfactory compliance with the community reinvestment act cra 
failure to sustain compliance with these requirements or correct any non compliance within a fixed time period could lead to divestiture of subsidiary banks or require all activities to conform to those permissible for a bank holding company 
the gramm leach bliley act specifically provides that the following activities have been determined to be financial in nature lending  trust and other banking activities  insurance activities  financial or economic advisory services  securitization of assets  securities underwriting and dealing  existing bank holding company domestic activities  existing bank holding company foreign activities and merchant banking activities 
in addition  the gramm leach bliley act specifically gives the federal reserve board the authority  by regulation or order  to expand the list of financial or incidental activities  but requires consultation with the united states treasury department  and gives the federal reserve board authority to allow a financial holding company to engage in any activity that is complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
privacy policies under the gramm leach bliley act  all financial institutions are required to adopt privacy policies  restrict the sharing of nonpublic customer data with nonaffiliated parties and establish procedures and practices to protect customer data from unauthorized access 
eurobancshares and its subsidiaries have established policies and procedures to assure our compliance with all privacy provisions of the gramm leach bliley act 
safe and sound banking practices bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices 
the federal reserve board s regulation y  for example  generally requires a holding company to give the federal reserve board prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities  if the consideration to be paid  together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year  is equal to or more of the company s consolidated net worth 
the federal reserve board may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation 
depending upon the circumstances  the federal reserve board could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
the federal reserve board has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations  and can assess civil money penalties for certain activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis  if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution 
the penalties can be as high as million for each day the activity continues 
annual reporting  examinations we are required to file annual reports with the federal reserve board  and such additional information as the federal reserve board may require pursuant to the bank holding company act 
the federal reserve board may examine a bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries  and charge the company for the cost of such the examination 
capital adequacy requirements the federal reserve board has adopted a system using risk based capital guidelines to evaluate the capital adequacy of certain large bank holding companies 
prior to march   these capital guidelines were applicable to all bank holding companies having million or more in assets on a consolidated basis 
however  effective march   the federal reserve board amended the asset size threshold to million for purposes of determining whether a bank holding company is subject to the capital adequacy guidelines 
eurobancshares currently has consolidated assets in excess of million and is therefore subject to the federal reserve board s capital adequacy guidelines 
under the guidelines  specific categories of assets are assigned different risk weights  based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset 
these risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a risk weighted asset base 
the guidelines require a minimum total risk based capital ratio of of which at least is required to consist of tier capital elements 
total capital is the sum of tier and tier capital 
to be considered well capitalized  a bank holding company must maintain  on a consolidated basis  i a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and ii a total risk based capital ratio of or greater 
as of december   our tier risk based capital ratio was and its total risk based capital ratio was 
thus  eurobancshares is considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
in addition to the risk based capital guidelines  the federal reserve board uses a leverage ratio as an additional tool to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies 
the leverage ratio is a company s tier capital divided by its average total consolidated assets 
certain highly rated bank holding companies may maintain a minimum leverage ratio of  but other bank holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 
to be considered well capitalized  a bank holding company must maintain a leverage ratio of at least 
as of december   our leverage ratio was 
the federal banking agencies risk based and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria 
the federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant 
federal reserve board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions  substantially above the minimum supervisory levels  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
imposition of liability for undercapitalized subsidiaries bank regulators are required to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions whose capital declines below certain levels 
in the event an institution becomes undercapitalized  it must submit a capital restoration plan 
the capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiary s compliance with the capital restoration plan up to a certain specified amount 
any such guarantee from a depository institution s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy 
the aggregate liability of the holding company of an undercapitalized bank is limited to the lesser of of the institution s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to cause the institution to be adequately capitalized 
the bank regulators have greater power in situations where an institution becomes significantly or critically undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan 
for example  a bank holding company controlling such an institution can be required to obtain prior federal reserve board approval of proposed dividends  or might be required to consent to a consolidation or to divest the troubled institution or other affiliates 
acquisitions by bank holding companies the bank holding company act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve board before it may acquire all  or substantially all  of the assets of any bank  or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank  if after such acquisition it would own or control  directly or indirectly  more than of the voting shares of such bank 
in approving bank acquisitions by bank holding companies  the federal reserve board is required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned  the convenience and needs of the communities to be served  and various competitive factors 
control acquisitions the change in bank control act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring control of a bank holding company unless the federal reserve board has been notified and has not objected to the transaction 
under a rebuttable presumption established by the federal reserve board  the acquisition of or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under section of the exchange act would  under the circumstances set forth in the presumption  constitute acquisition of control 
in addition  any company is required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve board under the bank holding company act before acquiring in the case of an acquirer that is a bank holding company or more of the outstanding common stock of the company  or otherwise obtaining control or a controlling influence over the company 
cross guarantees under the federal deposit insurance act  or fdia  a depository institution which definition includes both banks and savings associations  the deposits of which are insured by the fdic  can be held liable for any loss incurred by  or reasonably expected to be incurred by  the fdic in connection with the default of a commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution or any assistance provided by the fdic to any commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution in danger of default 
default is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or a receiver and in danger of default is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 
in some circumstances depending upon the amount of the loss or anticipated loss suffered by the fdic  cross guarantee liability may result in the ultimate failure or insolvency of one or more insured depository institutions in a holding company structure 
any obligation or liability owed by a subsidiary bank to its parent company is subordinated to the subsidiary bank s cross guarantee liability with respect to commonly controlled insured depository institutions 
eurobank is currently the only fdic insured depository institution subsidiary of eurobancshares 
because eurobancshares is a legal entity separate and distinct from eurobank  its right to participate in the distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon the subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event of a liquidation or other resolution of eurobank  the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors of eurobank would be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of any obligation of eurobank to its shareholders  including any depository institution holding company such as eurobancshares or any shareholder or creditor of such holding company 
anti money laundering initiatives and the usa patriot act a major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions this decade has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing 
the usa patriot act of  or the usa patriot act  substantially broadened the scope of united states anti money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations  creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra territorial jurisdiction of the united states 
the us treasury department has issued a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the usa patriot act to financial institutions such as the bank 
these regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies  procedures and controls to detect  prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers 
failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing  or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations  could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution 
as previously mentioned  on march   eurobank  the wholly owned banking subsidiary of eurobancshares  inc  and the board of directors of eurobank executed and entered into  without admitting or denying the allegations  a stipulation and consent order the stipulation with the fdic agreeing to the issuance of a cease and desist order the order 
the order  which was issued by the fdic on march   was based upon the findings of a joint examination of the bank by the fdic and the commonwealth of puerto rico office of the commissioner of financial institutions 
there were no fines or civil money penalties imposed on the bank in connection with the examination findings 
the joint examination was concluded in october  and the bank signed the stipulation on march  the findings set out in the joint report of examination concluded that the bank secrecy act anti money laundering program bsa program at the bank was deficient based upon allegations of inadequate training for bank personnel  an inadequate system of independent testing for bank secrecy act compliance  failure to comply with certain recordkeeping requirements  and failure to comply completely with the rules of the office of foreign assets control 
the order contains several articles  each addressing a separate issue concerning the bsa program and its operation 
the order lays out the specific steps the bank needs to take in order to bring the bsa program back into compliance with the laws and regulations  including  among others  requirements that the bank i perform a new risk assessment of the bank s operations  ii adopt and implement new procedures for customer due diligence  iii amend its policies and procedures for identifying and monitoring high risk accounts  iv amend its procedures for monitoring currency transactions and wire transfers  v amend its policies and procedures for detecting and reporting suspicious activity  vi strengthen its customer identification program procedures  and vii ensure that it has the necessary staffing  properly trained  to manage the bsa program 
each of these requirements and the various deadlines for remediation are described in more detail in the order 
in response to the requirements of the order  management and the board of directors of the bank continue to proactively enhance its related policies and procedures designed to remediate the remaining deficiencies alleged in the order and continue to need correction or enhancements 
as part of this process  the bank has engaged a subject matter expert consultant to assist with the development and implementation of its corrective action plan 
furthermore  the bank has engaged the services of crowe horwath as a third party independent bsa auditor 
sarbanes oxley act of as a publicly traded company  we are subject to the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley act 
the principal provisions of the sarbanes oxley act  many of which have been implemented or interpreted through regulations  provide for and include  among other things i the creation of an independent accounting oversight board  ii auditor independence provisions that restrict non audit services that accountants may provide to their audit clients  iii additional corporate governance and responsibility measures  including the requirement that the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of a public company certify financial statements  iv the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer s securities by directors and senior officers in the twelve month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement  v an increase in the oversight of  and enhancement of certain requirements relating to  audit committees of public companies and how they interact with the company s independent auditors  vi requirements that audit committee members must be independent and are barred from accepting consulting  advisory or other compensatory fees from the issuer  vii requirements that companies disclose whether at least one member of the audit committee is a financial expert as such term is defined by the sec and if not discussed  why the audit committee does not have a financial expert  viii expanded disclosure requirements for corporate insiders  including accelerated reporting of stock transactions by insiders and a prohibition on insider trading during pension blackout periods  ix a prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers  except certain loans made by insured financial institutions on nonpreferential terms and in compliance with other bank regulatory requirements  x disclosure of a code of ethics and filing a form k for a change or waiver of such code  xi a range of enhanced penalties for fraud and other violations  and xii expanded disclosure and certification relating to an issuer s disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 
eurobank eurobank is subject to extensive regulation and examination by the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico and the fdic  which insures its deposits to the maximum extent permitted by law  and is subject to certain federal reserve board regulations of transactions with its affiliates 
the federal and puerto rico laws and regulations which are applicable to eurobank  regulate  among other things  the scope of its business  its investments  its reserves against deposits  the timing of the availability of deposited funds and the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans 
in addition to the impact of such regulations  commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the federal reserve board as it attempts to control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy 
transactions with affiliates there are various statutory and regulatory limitations  including those set forth in sections a and b of the federal reserve act and regulation w  governing the extent to which eurobank will be able to purchase assets from or securities of or otherwise finance or transfer funds to eurobancshares or its nonbanking subsidiaries 
among other restrictions  such transfers by eurobank to eurobancshares or any of its nonbanking subsidiaries generally will be limited to of eurobank s capital and surplus and  with respect to eurobancshares and all such nonbanking subsidiaries  to an aggregate of of eurobank s subsidiary s capital and surplus 
furthermore  loans and extensions of credit are required to be secured in specified amounts and are required to be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
in addition  any transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any sale of assets or provision of services to an affiliate generally must be on terms that are substantially the same  or at least as favorable  to the bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
loans to insiders sections g and h of the federal reserve act and its implementing regulation  regulation o  place restrictions on loans by a bank to executive officers  directors  and principal stockholders 
under section h  loans to a director  an executive officer and to a greater than stockholder of a bank and certain of their related interests  or insiders  and insiders of affiliates  may not exceed  together with all other outstanding loans to such person and related interests  the bank s loans to one borrower limit generally equal to of the institution s unimpaired capital and surplus 
section h also requires that loans to insiders and to insiders of affiliates be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons  unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that i is widely available to employees of the bank and ii does not give preference to insiders over other employees of the bank 
section h also requires prior board of directors approval for certain loans  and the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a bank to all insiders cannot exceed the institution s unimpaired capital and surplus 
furthermore  section g places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers 
dividends the ability of eurobank to pay dividends on its common stock is restricted by the puerto rico banking act of  as amended  the fdia and fdic regulations 
in general terms  the puerto rico banking act provides that when the expenditures of a bank are greater than receipts  the excess of expenditures over receipts shall be charged against the undistributed profits of the bank and the balance  if any  shall be charged against the required reserve fund of the bank 
if there is no sufficient reserve fund to cover such balance in whole or in part  the outstanding amount shall be charged against the bank s capital account 
the puerto rico banking act provides that until said capital has been restored to its original amount and the reserve fund to of the original capital  the bank may not declare any dividends 
in general terms  the fdia and the fdic regulations restrict the payment of dividends when a bank is undercapitalized  when a bank has failed to pay insurance assessments  or when there are safety and soundness concerns regarding a bank 
the payment of dividends by eurobank may also be affected by other regulatory requirements and policies  such as maintenance of adequate capital 
if  in the opinion of the regulatory authority  a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in  or is about to engage in  an unsafe or unsound practice that  depending on the financial condition of the depository institution  could include the payment of dividends  such authority may require  after notice and hearing  that such depository institution cease and desist from such practice 
the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement that provides that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of operating earnings for the current and preceding two years 
in addition  all insured depository institutions are subject to the capital based limitations required by the fdia 
fdic capital requirements eurobank is also subject to certain restrictions on the payment of dividends as a result of the requirement that it maintain adequate levels of capital in accordance with guidelines promulgated from time to time by applicable regulators 
the fdic and the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico monitor the capital adequacy of eurobank by using a combination of risk based guidelines and leverage ratios 
the agencies consider the bank s capital levels when taking action on various types of applications and when conducting supervisory activities related to the safety and soundness of individual banks and the banking system 
under the risk based capital guidelines  a risk weight factor of to is assigned to each category of assets and off balance sheet items based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset class 
the risk weights are then multiplied by the corresponding asset balances to determine a risk weighted asset base 
at least half of the risk based capital must consist of core tier capital  which is comprised of common stockholders equity includes common stock and any related surplus  undivided profits  disclosed capital reserves that represent a segregation of undivided profits  and foreign currency translation adjustments  less net unrealized losses on marketable equity securities  certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  and minority interests in the equity capital accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  and excludes goodwill  disallowed deferred tax assets  and various intangible assets 
the remainder  supplementary tier capital  may consist of allowance for loan and lease losses  up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets  certain perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  hybrid capital instruments  perpetual debt  mandatory convertible debt securities  term subordinated debt  intermediate term preferred stock  and certain unrealized holding gains on equity securities 
total risk based capital is determined by combining core capital and supplementary capital 
under the regulatory capital guidelines  eurobank must maintain a total risk based capital to risk weighted assets ratio of at least  a tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio of at least  and a tier capital to adjusted total assets ratio of at least for banks receiving the highest examination rating to be considered adequately capitalized 
see discussion in the section below captioned the fdic improvement act 
firrea the financial institutions reform  recovery and enforcement act of  or firrea  includes various provisions that affect or may affect eurobank 
among other matters  firrea generally permits bank holding companies to acquire healthy thrifts as well as failed or failing thrifts 
firrea removed certain cross marketing prohibitions previously applicable to thrift and bank subsidiaries of a common holding company 
furthermore  a multi bank holding company may now be required to indemnify the federal deposit insurance fund against losses it incurs with respect to such company s affiliated banks  which in effect makes a bank holding company s equity investments in healthy bank subsidiaries available to the fdic to assist such company s failing or failed bank subsidiaries 
in addition  pursuant to firrea  any depository institution that has been chartered less than two years  is not in compliance with the minimum capital requirements of its primary federal banking regulator  or is otherwise in a troubled condition must notify its primary federal banking regulator of the proposed addition of any person to the board of directors or the employment of any person as a senior executive officer of the institution at least days before such addition or employment becomes effective 
during such day period  the applicable federal banking regulatory agency may disapprove of the addition of employment of such director or officer 
eurobank is not subject to any such requirements 
firrea also expanded and increased civil and criminal penalties available for use by the appropriate regulatory agency against certain institution affiliated parties primarily including i management  employees and agents of a financial institution  as well as ii independent contractors such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the financial institution s affairs and who caused or are likely to cause more than minimum financial loss to or a significant adverse affect on the institution  who knowingly or recklessly violate a law or regulation  breach a fiduciary duty or engage in unsafe or unsound practices 
such practices can include the failure of an institution to timely file required reports or the submission of inaccurate reports 
furthermore  firrea authorizes the appropriate banking agency to issue cease and desist orders that may  among other things  require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice  including restitution  reimbursement  indemnifications or guarantees against loss 
a financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth  dispose of certain assets or take other action as determined by the ordering agency to be appropriate 
the fdic improvement act the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  or fdicia  made a number of reforms addressing the safety and soundness of the deposit insurance system  supervision of domestic and foreign depository institutions  and improvement of accounting standards 
this statute also limited deposit insurance coverage  implemented changes in consumer protection laws and provided for least cost resolution and prompt regulatory action with regard to troubled institutions 
fdicia requires every bank with total assets in excess of billion to have an annual independent audit made of the bank s financial statements by a certified public accountant to verify that the financial statements of the bank are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and comply with such other disclosure requirements as prescribed by the fdic 
fdicia also places certain restrictions on activities of banks depending on their level of capital 
fdicia divides banks into five different categories  depending on their level of capital 
under regulations adopted by the fdic  a bank is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a tier capital ratio of or more and a leverage ratio of or more  and the bank is not subject to an order or capital directive to meet and maintain a certain capital level 
under such regulations  a bank is deemed to be adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a tier capital ratio of or more and a leverage ratio of or more unless it receives the highest composite rating at its most recent examination and is not experiencing or anticipating significant growth  in which instance it must maintain a leverage ratio of or more 
under such regulations  a bank is deemed to be undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than 
under such regulations  a bank is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier capital ratio of less than and a leverage ratio of less than 
under such regulations  a bank is deemed to be critically undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than or equal to 
in addition  the fdic has the ability to downgrade a bank s classification but not to critically undercapitalized based on other considerations even if the bank meets the capital guidelines 
as of december   eurobank s total risk based capital ratio was  tier risk based capital ratio was  and its leverage ratio was 
according to these guidelines  eurobank was classified as well capitalized as of december  in addition  if a state non member bank is classified as undercapitalized  the bank is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the fdic 
pursuant to fdicia  an undercapitalized bank is prohibited from increasing its assets  engaging in a new line of business  acquiring any interest in any company or insured depository institution  or opening or acquiring a new branch office  except under certain circumstances  including the acceptance by the fdic of a capital restoration plan for the bank 
furthermore  if a state non member bank is classified as undercapitalized  the fdic may take certain actions to correct the capital position of the bank  if a bank is classified as significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized  the fdic would be required to take one or more prompt corrective actions 
these actions would include  among other things  requiring sales of new securities to bolster capital  improvements in management  limits on interest rates paid  prohibitions on transactions with affiliates  termination of certain risky activities and restrictions on compensation paid to executive officers 
if a bank is classified as critically undercapitalized  fdicia requires the bank to be placed into conservatorship or receivership within ninety days  unless the fdic determines that other action would better achieve the purposes of fdicia regarding prompt corrective action with respect to undercapitalized banks 
the capital classification of a bank affects the frequency of examinations of the bank and impacts the ability of the bank to engage in certain activities and affects the deposit insurance premiums paid by such bank 
under fdicia  the fdic is required to conduct a full scope  on site examination of every bank at least once every twelve months 
an exception to this rule is made  however  that provides that banks i with assets of less than million  ii are categorized as well capitalized  iii were found to be well managed and its composite rating was outstanding and iv has not been subject to a change in control during the last twelve months  need only be examined by the fdic once every eighteen months 
broker deposits under fdicia  banks may be restricted in their ability to accept broker deposits  depending on their capital classification 
well capitalized banks are permitted to accept broker deposits  but all banks that are not well capitalized could be restricted to accept such deposits 
the fdic may  on a case by case basis  permit banks that are adequately capitalized to accept broker deposits if the fdic determines that acceptance of such deposits would not constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice with respect to the bank 
deposits obtained from financial intermediaries  so called broker deposits  represented approximately of eurobank s total deposits as of december  as previously mentioned  eurobank is currently well capitalized and therefore is not subject to any limitations with respect to its broker deposits 
federal limitations on activities and investments the equity investments and activities as a principal of fdic insured state chartered banks such as eurobank are generally limited to those that are permissible for national banks 
under regulations dealing with equity investments  an insured state bank generally may not directly or indirectly acquire or retain any equity investment of a type  or in an amount  that is not permissible for a national bank 
fdic deposit insurance assessments the deposits of the bank are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund  or the dif  of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif 
the fdic utilizes a risk based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank s capital level and supervisory rating 
effective january   the fdic imposed deposit assessment rates based on the risk category of the bank 
risk category i is the lowest risk category while risk category iv is the highest risk category 
because of favorable loss experience and a healthy reserve ratio in the bank insurance fund  or the bif  of the fdic  well capitalized and well managed banks  have in recent years paid minimal premiums for fdic insurance 
with the additional deposit insurance  a deposit premium refund  in the form of credit offsets  was granted to banks that were in existence on december  and paid deposit insurance premiums prior to that date 
on october   the fdic published a restoration plan designed to replenish the deposit insurance fund over a period of five years and to increase the deposit insurance reserve ratio  which decreased to of insured deposits on june   to the statutory minimum of of insured deposits by december  in order to implement the restoration plan  the fdic proposes to change both its risk based assessment system and its base assessment rates 
for the first quarter of only  the fdic increased all fdic deposit assessment rates by basis points 
these new rates range from basis points for risk category i institutions to basis points for risk category iv institutions 
under the fdic s restoration plan  the fdic proposes to establish new initial base assessment rates that will be subject to adjustment as described below 
beginning april   the base assessment rates would range from basis points for risk category i institutions to basis points for risk category iv institutions 
changes to the risk based assessment system would include increasing premiums for institutions that rely on excessive amounts of brokered deposits  including cdars  increasing premiums for excessive use of secured liabilities  including federal home loan bank advances  lowering premiums for smaller institutions with very high capital levels  and adding financial ratios and debt issuer ratings to the premium calculations for banks with over billion in assets  while providing a reduction for their unsecured debt 
either an increase in the risk category of the eurobank or adjustments to the base assessment rates could have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
in addition  all institutions with deposits insured by the fdic are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation fico  a mixed ownership government corporation established to recapitalize a predecessor to the deposit insurance fund 
the current annualized assessment rate is basis points  or approximately basis points per quarter 
these assessments will continue until the financing corporation bonds mature in on february   the fdic proposed an emergency assessment charged to all financial institutions of of insured deposits as of june   payable on september  congress is currently considering a reduction in the amount of the emergency assessment to of insured deposits as of june  the enactment of eesa temporarily raised the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage from  to  per depositor 
the temporary increase in deposit insurance coverage became effective on october  eesa provides that the basic deposit insurance limit will return to  after december  on october   the fdic announced the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp 
the final rule was adopted on november  the fdic stated that its purpose is to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks of days or greater  thrifts  and certain holding companies  and by providing full coverage of all transaction accounts  regardless of dollar amount 
inclusion in the program was voluntary 
participating institutions are assessed fees based on a sliding scale  depending on length of maturity 
shorter term debt has a lower fee structure and longer term debt has a higher fee 
the range is from basis points on debt of days or less  and a maximum of basis points for debt with maturities of one year or longer  on an annualized basis 
a basis point surcharge is added to a participating institution s current insurance assessment in order to fully cover all transaction accounts 
eurobank elected to participate in both parts of the tlgp  and the holding company elected to participate in the senior unsecured debt portion of the program 
the amount of greater than day unsecured senior debt that is eligible for the program is limited to of the amount of such debt outstanding as of september  if there was no unsecured senior debt outstanding at september   the amount available under the program is limited to two percent of total liabilities as of september  as we did not have any unsecured senior debt outstanding as of september   the maximum amount of unsecured senior debt that can be issued under the program is limited to two percent of its total liabilities as of september   which represented approximately million as of that date 
community reinvestment act under the community reinvestment act  or cra  as implemented by the congress in  a financial institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation  consistent with its safe and sound operation  to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with the cra 
the cra requires federal examiners  in connection with the examination of a financial institution  to assess the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution 
the cra also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
eurobancshares has a compliance committee  which oversees the planning of products  and services offered to the community  especially those aimed to serve low and moderate income communities 
the fdic rated eurobank as satisfactory in meeting community credit needs under the cra at its most recent examination for cra performance 
consumer laws and regulations in addition to the laws and regulations discussed herein  eurobank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks 
while the list set forth herein is not exhaustive  these laws and regulations include the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the electronic funds transfer act  the expedited funds availability act  the equal credit opportunity act  and the fair housing act  among others 
these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers 
eurobank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing customer relations 
interstate branching effective june   the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of amended the fdia and certain other statutes to permit state and national banks with different home states to merge across state lines  with approval of the appropriate federal banking agency  unless the home state of a participating bank had passed legislation prior to may  expressly prohibiting interstate mergers 
under the riegle neal act amendments  once a state or national bank has established branches in a state  that bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state at which any bank involved in the interstate merger transaction could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law 
if a state opts out of interstate branching within the specified time period  no bank in any other state may establish a branch in the state which has opted out  whether through an acquisition or de novo 
for purposes of the riegle neal act s amendments to the fdia  eurobank is treated as a state bank and is subject to the same restrictions on interstate branching as other state banks 
however  for purposes of the international banking act of  eurobank is considered to be a foreign bank and may branch interstate by merger or de novo to the same extent as a domestic bank in eurobank s home state 
it is not yet possible to determine how these statutes will be harmonized  with respect either to which federal agency will approve interstate transactions or to which home state determination rules will apply 
eurobank currently does not have any branches outside puerto rico 
federal home loan bank system the fhlb system  of which eurobank is a member  consists of regional fhlbs governed and regulated by the federal housing finance board 
the fhlbs serve as reserve or credit facilities for member institutions within their assigned regions 
they are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
they make loans ie  advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the fhlb and the boards of directors of each regional fhlb 
as a system member  eurobank is entitled to borrow from the fhlb of new york  or fhlb ny  and is required to own capital stock in the fhlb ny in an amount equal to the greater of of the aggregate of the unpaid principal of its home mortgage loans  home purchase contracts  and similar obligations at the beginning of each fiscal year  which for this purpose is deemed to be not less than of assets or of the total amount of advances by the fhlb ny to eurobank 
eurobank is in compliance with the stock ownership rules described above with respect to such advances  commitments and letters of credit and home mortgage loans and similar obligations 
all loans  advances and other extensions of credit made by the fhlb ny to eurobank are secured by a portion of its mortgage loan portfolio  certain other investments and the capital stock of the fhlb ny held by eurobank 
mortgage banking operations eurobank is subject to the rules and regulations of fha  va  fnma  fhlmc and gnma with respect to originating  processing  selling and servicing mortgage loans and the issuance and sale of mortgage backed securities

puerto rico regulation as a commercial bank organized under the laws of puerto rico  eurobank is subject to the supervision  examination and regulation of the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico  pursuant to the puerto rico banking act of  as amended 
certain of those activities are described in this supervision and regulation section above 
puerto rico banking law section of the puerto rico banking law requires the prior approval of the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico with respect to a transfer of capital stock of a bank that results in a change of control of the bank 
under section  a change of control is presumed to occur if a person or group of persons acting in concert  directly or indirectly  acquires more than of the outstanding voting capital stock of the bank 
the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico has interpreted the restrictions of section as applying to acquisitions of voting securities of entities controlling a bank  such as a bank holding company 
under the puerto rico banking law  the determination of the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico whether to approve a change of control filing is final and non appealable 
section of the puerto rico banking law requires every bank to maintain a legal reserve which shall not be less than of its demand liabilities  except government deposits federal  state and municipal which are secured by actual collateral 
the reserve is required to be composed of any of the following securities or combination thereof legal tender of the united states  checks on banks or trust companies located in any part of puerto rico  to be presented for collection during the day following that on which they are received  money deposited in other banks or depository institutions  subject to immediate collection  federal funds sold to any federal reserve bank and securities purchased under agreement to resell executed by the bank with such funds that are subject to be repaid to the bank on or before the close of the next business day and any other asset that the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico determines from time to time 
section of the puerto rico banking law permits puerto rico commercial banks to make unsecured loans to any one person  firm  partnership or corporation  up to an aggregate amount of the sum of i paid in capital  ii reserve fund of the commercial bank  iii of the commercial bank s retained earnings and iv any other components that the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico may determine from time to time 
as of december   the legal lending limit for eurobank under this provision was approximately million 
if such loans are secured by collateral worth at least more than the amount of the loan  the aggregate maximum amount may reach one third of the sum of eurobank s paid in capital  reserve fund  of retained earnings and any other components that the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico may determine from time to time 
as of december   the legal lending limit for eurobank under this provision was approximately million 
there are no restrictions under section of the puerto rico banking law on the amount of loans which are fully secured by bonds  securities and other evidences of indebtedness of the government of the united states  of the commonwealth of puerto rico  or by bonds  not in default  of authorities  instrumentalities or dependencies of the commonwealth of puerto rico or its municipalities 
section of the puerto rico banking law also prohibits puerto rico commercial banks from making loans secured by their own stock and from purchasing their own stock  unless such purchase is necessary to prevent losses because of a debt previously contracted in good faith 
the stock so purchased by the puerto rico commercial bank must be sold by the bank in a public or private sale within one year from the date of purchase 
section of the puerto rico banking law also requires that at least of the yearly net income of a puerto rico commercial bank be credited to a reserve fund until the amount deposited to the credit of the reserve fund is equal to of total paid in capital common and preferred of the commercial bank 
as of december   eurobank had million in its reserve fund 
section of the puerto rico banking law also provides that when the expenditures of a puerto rico commercial bank are greater than receipts  the excess of the expenditures over receipts shall be charged against the undistributed profits of the bank  and the balance  if any  shall be charged against the reserve fund  as a reduction thereof 
if there is no reserve fund sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part  the outstanding amount shall be charged against the capital account and no dividends shall be declared until said capital has been restored to its original amount and the reserve fund to of the original capital of the bank 
section of the puerto rico banking law authorizes eurobank to conduct certain financial and related activities directly or through subsidiaries  including lease financing of personal property  operating small loans companies and mortgage loans activities 
in  eurobank organized an international banking entity ibe subsidiary  ebs overseas 
puerto rico usury law the rate of interest that eurobank may charge on real estate and other types of loans to individuals in puerto rico is subject to puerto rico s usury law 
that law is administered by the finance board  which consists of the secretaries of the treasury  commerce and consumer affairs departments  the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico  the president of the planning board  the president of the government development bank for puerto rico  the secretary of economic development and commerce department and a representative of the private financial industry 
the finance board promulgates regulations which specify maximum rates on various types of loans to individuals and revises those regulations periodically as general interest rates change 
among the most important regulations enforced on interest rates are regulations  and pursuant to regulation  there is no limitation on interest rates that may be charged on small personal loans 
the same rule applies to retail installment sale contracts and credit card loans as provided by regulation the rates on these loans are established as a result of the market and competition 
interest rates that may be charged on personal loans  personal lines of credit  cash advances on credit cards  commercial loans or commercial lines of credit and residential and commercial mortgage loans are not restricted by regulation the rates on these loans are established as a result of the market and competition 
regulation does establish restrictions on prepayment penalties and late charges for all loans  except commercial loans 
international banking center regulatory act the business and operations of our international banking entities ibes are subject to supervision and regulation by the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico 
under the ibe act  no sale  encumbrance  assignment  merger  exchange or transfer of shares  interest or participation in the capital of an ibe may be initiated without the prior approval of the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico  if by such transaction a person would acquire  directly or indirectly  control of or more of any class of stock  interest or participation in the capital of the ibe 
the ibe act and the regulations issued thereunder by the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico limit the business activities that may be carried out by an ibe 
such activities are limited in part to persons and assets located outside of puerto rico 
the ibe act provides further that every ibe must have not less than  of unencumbered assets or acceptable financial guarantees 
pursuant to the ibe act and the ibe regulations  our ibes must maintain books and records of all their transactions in the ordinary course of business 
the ibes are also required to submit to the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico quarterly and annual reports of their financial condition and results of operations  including annual audited financial statements for ebs overseas  inc the ibe act empowers the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico to revoke or suspend  after notice and hearing  a license issued thereunder if  among other things  the ibe fails to comply with the ibe act  the ibe regulations or the terms of its license  or if the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico finds that the business or affairs of the ibe are conducted in a manner that is not consistent with the public interest 
ibes generally are exempt from taxation under united states federal law and puerto rico law 
the legislature of puerto rico and the governor of puerto rico approved a law amending the ibe act 
this law imposes income taxes at normal statutory rates on each ibe that operates as a unit of a bank  if the ibe s net income generated after december  exceeds of the bank s net income in the taxable year commenced on july   of the bank s net income in the taxable year commencing on july   and of the bank s net income in the taxable year commencing on july   and thereafter 
it does not impose income taxation on an ibe that operates as a subsidiary of a bank 
thus  only ebs international bank  which operates as a division of eurobank rather than a subsidiary  is impacted by the new law 
however  we cannot give any assurance that the ibe act will not be modified in the future in a manner to reduce the tax benefits available to ebs overseas 
a reduction of such tax benefits may reduce our earnings 
euroseguros  inc euroseguros is a wholly owned subsidiary of eurobancshares and is registered as a corporate agent and general agency with the office of the commissioner of insurance of the commonwealth of puerto rico 
euroseguros is subject to regulation by the commissioner of insurance relating to  among other things  licensing of employees  sales practices  charging of commissions and obligations to customers 
future legislation and economic policy management of eurobancshares and eurobank cannot predict what other legislation or economic and monetary policies of the various regulatory authorities might be enacted or adopted or what other regulations might be adopted or the effects thereof 
future legislation and policies and the effects thereof might have a significant influence on overall growth and distribution of loans  investments and deposits and affect interest rates charged on loans or paid from time and savings deposits 
such legislation and policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
item a 
risk factors 
the following risk factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us  and you should not place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements 
any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
new factors emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for us to predict which will arise 
in addition  we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
risks relating to the economic environment the unprecedented levels of market volatility may adversely impact our ability to access capital or our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets have reached unprecedented levels  adversely impacting the stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers  often without regard to their financial capabilities 
if the current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or further deteriorate  our ability to access capital or our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by current conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally 
negative developments in the financial services industry have resulted in uncertainty in the financial markets in general and a related general economic downturn 
in addition  as a consequence of the recession in the united states  beginning in the latter half of business activity across a wide range of industries faces serious difficulties due to the lack of consumer spending and the extreme lack of liquidity in the global credit markets 
unemployment has also increased significantly 
as a result of these financial economic crises  many lending institutions  including us  have experienced declines in the performance of their loans  including construction and land development loans  residential real estate loans  and commercial real estate loans and consumer loans 
moreover  competition among depository institutions for deposits and quality loans has increased significantly 
in addition  the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages have declined and may continue to decline 
bank and bank holding company stock prices have been negatively affected 
in addition  the ability of banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets has become more difficult compared to recent years 
as a result  there is a potential for new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards  and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations  including the expected issuance of many formal or informal enforcement actions or orders 
the impact of new legislation in response to those developments may negatively impact our operations by restricting our business operations  including our ability to originate loans  and adversely impact our financial performance or our stock price 
in addition  further negative market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which may impact our charge offs and provision for credit losses 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial services industry 
overall  during the past year  the general business environment has had an adverse effect on our business  and there can be no assurance that the environment will improve in the near term 
until conditions improve  we expect our business  financial condition and results of operations to be adversely affected 
further downturn in our real estate markets could hurt our business 
substantially all of our real estate loans are located in puerto rico 
while we do not have any subprime loans  our construction and development and residential real estate loan portfolios  along with our commercial real estate loan portfolio and certain of our other loans  have been affected by the recent downturn in the residential and commercial real estate market 
real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by changes in national  regional or local economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers  changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes  regulations and policies and acts of nature 
we anticipate that further declines in the real estate markets in our primary market areas would affect our business 
if real estate values continue to decline  the collateral for our loans will provide less security 
as a result  our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate will be diminished  and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans 
the events and conditions described in this risk factor could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
since mid  the financial services industry as a whole  as well as the securities markets generally  have been materially and adversely affected by very significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a very serious lack of liquidity 
financial institutions in particular have been subject to increased volatility and an overall loss in investor confidence 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
we have exposure to different industries and counterparties  and we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  and other institutional clients 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more financial services companies  or the financial services industry generally  have led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
there is no assurance that any such losses or defaults would not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the recently enacted emergency economic stabilization act of and other recently enacted government programs will help stabilize the us financial system 
on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was enacted 
the us treasury and banking regulators are implementing a number of programs under this legislation and otherwise to address capital and liquidity issues in the banking system  including the troubled assets relief program capital purchase program  and the capital assistance program 
in addition  other regulators have taken steps to attempt to stabilize and add liquidity to the financial markets  such as the fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program tlg program  in which we are a participant 
however  there can be no assurance that we will issue any guaranteed debt under the tlg program  or that we will participate in any other stabilization programs in the future 
there can also be no assurance as to the actual impact that the eesa and other programs will have on the financial markets  including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced 
the failure of the eesa and other programs to stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and access to credit or the trading price of our common stock 
the eesa is relatively new legislation and  as such  is subject to change and evolving interpretation 
this is particularly true given the change in administration that occurred on january  there can be no assurances as to the effects that such changes will have on the effectiveness of the eesa or on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the prolonged economic crisis in puerto rico could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
the prolonged period of reduced economic growth or recession has had an adverse effect on delinquencies  the quality of our loan and corporate bond portfolios 
during a prolonged economic downturn  affected borrowers may  among other things  be less likely to repay interest and principal on their loans or bonds as scheduled 
moreover  the value of real estate or other collateral that secures the loans and bonds could continue to be adversely affected by the prolonged economic downturn 
if this prolonged economic slowdown persists  aforementioned adverse effects may continue and would likely result in  among other things  a reduction in loan originations  increased delinquency rates  increased non performing assets  foreclosures and loan loss provisions  adversely impacting our profitability 
risks relating to our business our financial results are constantly exposed to the market risk 
as a traditional commercial bank  eurobank  our wholly owned banking subsidiary  earns interest on loans  leases and investment securities that are funded by customer deposits  borrowings  retained earnings and equity 
the difference between the interest received and the interest paid has historically comprised the majority of our earnings 
depending on the maturity and repricing characteristics of the assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items  changes in interest rates could either increase or decrease our net interest income 
during the last fourteen months  changes in the interbank borrowing rates by the board of governors of the federal reserve have resulted in a basis points reduction of the prime rate 
as of december   approximately of our non consumer loan portfolio was comprised of floating rate loans  most of them tied to the prime rate 
decreases in interest rates may result in a reduced interest income in the short term  while depositors will likely continue to expect a reasonable rate on their deposit accounts  probably resulting in a further margin compression 
the future outlook on interest rates and their impact on our interest income  interest expense and net interest income is uncertain 
our decisions regarding credit risk could be inaccurate  and our allowance for loan and lease losses may be inadequate  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
our loan and lease portfolio and investments in marketable securities subject us to credit risk 
inherent risks in lending also include fluctuations in collateral values and economic downturns 
making loans and leases is an essential element of our business  and there is a risk that our loans and leases will not be repaid 
as of december   our nonperforming assets amounted to million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we attempt to maintain an appropriate allowance for loan and lease losses to provide for losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio 
as of december   our allowance for loan and lease losses totaled million  which represents approximately of our total loans and leases 
there is no precise method of predicting loan and lease losses  and therefore  we always face the risk that charge offs in future periods will exceed our allowance for loan and lease losses and that we would need to make additional provisions to our allowance for loan and lease losses 
for the general portion of our allowance  we follow a consistent procedural discipline and account for loan and lease loss contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
this estimated allowance is based on historical loss experiences as adjusted for changes in trends and conditions on at least an annual basis 
also  another component is used in the evaluation of the adequacy of our general allowance to measure the probable effect that current internal and external environmental factors could have on the historical loss factors currently in use 
in addition to our general portfolio allowances  specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a credit that management believes indicate a high probability that a loss have been incurred 
these specific allowances are determined following a consistent procedural discipline in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
for impaired commercial and construction business relationships with aggregate balances exceeding  we measure the impairment following the guidance of sfas no 
while our allowance for loan and lease losses is established in different portfolio components  we maintain an allowance that we believe is sufficient to absorb all credit losses inherent in our portfolio 
notwithstanding these procedures  our allowance may prove to be inadequate  causing us to establish additional reserves 
in addition  we follow supervisory guidance included in the interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the fdic as well as the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require us to establish additional reserves 
additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses will result in a decrease in our net earnings and capital and could hinder our ability to grow our assets 
we have a concentration of exposure to a number of individual borrowers  and a significant loss on any one of these credits could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
under applicable law  there are quantitative limitations on the amount of loans we can make to one borrower or a group of related borrowers 
as of december   our legal lending limit was approximately million in the unsecured category and approximately million in the secured category 
as of december   we had individual borrowers with a loan principal balance of more than million and less than million per borrower  and another individual borrowers with a loan principal balance of more than million per borrower 
given the size of these current outstanding loans relative to our capital levels and earnings  a significant loss on any one of these credits could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
a significant portion of our leases are secured by automobiles  and the loss of purchasers for our leases or a downturn in automobile purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
a significant portion of our leases are secured by automobiles 
as of december   the total amount of automobile leases was million or of our total leasing portfolio 
we sometimes sell our leases to other financial institutions in order to manage our lease financing concentration 
the loss of purchasers of our leases could cause us to reduce our lease originations  reducing our net income 
alternatively  we may increase the portion of the leases that we retain for our portfolio with the result that our exposure to automobile leases will increase 
in addition  a downturn in automobile purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
we rely heavily on short term funding sources to meet our liquidity needs  such as broker deposits and repurchase obligations  which are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates and can be adversely affected by local and general economic conditions 
we have frequently utilized as a source of funds certificates of deposit obtained through deposit brokers that solicit funds from their customers for deposit with us  or broker deposits 
broker deposits  when compared to retail deposits attracted through a branch network  are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates and volatility in the capital markets  which may force us to pay above market interest rates to retain these deposits  reducing our net interest spread and net interest margin 
in addition  broker deposit funding sources may be more sensitive to significant changes in our financial condition 
as of december   broker deposits amounted to billion  or approximately of our total deposits  compared to billion and billion  or approximately and of our total deposits  as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   approximately million in broker deposits  or approximately of our total broker deposits  mature within one year 
our ability to continue to acquire broker deposits is subject to our ability to price these deposits at competitive levels  which may substantially increase our funding costs  and the confidence of the market 
in addition  if our capital ratios fall below the levels necessary to be considered well capitalized under current regulatory guidelines  we could be restricted in using broker deposits as a short term funding source 
section of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdia limits the use of brokered deposits by institutions that are less than well capitalized and allows the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to place restrictions on interest rates that institutions may pay 
on february   the fdic released a proposed rule to implement new interest rate restrictions on institutions that are not well capitalized 
the proposed rule would limit the interest rate paid by such institutions to basis points above a national rate  as derived from the interest rate average of all institutions 
if an institution could provide evidence that its local rate is higher  it would be permitted to offer the higher local rate plus basis points 
although we continue to be well capitalized  these restrictions  if they become applicable  could materially impact our ability to generate sufficient deposits to maintain an adequate liquidity position 
we also have borrowings in the form of repurchase obligations with the federal home loan bank  or the fhlb  and other broker dealers 
these agreements are collateralized by some of our investment securities 
as of december   our repurchase obligations totaled million  of which million  or approximately of the total repurchase obligations  mature within one year 
if we are unable to borrow in the form of repurchase obligations  we may be required to seek higher cost funding sources  which could materially and adversely affect our net interest income 
we have experienced rapid growth in recent years  and we may be unable to successfully continue to implement our growth strategy  which may adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
our assets have grown rapidly in recent years 
with the ultimate goal of increasing net income  we have grown our assets from billion as of december  to billion as of december  the types of assets on our balance sheet that have experienced the largest categorical increases are commercial loans and investments 
we have funded this growth  in part  with broker deposits  fhlb advances  and other borrowings 
these types of funds are generally more costly and volatile than traditional retail deposits 
we may not be able to sustain our current growth rate 
throughout our expansion  we have been successful in attracting new customers  expanding new services to existing customers  adding new business lines  engaging in acquisitions and increasing our deposit base 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue this trend  and it will become more difficult to maintain sustained growth as we increase in size 
our ability to implement our strategy for continued growth depends on our ability to attract and retain customers in a highly competitive market  on the growth of those customers businesses  on entering and expanding in lines of business in which we do not have significant past experience or for which we have only recently added personnel with the requisite experience  on our ability to continue to identify new acquisition targets and on our ability to increase our deposit base 
many of these growth prerequisites may be affected by circumstances that are beyond our control 
our inability to meet any of these growth prerequisites could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
we rely heavily on our management team and the unexpected loss of key officers could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
our success has been and will continue to be greatly influenced by our ability to retain the services of existing senior management and  as we expand  to attract and retain qualified additional senior and middle management 
rafael arrillaga torr ns  jr  our president and chief executive officer  has been instrumental in managing our business affairs 
our other senior executive officers have had  and will continue to have  a significant role in the development and management of our business 
the loss of the services of any of our senior executive officers could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
we have not established a detailed management succession plan 
accordingly  should we lose the services of any of our senior executive officers  our board of directors may have to search outside of eurobancshares for a qualified permanent replacement 
this search may be prolonged  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate and hire a qualified replacement 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our senior executive officers 
we currently do not have any employment agreements with our senior executive officers  with the exception of a change in control agreement with rafael arrillaga torr ns  jr  our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  yadira r 
mercado  our executive vice president and chief financial officer  and luis j 
berr os l pez  our executive vice president and chief lending officer 
if any of our senior executive officers leaves his or her respective position  our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects may suffer 
the regulatory capital treatment of our junior subordinated debentures and related trust preferred securities is uncertain 
financial holding companies with more than billion in assets  like us  must maintain minimum consolidated capital ratios 
in particular  we must maintain  at least  a leverage ratio of tier capital to average assets of  a tier risk based capital ratio of of risk weighted assets  and a total risk based capital ratio tier and tier capital of of risk weighted assets to be considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
the federal reserve board s current rules regarding the capital treatment of trust preferred securities allow us to count trust preferred securities as tier capital up to of our total tier capital for regulatory purposes 
the remaining portion counts as tier capital 
on march   the federal reserve board adopted the final rule that allows the continued limited inclusion of trust preferred securities in the tier capital of bank holding companies bhcs 
under the final rule  trust preferred securities and other restricted core capital elements would be subject to stricter quantitative limits 
the federal reserve board s final rule limits restricted core capital elements to of all core capital elements  net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
amounts of restricted core capital elements in excess of these limits generally may be included in tier capital 
the final rule provides a five year transition period  ending march   for application of the quantitative limits 
as of december   we had million in trust preferred securities of which all counted as tier capital 
a determination by the federal reserve board not to continue to allow the inclusion of our junior subordinated debentures or the trust preferred securities in tier capital  or otherwise limiting the inclusion of such debentures or securities in tier capital  could have a material and adverse impact on our regulatory capital levels and cause our capital ratios to fall below the levels necessary to be considered well capitalized under current regulatory guidelines 
this could impact our ability to grow our assets 
in addition  inadequate regulatory capital levels may result in the imposition of certain operating restrictions on us and eurobank  including restrictions in using broker deposits as a short term funding source 
eurobank entered into a cease and desist order with the fdic regarding its compliance with anti money laundering laws and the bank secrecy act 
on march   the board of directors of the bank  the wholly owned banking subsidiary of eurobancshares  consented to the issuance of a cease and desist order by the federal deposit insurance corporation based upon the findings of the fdic and the commonwealth of puerto rico office of the commissioner of financial institutions relating to deficiencies in the bank s bank secrecy act anti money laundering compliance program 
under the terms of the fdic order  the bank is required to make specific improvements to its anti money laundering and bank secrecy act compliance activities 
while eurobank believes that it will be able to implement effective compliance procedures necessary to remediate the deficiencies identified in the fdic order  in the event that eurobank is unable to satisfy the requirements imposed by the fdic order  eurobank may become subject to monetary fines and penalties as well as additional restrictions on its banking operations  which could affect its ability to execute certain aspects of its business plan 
such measures could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
risks relating to an investment in our common stock the price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly 
the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuation in response to numerous factors  including variations in our annual or quarterly financial results or those of our competitors  changes by financial research analysts in their evaluation of our financial results or those of our competitors  or our failure or that of our competitors to meet such estimates  conditions in the economy in general or the banking industry in particular  or unfavorable publicity affecting us or the banking industry 
the equity markets  in general  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies securities and have been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
these fluctuations may adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock 
nasdaq may cease to list our common stock  which may cause the value of an investment in our company to substantially decrease 
the bid price of our common stock fell below per share on february   which is the minimum bid price required to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq global select market 
in the event that the bid price of our common stock remains below per share for a period of consecutive trading days  nasdaq will issue a letter of non compliance that will provide us with up to calendar days to regain compliance with the listing requirements 
we are susceptible to volatility of our stock and could remain out of compliance if appropriate steps are not taken to cure our non compliance 
in the event that we receive such a notification from nasdaq and it appears that the minimum bid price of our common stock will not exceed per share within the applicable compliance period  we may seek to effect a reverse stock split for the purpose of regaining compliance 
any proposal to pursue a reverse stock split would be subject to shareholder approval 
we can give no assurances that the steps we propose will be approved by our stockholders or that they will be effective in curing our non compliance 
in addition  we may not meet other nasdaq global select market continued listing requirements  which could result in our common stock being delisted from the nasdaq global select market 
delisting from the nasdaq global select market might adversely affect the trading price and limit the liquidity of our common stock and therefore may cause the value of an investment in our company to decrease 
our executive officers and directors own a significant number of shares of our common stock  allowing management to significant control over our corporate affairs 
as of december   our executive officers and directors beneficially own of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
accordingly  these executive officers and directors will be able to control  to a significant extent  the outcome of all matters required to be submitted to our stockholders for approval  including decisions relating to the election of directors  the determination of our day to day corporate and management policies and other significant corporate transactions 
your share ownership may be diluted by the issuance of additional shares of our common stock in the future 
your share ownership may be diluted by the issuance of additional shares of our common stock in the future 
first  we have adopted a stock option plan that provides for the granting of stock options to our directors  executive officers and other employees 
as of december    shares of our common stock were issuable under options granted in connection with our stock option plans 
in addition   shares of our common stock are reserved for future issuance to directors  officers and employees under our stock option plan 
it is probable that the stock options will be exercised during their respective terms if the fair market value of our common stock exceeds the exercise price of the particular option 
if the stock options are exercised  your share ownership will be diluted 
in addition  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of common stock  but does not provide for preemptive rights to the holders of our common stock 
any authorized but unissued shares are available for issuance by our board of directors 
as a result  if we issue additional shares of common stock to raise additional capital or for other corporate purposes  you may be unable to maintain your pro rata ownership in eurobancshares 
future sales of common stock by existing stockholders may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that large sales could occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or limit our future ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities 
as of december   there were  shares of our common stock outstanding  which are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the federal securities laws unless purchased or sold by our affiliates within the meaning of rule under the securities act 
holders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our stockholders 
on december   we issued million of floating rate junior subordinated interest debentures in connection with a million trust preferred securities issuance by our subsidiary  eurobank statutory trust ii 
the junior subordinated debentures mature in the purpose of this transaction was to raise additional capital to fund our continued growth 
payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities of eurobank statutory trust ii are conditionally guaranteed by us 
the junior subordinated debentures are senior to our shares of common stock 
as a result  we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and  in the event of our bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock 
we have the right to defer distributions on the junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities for up to five years  during which time no dividends may be paid on our common stock 
holders of our series a preferred stock have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 
in connection with our acquisition of banktrust  we issued  shares in the amount of million of our series a preferred stock to certain stockholders of banktrust in exchange for their shares of the series a and series b preferred stock of banktrust 
our series a preferred stock has rights and preferences that could adversely affect holders of our common stock 
for example  we generally are unable to declare and pay dividends on our common stock if there are any accrued and unpaid dividends on our series a preferred stock for the preceding twelve months 
additionally  upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation  dissolution  or winding up of our business  the holders of our series a preferred stock are entitled to receive distributions out of our available assets before any distributions can be made to holders of our common stock 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could delay  defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us  despite the possible benefit to our stockholders  or could otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock 
for example  our bylaws contain advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings 
we also have a staggered board of directors  which means that only one third of our board of directors can be replaced by stockholders at any annual meeting 
we currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock 
in addition  our future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions 
as a result  capital appreciation  if any  of our common stock will be your sole source of gains for the foreseeable future 
we have not historically and we currently do not intend to pay any dividends on our common stock 
in addition  since we are a financial holding company with no significant assets other than eurobank  we have no material source of income other than dividends that we receive from eurobank 
therefore  our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders will depend on eurobank s ability to pay dividends to us 
moreover  banks and bank holding companies are both subject to federal and puerto rico regulatory restrictions on the payment of cash dividends 
we intend to retain the earnings of eurobank to support growth and build equity capital 
accordingly  you should not expect to receive dividends from us in the foreseeable future 
we are also restricted from paying dividends on our common stock if we have deferred payments of the interest on  or an event of default has occurred with respect to  our junior subordinated debentures 
in addition  we generally are unable to declare and pay dividends on our common stock if there are any accrued and unpaid dividends on our series a preferred stock for the preceding months 
shares of our common stock are not insured deposits 
an investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the fdic or any other government agency 
an investment in our common stock is subject to investment risk  and an investor must be capable of affording the loss of his or her entire investment 
risks related to united states taxation if we or any of our subsidiaries are determined to be a passive foreign investment company  us holders of our stock could be subject to adverse tax consequences 
if we or any of our subsidiaries are determined to be a passive foreign investment company  known as a pfic  us holders could be subject to adverse united states federal income tax consequences 
specifically  if either we or any of our subsidiaries are determined to be a pfic for any taxable year  each us holder would generally be subject to taxation under special rules  regardless of whether we or any of our subsidiaries remains a pfic  with respect to any excess distribution made by us to the us holders during that taxable year  and any gain realized on the sale  pledge or other disposition during that taxable year of our common stock or the stock of the subsidiary that was determined to be a pfic 
these rules could  in addition to other consequences  cause certain income otherwise classified as capital gain to be taxed at ordinary income rates or the highest rate of tax for ordinary income in the year to which it is allocated regardless of the us holder s particular tax situation and cause the us holder to be subject to an interest charge on the deemed deferred amount at the underpayment rate 
excess distributions generally are any distributions received by the us holder on the common stock in a taxable year that exceed of the average annual distributions received by the us holder in the three preceding taxable years  or the us holder s holding period for the common stock  if shorter 
we believe that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries will be determined to be a pfic in our current taxable year  and we expect to continue to conduct our affairs in a manner so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries qualifies as a pfic in the foreseeable future 
however  we have not requested or received an opinion from our united states tax counsel as to whether we will be determined to be a pfic in our current taxable year and we can give no assurance in this regard

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
executive overview introduction we are a diversified financial holding company headquartered in san juan  puerto rico  offering a broad array of financial services through our wholly owned banking subsidiary  eurobank  and our wholly owned insurance agency subsidiary  euroseguros 
as of december   we had  on a consolidated basis  total assets of billion  net loans and leases of billion  total investments of million  total deposits of billion  other borrowings of million  and stockholders equity of million 
we currently operate through a network of branch offices located throughout puerto rico 
our management team has implemented a strategy of building our core banking franchise by focusing on commercial loans  our investment portfolio  business transaction accounts  and the mortgage business 
we believe that this strategy will increase recurring revenue streams  enhance profitability  broaden our product and service offerings and continue to build stockholder value 
key performance indicators we believe the following were key indicators of our performance and results of operations in our total assets grew to billion at the end of  representing an increase of  from billion at the end of our net loans and leases decreased to billion at the end of  representing a decrease of  from billion at the end of  resulting primarily from our decision to strategically pare back our automobile leasing operations  including the sale of million in lease financing contracts in march  our investment securities grew to million at the end of  representing an increase of  from million at the end of our total deposits grew to billion at the end of  representing an increase of  from billion at the end of our short term borrowings increased to million  representing an increase of  from million at the end of  our nonperforming assets increased to million  or by  in  from million at the end of  our total revenue decreased to million in  representing a decrease of  from million in  our net interest margin and spread on a fully taxable equivalent basis was and in  respectively  compared to and in  our provision for loan and lease losses grew to million in  representing an increase of  from million in  our total noninterest income grew to million in  representing an increase of  from million in  our total noninterest expense grew to million in  representing an increase of  from million in  and for  we recorded a tax benefit of million  compared to an income tax benefit of  for these items  as well as other factors  resulted in a net loss for of million  compared to a net income of million in  or a loss of per common share for  compared to earnings of per common share for  assuming dilution 
financial results for the year ended december  when compared to year were predominantly impacted by an increase of million in the provision for loan and lease losses and a decrease of million in the net interest income 
the increase in our provision for loan and lease losses was primarily related to our commercial and construction loan portfolios  which reported further deterioration due to current economic conditions requiring some of them to be classified as impaired loans under sfas no 
or an increase in their specific allowances 
the decrease in our net interest income was mainly due to the interest rate cuts by the federal reserve accompanied by increased average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities  and an increase in nonaccrual loans 
these items are discussed in further detail throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a description of our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
loans and allowance for loan and lease losses loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future  or until maturity or payoff  are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balances adjusted by any charge offs  unearned finance charges  allowance for loan and lease losses  and net deferred nonrefundable fees or costs on origination 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is an estimate to provide for probable losses that have been incurred in our loan and lease portfolio 
losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the allowance account at the time a loss is incurred or a recovery is received 
the allowance for loan and lease losses amounted to million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
losses charged to the allowance amounted to million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
recoveries were credited to the allowance in the amounts of million  million and million for those same periods  respectively 
for additional information on the allowance for loan and lease losses  see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned allowance for loan and lease losses and note i loans and allowance for loan and lease losses to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
servicing assets we have no contracts to service loans for others  except for servicing rights retained on lease sales 
the total cost of loans or leases to be sold with servicing assets retained is allocated to the servicing assets and the loans or leases without the servicing assets  based on their relative fair values 
servicing assets are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing income 
in addition  we assess capitalized servicing assets for impairment based on the fair value of those assets 
to estimate the fair value of servicing assets we consider prices for similar assets and the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the servicing assets calculated using assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future servicing income and expense  including discount rates  anticipated prepayment and credit loss rates 
for purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment of capitalized servicing assets  we evaluate separately servicing retained for each loan portfolio sold 
the amount of impairment recognized  if any  is the amount by which the capitalized servicing assets exceed its estimated fair value 
impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance with changes included in current operations for the period in which the change occurs 
as of december   we utilized the following key assumptions for the impairment analysis of the servicing assets related to the sale of lease financing contracts completed in march prepayment rate of  weighted average live of years  and a discount rate of 
this impairment analysis revealed that there was no impairment 
there was no sale of lease financing contracts during servicing assets are included as part of other assets in the balance sheets 
servicing assets book value amounted to million   and  as of december   and  respectively 
servicing assets as of december  and were related to lease financing contracts sold in or before other real estate owned and repossessed assets other real estate owned  or oreo  and repossessed assets  normally obtained through foreclosure or other workout situations  are initially recorded at the lower of net realizable value or book value at the date of foreclosure  establishing a new cost basis 
any resulting loss is charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
appraisals of other real estate properties are made periodically after their acquisition  as necessary 
valuations of repossessed assets are made periodically after their acquisition 
for oreo and repossessed assets  a comparison between the appraised value and the carrying value is performed 
additional declines in value after acquisition  if any  are charged to current operations 
gains or losses on disposition of oreo and repossessed assets  and related operating income and maintenance expenses  are included in current operations 
other real estate owned amounted to million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
other repossessed assets amounted to million  million and million for those same periods  respectively 
other repossessed assets are mainly comprised of vehicles from our leasing operation and boats from our marine loans portfolio 
we monitor the total loss ratio on sale of repossessed assets  which is determined by dividing the sum of declines in value  repairs and gain or loss on sale by the book value of repossessed assets sold at the time of repossession 
repossessed vehicles amounted to million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
the total loss ratio on sale of repossessed vehicles was  and for those same years  respectively 
these increases in our total loss ratio on the sale of repossessed vehicles were directly attributable to our decision of being more aggressive in the sale of repossessed vehicles in an effort to expedite the disposition of inventory 
during  we sold  vehicles and repossessed  vehicles  moving our inventory of repossessed vehicles to units as of december   from units as of december   after selling  vehicles and repossessing  vehicles  from units in inventory as of december  during  the increase in our total loss ratio on the sale of repossessed vehicles was directly attributable to our strategy of being more aggressive in the sale of repossessed vehicles in an attempt to expedite the disposition of slow moving inventory 
this strategy resulted in an increase of approximately in the number of repossessed vehicles in inventory over six months that were sold during  when compared to during  we sold units in inventory over six months  compared to units in inventory over six months sold during repossessed equipment amounted to   and  as of december   and  respectively

investment securities we review the investment portfolio based on the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity  and the eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets 
these analyses are performed taking into consideration current us market conditions  projected cash flows and the present value of the projected cash flows 
declines in fair value of securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary result in an impairment that is charged to operations and a new cost basis for the security is established 
to determine whether an impairment is other than temporary  we consider whether it has the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery or maturity and considers whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary 
evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in value subsequent to year end and forecasted performance of the investee 
premiums and discounts are amortized over the estimated average life of the related investment security available for sale as an adjustment to yield using a method that approximates the interest method 
additionally  we anticipate estimated prepayments on mortgage backed securities in the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on such securities

results of operations for the years ended december   and net interest income and net interest margin net interest income  our principal source of earnings  is the difference between interest income  principally from loan  lease and investment securities portfolios  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income was million during the year december   compared to million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december   representing a decrease of million  or in  and a million increase  or  in the decrease in net interest income during was mainly driven by the net effect of decreased yields and cost of funds resulting from interest rate cuts by the federal reserve accompanied by increased average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities  and an increase in nonaccrual loans  as explained further below 
during  the increase in net interest income resulted from the net effect of an increase in average interest earning assets and increased yields from higher interest rates  and an increase in average interest bearing liabilities and increased cost of funds 
these changes in rates and volumes are shown on table on page total interest income decreased by to million in  compared to million in  and million in the average interest yield earned on a fully taxable equivalent basis on interest earning assets decreased to in  from in and in the decrease in the average interest yield on a fully taxable equivalent basis during was mainly attributable to the net effect of decreased loan yields resulting from interest rate cuts of basis points during the last four months of  and additional rate cuts of basis points in march  basis points in may  and basis points during the fourth quarter of  while average net loans during decreased when compared to these interest rate cuts negatively impacted average yields on our commercial and construction loans since a significant portion of these portfolios were variable rate loans 
as of december  and  approximately and of our commercial and construction loans were variable rate loans  respectively 
the average interest yield on a fully taxable equivalent basis earned on net loans decreased to for the year ended december   from and for years and  respectively 
average net loans were billion in  compared to billion in and billion in also  total interest income and loan yields were impacted by the effect caused by a million increase in nonaccrual loans during  primarily during the fourth quarter of  and a million increase in nonaccrual loans during the amount of interest income we ceased to accrue on nonaccrual loans amounted to million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively  while during the fourth quarter of  it amounted to million  compared to million during the previous quarter 
the amount of interest income we ceased to accrue during the fourth quarter of represented a reduction of approximately basis points in the average interest yield on a fully taxable equivalent basis earned on net loans 
the increase during the fourth quarter of when compared to the previous quarter was directly related to the amount of loans placed in nonaccrual status  which increased from million as of september  to million as of december  total interest expense decreased by to million in  compared to million in  after increasing by from million in the decrease in total interest expense during mainly resulted from the net effect of a decrease in the cost of funds mainly caused by our strategy of calling back our broker callable broker deposits  as explained further below  partially offset by an increase in interest bearing liabilities 
during  the increase in average liabilities were substantially in broker deposits and other borrowings  both of which were higher cost categories resulting in increased interest expense 
the average interest rate on a fully taxable equivalent basis paid for interest bearing liabilities was in  in and in average interest bearing liabilities increased by to billion in  after increasing by to billion in  from billion in during the first quarter of  we called million in broker deposits that paid an average rate of and had a total of  in unamortized commissions that were written off during that quarter 
also  between may and july  we wrote off  in unamortized commissions related to million in broker deposits that paid an average rate of and were called during that period 
we did not call back any broker deposits during the fourth quarter of net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased to for the year ended december   from and for the years ended december  and our net interest spread on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased to in  from in and in the decrease in net interest margin and net interest spread during was mainly caused by decreased yields from interest rate cuts accompanied by a million increase in nonaccrual loans  as previously mentioned  and increased average interest bearing liabilities  which outpaced the reduction in interest rate paid 
during  the decline in the net interest margin and spread was primarily caused by an increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities as a result of the rising short term interest rates and the libor inverted yield curve  which increased at a faster rate than the yield on earning assets  and to the fact that the increase in average deposits was substantially in broker deposits  a higher cost category 
in addition  during  our net interest margin and spread were also affected by decreases in the prime rate  primarily during the fourth quarter of during  our net interest margin and spread were also affected by the write off of  in unamortized placement costs related to the redemption of million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures  as previously mentioned

for  this income source amounted to million  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the increase in service charges and other fees was mainly due to the recording in june of  in income related to the partial redemption of visa  inc shares of stock as part of a series of transactions arising out of the restructuring of visa  inc to become a public company  and also  to a  increase in service charges on deposits accounts  mainly from increases in atm and pos fees from a change in the fee structure during the first quarter of the increase in was mainly due to a  increase in non sufficient fund charges on deposit accounts   in atm merchant fees   in trust fees   in other fees on loan accounts   leasing license commissions  and  in miscellaneous income mainly related to our credit card operations

we anticipate that the overall volume of our noninterest expense will continue to increase as we grow 
however  we remain committed to controlling costs and efficiency and expect to moderate these increases relative to our revenue growth 
salaries and employee benefit expenses increased to million in  from million in this slight increase mainly resulted from the net effect of a  decrease in salary expenses off set by a  decrease in deferred loan origination costs because of a reduction in loan originations during the year

provision for income taxes puerto rico income tax law does not provide for the filing of a consolidated tax return  therefore  the income tax expense reflected in our consolidated income statement is the sum of our income tax expense and the income tax expenses of our individual subsidiaries 
our revenues are generally not subject to us federal income tax 
income tax expense is primarily the sum of two components current tax expense and deferred tax expense benefit 
current tax expense is calculated by applying our current tax rate to taxable income 
the deferred tax expense benefit reflects the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effects  based on current tax law  of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized in our financial statements

during  the increase in the deferred tax benefit was mainly due to an increase in deferred tax assets mainly due to an increase in our provision for loan and lease losses as of december   primarily during the third quarter of in addition  the income tax benefit for the year ended december   included an income tax benefit of  related to tax credits received from puerto rico s treasury department in excess of the amount paid on transactions under the law no 
 as further explained below 
as of december   and  we had net deferred tax assets of million  million and million  respectively 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in making this assessment  management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets  projected future taxable income  our compliance with the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  and tax planning strategies 
based on management projections  we believe it is more likely than not that the benefits of these deductible differences at december  will be realized

our investment policy is reviewed at least annually by our board of directors 
investment balances  including cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  are subject to change over time based on our asset liability funding needs and our interest rate risk management objectives 
our liquidity levels take into consideration anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credits and are maintained at levels management believes are appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting our anticipated funding needs 
our investment portfolio mainly consists of securities classified as available for sale and a portion of securities we intend to hold until maturity  or held to maturity securities 
the carrying values of our available for sale securities are adjusted for unrealized gain or loss as a valuation allowance  and any unrealized gain or loss is reported on an after tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income loss

ii sixteen are private label mortgage backed securities mbs amounting to million that have mixed credit ratings or other special characteristics 
for each one of the mbs  the company reviewed the collateral performance and considered the impact of current economic trends 
these analyses were performed taking into consideration current us market conditions and trends  forward projected cash flows and the present value of the forward projected cash flows 
we determined that  as of december   the estimated present value of all expected cash flows of these investments was at or above their book value

real estate secured loans  the largest component of our loan and lease portfolio  include residential mortgages but is primarily comprised of commercial real estate loans and or commercial lines of credit that are extended to finance the purchase and or improvement of commercial real estate and or businesses thereon or for business working capital purposes 
the properties may be either owner occupied or for investment purposes 
our loan policy adheres to the real estate loan guidelines promulgated by the fdic in the policy provides guidelines including  among other things  review of appraised value  limitation on loan to value ratio  and minimum cash flow requirements to service debt 
on occasions  the bank grants real estate secured loans for which the loan to values exceed 
in some instances  additional forms of collateral or guaranties are obtained 
loans secured by real estate  excluding construction loans  equaled million  million and million as of december   and  respectively

lease financing contracts consist of automobile and equipment leases made to individuals and corporate customers 
our leasing production is concentrated on automobile leasing 
for  approximately of our lease financing contracts originations were for new automobiles  approximately were for used automobiles and the remaining consisted primarily of construction and medical equipment leases 
our portfolio of lease financing contracts decreased to million as of december   from million as of december  and from million as of december  and  respectively 
the decrease in our lease portfolio during and resulted from our decision to strategically pare back our automobile leasing operations upon the continuous economic distress and the deterioration of our lease portfolio during previous fiscal years 
during  the decrease in our leasing portfolio includes the sale of million in march  as previously mentioned 
occasionally  we sell lease financing contracts on a limited recourse basis to other financial institutions and  typically  we retain the right to service the leases we sold

other commercial and industrial loans amounted to million as of december   compared to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
during  the decrease in other commercial and industrial loans was totally offset by an increase in commercial loans secured by real estate  resulting in a net increase of million in total commercial loans 
these were organic changes to the portfolio

construction loans secured by real estate totaled million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
construction loans secured by real estate as a percentage of total loans and leases were  and for those same periods  respectively 
the increase in construction loans secured by real estate during resulted from disbursements on loan commitments we made during or before year  while during  it resulted from of our organic growth 
our construction loan portfolio is mainly comprised of loans for the construction of residential multi family projects that  although private  are moderately priced or of the affordable type supported by government assisted programs  and other loans for land development and the construction of commercial real estate property 
we did not make any new construction loans during year consumer loans have historically represented a small part of our total loan and lease portfolio 
the majority of consumer loans consist of boat loans  personal installment loans  credit cards  and consumer lines of credit 
we make consumer loans only to complement our commercial business  and these loans are not emphasized by our branch managers 
as a result  repayment on this portfolio has generally exceeded or equaled origination  except for  when we acquired consumer loans in connection with our acquisition of banktrust 
consumer loans as a percentage of total loans and leases were  and at the end of  and  respectively

our loan terms vary according to loan type 
commercial term loans generally have maturities of three to five years  while we generally limit commercial loans secured by real estate maturities to five to eight years 
lines of credit  in general  are extended on an annual basis to businesses that need temporary working capital and or import export financing 
leases are offered for terms up to months 
the following table shows our maturity distribution of loans and leases  including loans held for sale of million  as of december   excluding non accrual loans amounting to million as of the same date 
as of december   of our non consumer loan portfolio is comprised of floating rate loans  which are primarily comprised of both commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans

nonperforming loans  leases and assets nonperforming assets consist of loans and leases on nonaccrual status  loans days or more past due and still accruing interest  loans that have been restructured resulting in a reduction or deferral of interest or principal  oreo  and other repossessed assets

more specifically  we attempt to reduce the exposure to risks through reviewing each loan request and renewal individually  utilizing a centralized approval system for all unsecured and secured loans  strictly adhering to written loan policies  and conducting an independent credit review 
in general  we receive and review financial statements of borrowing customers on an ongoing basis during the term of the relationship and respond to any deterioration noted 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become days past due  unless we believe the loan is adequately collateralized and we are in the process of collection 
for loans placed in nonaccrual status  the nonrecognition of interest income on an accrual basis does not constitute forgiveness of the interest  and collection efforts are continuously pursued 
loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status  resulting in an inability to meet the original repayment terms  and when we believe the borrower will eventually overcome financial difficulties and repay the loan in full 
all interest accrued but not collected for loans and leases that are placed on nonaccrual status or charged off is reversed against interest income 
the interest on these loans is accounted for on a cost recovery method  until qualifying for return to accrual status 
nonperforming loans amounted to million as of december   compared to million as of december  and million as of december  the increase in nonperforming loans during was mainly due to the net effect of a million increase in nonaccrual loans and a million decrease in loans days or more past due still accruing interest 
during  the million increase in nonaccrual loans during was mainly due to the combined effect of a million increase in construction loans  million increase in other commercial and industrial loans  and a million increase in commercial loans secured by real estate 
the decrease in loans days or more past due still accruing interest was mainly due to the net effect of a million decrease in construction loans  a million increase in mortgage loans  and a million decrease in commercial loans secured by real estate 
the increase in nonperforming loans during was mainly due to combined effect of a million increase in loans days or more past due still accruing interest and an increase of million nonaccrual loans 
during  the increase in loans days or more past due still accruing interest was mainly due to the combined effect of a million increase in loans secured by real estate  a  increase in other commercial and industrial loans  a  increase in lease financing contracts  and a  increase in overdraft 
the million increase in nonaccrual loans during was mainly due to the net effect of a million increase in loans secured by real estate  a million increase related to one construction business relationship  which was partially secured by real estate and also had other corporate guaranties  a  decrease in lease financing contracts  and a  decrease in marine loans 
we believe all loans and leases  with which we have serious doubts as to collectibility  are classified within the category of nonperforming loans and leases and are appropriately reserved 
repossessed assets remained at million as of december  and  compared to million as of december  changes in repossessed assets were mainly attributable to the combined effect of i an increase of  in other real estate owned oreo during resulting from the net effect of the sale of properties and the foreclosure of properties  including the sale of land lots in the amount of million  which had been repossessed from a commercial customer during the fourth quarter of  and a million increase in oreo during resulting from the net effect of the sale of properties and the foreclosure of properties

the decrease in repossessed vehicles during and was mainly attributable to our strategy of being more aggressive in the sale of repossessed vehicles 
as previously mentioned  this strategy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of repossessed vehicles in inventory 
as of december   our oreo consisted of properties with an aggregate value of million  compared to properties with an aggregate value of million as of december   and properties with an aggregate value of million as of december  allowance for loan and lease losses we have established an allowance for loan and lease losses to provide for loans and leases in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  monthly assessments of probable estimated losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  as discussed below  and specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio segments 
when analyzing the adequacy of our allowance  our portfolio is segmented into major loan categories 
although the evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance focuses on loans and leases and pools of similar loans and leases  no part of our allowance is segregated for  or allocated to  any particular asset or group of assets 
our allowance is available to absorb all credit losses inherent in our portfolio 
each component would normally have similar characteristics  such as classification  type of loan or lease  industry or collateral 
as needed  we separately analyze the following components of our portfolio and provide for them in our allowance credit quality  sufficiency of credit and collateral documentation  proper lien perfection  appropriate approval by the loan officer and the loan committees  adherence to any loan agreement covenants  and compliance with internal policies  procedures  laws and regulations 
for the general portion of our allowance  we follow a consistent procedural discipline and account for loan and lease loss contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the general portion of our allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to all categories of unimpaired loans and leases outstanding in our portfolio 
we use historic loss rates determined over a period of to years  which  at least on an annual basis  are adjusted to reflect any current conditions that are expected to result in loss recognition 
the resulting loss factors are then multiplied against the current period s balance of unimpaired loans outstanding to derive an estimated loss 
rates for each pool are based on those factors management believes are applicable to that pool 
when applied to a pool of loans or leases  the adjusted historical loss rate is a measure of the total inherent losses in the portfolio that would have been estimated if each individual loan or lease had been reviewed 
in addition  another component is used in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance 
this additional component serves as a management tool to measure the probable effect that current internal and external environmental factors could have on the historical loss factors currently in use 
factors that we consider include  but are not limited to levels of  and trends in  delinquencies and nonaccruals  levels of  and trends in  charge offs  and recoveries  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards  and other changes in lending policies  procedures and practices  changes in the experience  ability and depth of our lending management and relevant staff  national and local economic business trends and conditions 
banking industry conditions  and effect of changes in concentrations of credit that might affect loss experience across one or more components of the portfolio 
on a quarterly basis  a risk percentage is assigned to each environmental factor based on our judgment of the risks over each loan category 
the result of our assumptions is then applied to the current period s balance of unimpaired loans outstanding to derive the probable effect these current internal and external environmental factors could have over the general portion of our allowance 
the net allowance resulting from this procedure is included as an additional component in the evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance 
in addition to our general portfolio allowance  specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a credit that management believes indicate a high probability that a loss have been incurred 
this amount is determined following a consistent procedural discipline in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
for impaired commercial and construction business relationships with aggregate balances exceeding  we measure the impairment following the guidance of sfas no 
to mitigate any difference between estimates and actual results relative to the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses  our loan review department is specifically charged with reviewing monthly delinquency reports to determine if additional allowances are necessary 
delinquency reports and analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses are also provided to senior management and the board of directors on a monthly basis 
the loan review department evaluates significant changes in delinquency with regard to a particular loan portfolio to determine the potential for continuing trends  and loss projections are estimated and adjustments are made to the historical loss factor applied to that portfolio in connection with the calculation of loss allowances  as necessary 
portfolio performance is also monitored through the monthly calculation of the percentage of non performing loans to the total portfolio outstanding 
a significant change in this percentage may trigger a review of the portfolio and eventually lead to additional allowances 
we also track the ratio of net charge offs to total portfolio outstanding  among other ratios 
consumer loans  leases and residential mortgages with a loan to value over that are more than days delinquent are subject to an additional allowance 
commercial and construction loans that reach days of delinquency  or earlier if deemed appropriate by management  are subject to review by the loan review department including  but not limited to  a review of financial statements  repayment ability and collateral held 
in connection with this review  the loan review department will determine what economic factors may have led to the change in the client s ability to service the obligation  and this in turn may result in an additional review of a particular sector of the economy 
although our management believes that the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans and leases that may become uncollectible  there can be no assurance that our allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual loan and lease losses in the future 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses 
such agencies may require us to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
the table below summarizes  for the periods indicated  loan and lease balances at the end of each period  the daily average balances during the period  changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses arising from loans and leases charged off  recoveries on loans and leases previously charged off  and additions to the allowance  and certain ratios related to the allowance for loan and lease losses year ended december  dollars in thousands average total loans and leases outstanding during period total loans and leases outstanding at end of period allowance for loan and lease losses allowance at beginning of period charge offs real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer leases other loans total charge offs recoveries real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer leases other loans total recoveries net loan and lease charge offs provision for loan and lease losses allowance of acquired bank banktrust allowance at end of period ratios net loan and lease charge offs to average total loans allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans at end of period net loan and lease charge offs to allowance for loan losses at end of period net loan and lease charge offs to provision for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses increased by  or million  to million as of december   after increasing by  or million  to million as of december   from million in the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases increased to at the end of year  from in and in we consider that the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in the portfolio 
the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses during was primarily related to our commercial and construction loan portfolios  which reported further deterioration due to current economic conditions resulting in higher credit losses and increased specific allowances on impaired loans  as previously mentioned 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is affected by net charge offs  loan portfolio balance  and also by the provision for loan and lease losses for each related period  which  during and  was certainly impacted by the overall economic conditions 
during  the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was mainly caused by three business relationships  which became impaired during the third quarter of and required a specific allowance of million  as previously mentioned 
as of december   and  impaired loans amounted to million  million and million  respectively  with related specific allowances amounting to million  million and million for those same periods 
net charge offs were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
on a quarterly basis  we have the practice of effecting partial charge offs on all lease finance contracts that are over days past due 
this is done based on our historical lease loss experience during the previous calendar year 
for each of the years ended december   and  we used a historical loss ratio in lease finance contracts of approximately  and  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  approximately million  million and million was charged off for this purpose  respectively 
also  except for leases in a payment plan  bankruptcy or other legal proceedings  we have the practice of charging off most of our lease finance contracts that are over days past due at the end of each quarter 
for the years ended december   and  approximately   and  was charged off for this purpose  respectively 
we monitor the ratio of net charge offs on the leasing business to the average balance of our leasing portfolio 
the net charge off ratio on the leasing business was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in the net charge off ratio on the leases business during and was mainly due to a decrease in our lease portfolio 
the amount of net charge offs in our leasing portfolio remained at million between the years ended december  and our lease portfolio decreased to million as of december   from million as of december   and from million at the end of year we continue closely monitoring the lease portfolio and have tightened underwriting standards in an attempt to reduce possible future losses 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans was  and for the years  and  respectively 
net charge offs as a percentage of provision for loan and lease losses was as of december   compared to as of december  and in the change in these ratios during was impacted by the increased net charge offs in our commercial loan portfolio  increased nonperforming loans  delinquencies  and adverse classifications in our commercial and construction loans portfolios  mainly driven by the overall condition of the economy  as previously mentioned 
net charge offs as a percentage of our year end portfolio balance  or net loss experience  has averaged for our commercial loan portfolio over the past three years 
for our commercial loan portfolio  we maintain an allowance equal to of its outstanding balance 
our consumer loan portfolio  excluding boat financing  has averaged a net loss experience over the past three years 
for our consumer loan portfolio  excluding boat financing  we maintain an allowance equal to of its outstanding balance

the increase in nonearning assets during was mainly related to the construction of the aguadilla branch  which we completed in february during  the increase in nonearning assets was primarily attributable to the purchase of land and an office building to serve as our new headquarters

there is fierce competition for core deposits on the island 
as a result  replacing called back broker deposits was an attractive funding strategy  lowering funding costs when compared to the unusually higher rates offered locally for time deposits 
as previously mentioned  during  we replaced callable broker deposits in an attempt to control increases in our funding cost  as follows million during the first quarter of that paid an average rate of  and million between may and july that paid an average rate of 
we did not call back any broker deposits during the fourth quarter of because broker deposits are generally more volatile and interest rate sensitive than other sources of funds  management closely monitors growth in this category 
as previously mentioned  we heavily rely on broker deposits as a short term funding source to meet its liquidity needs 
broker deposits  when compared to retail deposits attracted through a branch network  are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates and volatility in the capital markets and could reduce our net interest spread and net interest margin 
in addition  broker deposit funding sources may be more sensitive to significant changes in our financial condition 
the ability to continue to acquire broker deposits is subject to our ability to price these deposits at competitive levels  which may substantially increase the funding costs  and the confidence of the market 
in addition  if our capital ratios fall below the levels necessary to be considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we could be restricted in using broker deposits as a short term funding source unless we obtain a waiver from the federal deposit insurance corporation 
restrictions on our ability to participate in this market could place limitations on our growth strategy or could result in our participation in other more expensive funding sources 
in case of restrictions  our expansion strategies would have to be reviewed to reflect the possible limitation to funding sources and changes in cost structures 
this could materially impact our liquidity position 
as of december   we and eurobank both qualified as well capitalized institutions under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
the following table sets forth the amount and maturities of the time deposits in denominations of  or more and broker deposits  regardless the denomination  as of the dates indicated  excluding individual retirement accounts as of december  in thousands three months or less over three months through six months over six months through months over months total section of the federal deposit insurance act fdia limits the use of brokered deposits by institutions that are less than well capitalized and allows the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to place restrictions on interest rates that institutions may pay 
on february   the fdic released a proposed rule to implement new interest rate restrictions on institutions that are not well capitalized 
the proposed rule would limit the interest rate paid by such institutions to basis points above a national rate  as derived from the interest rate average of all institutions 
if an institution could provide evidence that its local rate is higher  it would be permitted to offer the higher local rate plus basis points 
although we continue to be well capitalized  these restrictions  if they become applicable  could materially impact our ability to generate sufficient deposits to maintain an adequate liquidity position 
other sources of funds the strong competition for core deposits on the island made other short term borrowings an attractive funding alternative 
during  the average interest rate on a fully taxable equivalent basis we paid for other borrowings decreased to  from and for the year and  respectively 
average other borrowings increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the year and  respectively

if the market data is obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity  the market data is considered an observable input and related assets or liabilities will be classified within levels and of the hierarchy 
when the reporting entity s own assumptions are used as market participant assumptions  the market data is considered an unobservable input and related assets or liabilities are classified within level of the hierarchy 
a brief description of possible inputs under each level of the hierarchy is further discussed below 
level level inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities we have the ability to access 
level level inputs are those other than unadjusted quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
these inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  other than unadjusted quoted prices  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
where the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels  the level within which the entire fair value measurement falls will be based on the lowest most significant level used to determine the fair value measurement in its entirety 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability being valued 
the fair value of financial assets requiring to be presented at their fair market value is measured on a recurring basis 
the fair value of non financial assets or financial assets requiring to be presented at the lower of cost or fair market value is measured on a non recurring basis 
as of december   we had million and  in assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis  respectively  of which million in assets and all liabilities were classified within level of the hierarchy 
remaining assets measured on a recurring basis were classified within level of the hierarchy 
as of the same date  we had million in assets measured on a non recurring basis  of which million and million were level and level assets  respectively 
the unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value of level assets were not considered material 
assets measured on a recurring basis as of december  included million in securities available for sale 
on a monthly basis  we obtained quoted prices from two nationally recognized brokers the nrb to determine the fair value of securities available for sale 
every month  we compare the valuation received from one nrb to valuation received from the other nrb  and consistently evaluate any difference in market price equal or greater than 
for mortgage backed securities mbs  the specific characteristics of the different tranches on a mbs are very important in the expected performance of the security and its fair value level inputs 
as of december   we owned a preferred security that was issued under the rule a under the securities act of the quarterly dividends of this security are current but the security does not have an active secondary market 
on a quarterly basis  we review the financial results of the company to estimate if the issuer has the capacity to pay its obligations at maturity level inputs 
significant inputs considered to determine the fair value of securities available for sale include the market yield curve  credit rating of issuer and collateral 
a change in the slope or an increase in the market yield curve  or deterioration of the issuer s credit rating or collateral  can significantly reduce the fair market value of securities available for sale 
also  a change in the slope or a decrease in the market yield curve  or an upgrade of the issuer s credit rating or collateral  can significantly increase the fair market value of securities available for sale 
changes in the fair market value of securities available for sale are reported as part of total stockholders equity in other comprehensive income 
a decrease in the fair market value of securities available for sale can reduce our liquidity levels adversely impacting our borrowing capacity and reducing our total capital 
on the contrary  an increase in the fair market value of securities available for sale can augment our liquidity levels positively impacting our borrowing capacity and increasing our total capital 
for more information on the fair value of assets and liabilities please refer to note fair value to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
capital resources and capital adequacy requirements we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that rely on quantitative measures of our assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
we monitor compliance with bank regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on the risk based capital guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
generally  tier capital includes common stockholders equity  the proceeds from our series a preferred stock and the proceeds from our junior subordinated debentures subject to certain limitations  less goodwill and disallowed deferred tax assets 
total capital represents tier plus the allowance for loan and lease losses subject to certain limits 
as of december   and  total stockholders equity was million  million and million  respectively 
besides losses and earnings from operations  stock options exercised  and stock repurchases  our stockholders equity was also impacted by an accumulated other comprehensive loss of million as of december   an accumulated other comprehensive gain of million as of december   and an accumulated other comprehensive loss of million for the year ended december  also  during  the company s stockholders equity was also affected by the cumulative effect of a  adjustment on the initial adoption of staff accounting bulletin no

in addition  the following items also impacted our stockholders equity during  a total of  stock options were exercised for the aggregate price of million  as follows  on january  at an aggregate exercise price of  and  in march at an aggregate exercise price of million 
the repurchase of unvested restricted shares from former employees during the third quarter of  for a total of  these restricted shares were originally granted in april during  a total of  stock options were exercised for the aggregate exercise price of million  as follows  on february  at an aggregate exercise price of million  and  stock options on july  at an aggregate exercise price of between the second and third quarter of  we repurchased  shares for million in connection with a stock repurchase program approved by the board of directors in may  which was completed in september in an effort to improve our net interest margin  on december   we redeemed million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures bearing an interest rate of at the time of redemption  upon which eurobank statutory trust i  one of our non banking subsidiaries  redeemed million in trust preferred securities 
up to december   we included these trust preferred securities as part of our tier capital 
we believe that remaining supplemental capital raised in connection with the issuance of trust preferred securities from eurobank statutory trust ii will allow us to maintain our status as a well capitalized institution and to sustain our loan growth

during  a total of  options were exercised for the aggregate exercise price of  as follows  options on september  at an aggregate exercise price of   options on june  at an aggregate exercise price of  and  options on february  at an aggregate exercise price of  during  we repurchased  shares for million upon a stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors in october  which expired in october we are not aware of any material trends that could materially affect our capital resources other than those described in the section entitled risk factors  in this annual report on form k 
as of december   we and eurobank both qualified as well capitalized institutions under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
however  if our capital ratios fall below the levels necessary to be considered well capitalized under current regulatory guidelines  we could be restricted in using broker deposits as a short term funding source 
the following table presents the regulatory standards for well capitalized institutions  compared to our capital ratios for eurobank as of the dates specified actual for minimum capital adequacy purposes to be well capitalized under prompt corrective action provision amount is ratio is amount must be ratio must be amount must be ratio must be dollars in thousands as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets eurobancshares  inc n a eurobank tier capital to risk weighted assets eurobancshares  inc n a eurobank leverage to average assets eurobancshares  inc n a eurobank as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets eurobancshares  inc n a eurobank tier capital to risk weighted assets eurobancshares  inc n a eurobank leverage to average assets eurobancshares  inc n a eurobank as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets eurobancshares  inc n a eurobank tier capital to risk weighted assets eurobancshares  inc n a eurobank leverage to average assets eurobancshares  inc n a eurobank liquidity management maintenance of adequate core liquidity requires that sufficient resources be available at all times to meet our cash flow requirements 
liquidity in a banking institution is required primarily to provide for deposit withdrawals and the credit needs of customers and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise 
liquidity management involves our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without incurring significant loss  and to raise cash or maintain funds without incurring excessive additional cost 
for this purpose  the bank chose to maintain a minimum target liquidity referred as core basis surplus and defined as the portion of the bank s funds maintained in short term investments and other marketable assets  less the liabilities portions secured by any of these assets to cover a portion of time deposits maturing in days and a portion of the non maturity deposits  expressed as a percentage of total assets 
this core basis surplus number generally should be positive  but it may vary as our asset and liability committee decides to maintain relatively large or small liquidity coverage  depending on its estimates of the general business climate  its expectations regarding the future course of interest rates in the near term  and the bank s current financial position 
two additional factors that will impact the magnitude of the core basic surplus target are the available borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank fhlb  as represented by qualifying loans on the balance sheet  and unused brokered time deposits capacity relative to the bank s related policy limit on acceptable levels of these deposits 
for this reason  current fhlb advances and broker time deposits availability are part of the bank s liquidity presentation 
our liquid assets at december   and totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our core basis surplus liquidity level was  and as of the same periods  respectively 
the million increase in our core basic surplus liquidity level during was mainly attributable to the net effect of a million increase in short term investments  the net growth of million in our investment portfolio by using portfolio repayments in addition to funding with broker deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  which increased by million 
as of december   the decrease in our core basic surplus liquidity level was mainly attributable to the reduction in interest bearing deposits and short term investments previously mentioned  and that the growth in the investment portfolio was funded mostly with repurchase agreements and other collateralized borrowings reducing the portion of unpledged securities to total assets when compared to december  as mentioned above  in addition to the normal influx of liquidity from core deposit growth  together with repayments and maturities of loans and investments  we utilize fhlb advances and broker and out of market certificates of deposit to meet our liquidity needs 
other funding alternatives are borrowing lines with brokers and the federal reserve bank of new york  and an unsecured line of credit with a correspondent bank 
in october  the fdic implemented its new temporary liquidity guarantee program to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks  thrifts  and certain holding companies  and by providing full coverage of non interest bearing deposit transaction accounts  regardless of dollar amount 
under the current rules  certain newly issued senior unsecured debt issued on or before june   would be fully protected in the event the issuing institution subsequently fails  or its holding company files for bankruptcy 
the guarantee is limited to of senior unsecured debt as of september  that is scheduled to mature before june  this includes promissory notes  commercial paper  inter bank funding  and any unsecured portion of secured debt 
coverage would be limited to june   even if the maturity exceeds that date 
participants will have the option to issue non guaranteed senior unsecured debt for a non refundable fee of basis points  provided that the debt has a term greater than three years 
participants will be charged a basis point fee to protect their new debt issues amounts paid as a non refundable fee will be applied to offset this basis point fee until the non refundable fee is exhausted 
institutions are automatically enrolled in this program unless they choose to opt out 
although the company did not have any senior unsecured borrowings outstanding as of september   the company did not opt out of this program  which could provide coverage for future senior unsecured debt 
advances from the fhlb are typically secured by qualified residential and commercial mortgage loans  and investment securities 
advances are made pursuant to several different programs 
each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
depending on the program  limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution s net worth or on the fhlb s assessment of the institution s creditworthiness 
as of december   we had fhlb borrowing capacity of million  including fhlb advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
also  as of the same date  we had million in pre approved repurchase agreements with major brokers and banks  subject to acceptable unpledged marketable securities  which amounted million as of december  in addition  eurobank is able to borrow up to million from the federal reserve bank using securities currently pledged as collateral 
eurobank also maintains a pre approved overnight borrowing line with a correspondent bank  which provided additional short term borrowing capacity of million as of december  our ability to meet our current obligations is dependent on our various sources of liquidity 
as of december   we had  on a stand alone basis  million of liquid assets available to meet our current obligations which consist primarily of interest payments on junior subordinated debentures and outstanding preferred stock 
in the event that we become less than well capitalized for regulatory capital purposes  we would become subject to certain interest rate restrictions that we are permitted to pay on various deposit sources and eurobank may become prohibited from paying dividends to us 
these restrictions could impact our ability to meet our current obligations and may require that we elect to defer quarterly interest payments on our outstanding junior subordinated debentures in order to preserve our liquidity and capital positions 
as previously mentioned  we heavily rely on broker deposits as a short term funding source to meet its liquidity needs 
broker deposits  when compared to retail deposits attracted through a branch network  are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates and volatility in the capital markets  which may force us to pay above market interest rates to retain these deposits  reducing our net interest spread and net interest margin 
in addition  broker deposit funding sources may be more sensitive to significant changes in our financial condition 
the ability to continue to acquire broker deposits is subject to our ability to price these deposits at competitive levels  which may substantially increase the funding costs  and the confidence of the market 
in addition  if our capital ratios fall below the levels necessary to be considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we could be restricted in using broker deposits as a short term funding source unless we obtain a waiver from the federal deposit insurance corporation 
restrictions on our ability to participate in this market could place limitations on our growth strategy or could result in our participation in other more expensive funding sources 
in case of restrictions  our expansion strategies would have to be reviewed to reflect the possible limitation to funding sources and changes in cost structures 
as indicated above  our liquidity sources are comprised primarily of secured funding outlets  such as the fhlb and federal reserve bank  and deposits originated through eurobank s branch network and from broker deposits 
there can be no assurance that actions by the fhlb or frb would not reduce eurobank s borrowing capacity or that we would be able to continue to replace deposits at competitive rates 
as previously mentioned  if our capital ratio falls below well capitalized  we would need regulatory consent before accepting brokered deposits 
over the next months  approximately million of broker deposits will mature 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to replace these broker deposits with deposits at competitive rates 
such events could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
however  if we are unable to replace these maturing deposits with new deposits  we believe that we have adequate liquidity resources to fund this need with our secured funding outlets with the fhlb and frb 
our minimum target core basis surplus liquidity ratio established in our asset liability management policy is of total assets 
as of december   our core basic surplus liquidity ratio was  well above the established minimum target 
our liquidity demands are not seasonal and all trends have been stable over the last three years 
we are not aware of any trends or demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to materially impair our liquidity 
generally  financial institutions determine their target liquidity ratios internally  based on the composition of their liquidity assets and their ability to participate in different funding markets that can provide the required liquidity 
in addition  the local market has unique characteristics  which make it very difficult to compare our liquidity needs and sources to the liquidity needs and sources of our peers in the rest of the nation 
after careful analysis of the diversity of liquidity sources available to us  we have determined that our target liquidity ratio is adequate 
our net cash inflows from operating activities for were million  compared to cash inflows of million and million from operating activities for the year and  respectively 
during  the net operating cash inflows resulted primarily from the net effect of i proceeds from sale of loans held for sale  ii a decrease in accrued interest receivable  iii a decrease in accrued interest payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  and iv a net decrease in other assets

impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessary move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services since such prices are affected by inflation 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of our business activities 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on our net interest income or the market value of our financial instruments 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset and liability management process  which is governed by policies established by eurobank s board of directors and carried out by eurobank s asset liability management committee 
the asset liability management committee s objectives are to manage our exposure to interest rate risk over both the one year planning cycle and the longer term strategic horizon and  at the same time  to provide a stable and steadily increasing flow of net interest income 
interest rate risk management activities include establishing guidelines for tenor and repricing characteristics of new business flow  the maturity ladder of wholesale funding  investment security purchase and sale strategies and mortgage loan sales  as well as derivative financial instruments 
eurobank may enter into interest rate swap agreements  in which it exchanges the periodic payments  based on a notional amount and agreed upon fixed and variable interest rates 
also  eurobank may use contracts to transform the interest rate characteristics of specifically identified assets or liabilities to which the contract is tied 
at december   the bank had interest rate swap agreements which converted million of fixed rate time deposits to variable rate time deposits maturing in with semi annual call options which match call options on the swaps 
this swap was terminated on january  upon the cancellation of the related certificate of deposit 
in addition  as of december   eurobank had  related to an option and equity based return derivative  which was purchased in january to fix the interest rate expense on a million certificate of deposit 
for more detail on derivative financial instruments please refer to note derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
our primary measurement of interest rate risk is earnings at risk  which is determined through computerized simulation modeling 
the primary simulation model assumes a static balance sheet  using the balances  rates  maturities and repricing characteristics of all of the bank s existing assets and liabilities  including off balance sheet financial instruments 
net interest income is computed by the model assuming market rates remaining unchanged and compares those results to other interest rate scenarios with changes in the magnitude  timing and relationship between various interest rates 
at december   we modeled rising ramp and declining interest rate simulations in basis point increments over two years 
the impact of embedded options in such products as callable and mortgage backed securities  real estate mortgage loans and callable borrowings were considered 
changes in net interest income in the rising and declining rate scenarios are then measured against the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario 
the asset liability management committee utilizes the results of the model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes and to understand the level of risk volatility given a range of reasonable and plausible interest rate scenarios 
in this context  the core interest rate risk analysis examines the balance sheet under rates up down scenarios that are neither too modest nor too extreme 
all rate changes are ramped over a month horizon based upon a parallel yield curve shift and maintained at those levels over the remainder of the simulation horizon 
using this approach  we are able to obtain results that illustrate the effect that both a gradual change of rates year and a rate shock year and beyond has on margin expectations 
in the december  simulation  our model indicated no material exposure in the level of net interest income to gradual rising rates ramped for the first month period  and no exposure in the level of net interest income to a rate shock of rising rates for the second month period 
this is caused by the effect of the volume of our commercial and industrial loans variable rate portfolio and the maturity distribution of the repurchase agreements and broker deposits  our primary funding source  from days to approximately years 
the hypothetical rate scenarios consider a change of and basis points during two years 
the decreasing rate scenarios have a floor of basis points because  with current interest yield curve  an additional basis points reduction in rates would imply a negative or zero percent yield in us treasury bills 
at december   the net interest income at risk for year one in the basis point falling rate scenario was calculated at  or lower than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario 
the net interest income at risk for year two in the basis point falling rate scenario was calculated at million  or higher than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario 
at december   the net interest income at risk for year one in the basis point rising rate scenario was calculated to be million  or higher than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario  and million  or higher than the net interest income in the rate unchanged scenario at the december  simulation with a basis point increase 
the net interest income at risk for year two in the basis point rising rate scenario was calculated at million  or higher than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario  and million  or higher than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario at the december  simulation with a basis point increase 
during the first year  these exposures are well within our policy guidelines of and for and basis points changes in rate scenarios  respectively 
exposures during the second year are above the policy guidelines  but the estimated net interest income for the three different scenarios are positive and higher than indicated guidelines 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan and security prepayments  deposit run offs and pricing and reinvestment strategies and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we may take in response to changes in interest rates 
we cannot assure you that our actual net interest income would increase or decrease by the amounts computed by the simulations 
the following table indicates the estimated impact on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios as of december  change in future net interest income gradual raising rate scenario year at december  change in interest rates dollar change percentage change dollars in thousands basis points over year basis points over year basis points over year basis points over year n a n a change in future net interest income rate shock scenario year at december  change in interest rates dollar change percentage change dollars in thousands basis points over year basis points over year basis points over year basis points over year n a n a we also monitor core funding utilization in each interest rate scenario as well as market value of equity 
these measures are used to evaluate long term interest rate risk beyond the two year planning horizon 
aggregate contractual obligations the following table represents our on and off balance sheet aggregate contractual obligations  other than deposit liabilities  to make future payments to third parties as of the date specified as of december  one year or less over one year to three years over three years to five years over five years in thousands fhlb advances notes payable to statutory trusts operating leases total off balance sheet arrangements during the ordinary course of business  we provide various forms of credit lines to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these commitments  which have a term of less than one year  represent a credit risk and are not represented in any form on our balance sheets 
as of december   and  we had commitments to extend credit of million  million and  respectively 
these commitments included standby letters of credit of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively  and commercial letters of credit of  million and  for those same periods  respectively 
the effect on our revenues  expenses  cash flows and liquidity of the unused portions of these commitments cannot reasonably be predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used

recent developments on october   the united states congress passed the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa  which provides the u 
s 
secretary of the treasury with broad authority to implement certain actions to help restore stability and liquidity to us markets 
one of the provisions resulting from the act is the treasury capital purchase program the cpp  which provides direct equity investment of perpetual preferred stock by the treasury in qualified financial institutions 
the cpp is voluntary and requires an institution to comply with a number of restrictions and provisions  including limits on executive compensation  stock redemptions and declaration of dividends 
in addition  eesa temporarily raises the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage from  to  per depositor 
the temporary increase in deposit insurance coverage became effective on october  the legislation provides that the basic deposit insurance limit will return to  on december  on october   the fdic announced the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp  which will guarantee certain newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by participating institutions on or after october   and before june  also  the fdic will provide full fdic deposit insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts held at participating fdic insured institutions
