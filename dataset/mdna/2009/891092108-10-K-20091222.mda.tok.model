item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis md a provides material historical and prospective disclosures intended to enable investors and other readers to assess our financial condition and results of operations 
statements that are not historical are forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed in part i  item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we design  manufacture  and market professional turf maintenance equipment and services  turf and agricultural micro irrigation systems  landscaping equipment  and residential yard and snow removal products worldwide 
we sell our products through a network of distributors  dealers  hardware retailers  home centers  mass retailers  and over the internet 
our businesses are organized into three reportable business segments professional  residential  and distribution 
our distribution segment  which consists of our company owned domestic distributorships  has been combined with our corporate activities and financing functions that is shown as other 
our emphasis is to provide innovative  well built  and dependable products supported by an extensive service network 
a significant portion of our revenues has historically been  and we expect it to continue to be  attributable to new and enhanced products 
external factors impacting our business fiscal was a year marked by many significant challenges 
we entered fiscal expecting that a difficult sales environment would negatively pressure our results  but the adverse effects of the worldwide recessionary economic conditions  weakness in the housing and commercial construction markets  tight credit markets  and rising unemployment experienced in fiscal were even greater than anticipated 
the economic strain on consumers and businesses intensified during the first half of fiscal as unemployment swelled  resulting in a further decline in consumer confidence and spending 
like many companies  our sales were negatively impacted by the deferral of large capital equipment purchases  particularly in the golf market  as well as the delay or cancellation of new construction and large renovation projects 
this resulted in contracted markets with increased competitive pressure 
the golf market was further impacted as course revenues and memberships declined  even though actual rounds played were essentially flat year over year 
the challenges faced by our professional segment were compounded by the unprecedented levels of instability in the financial markets that resulted from the global credit crisis  which led to difficulties for our customers to access credit 
during fiscal  we also experienced significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that negatively impacted our net sales by approximately million in fiscal given the uncertainty in the economic environment  we remained focused on growing market share  controlling expenses  and effectively managing our assets 
growing market share one of our priorities for fiscal was to drive market share gains 
this was evidenced by our expanded product offering  commitment to innovation  and ability to capitalize on the evolving competitive landscape 
while our markets contracted in fiscal  information obtained from reputable third party sources  combined with our internal market assessment  leads us to believe that we increased our overall market share in key product categories 
for example  we increased our market share for toro and lawn boy walk power mowers as a result of additional product placement at a key retailer for a new and broader line of walk power mowers 
our riding products also gained market share  in part from our new platform of toro titan zero turning mowers that were well received by customers 
in the landscape contractor market  we entered a new product category with the introduction of our toro grandstand premium stand on mower 
we also realized market share growth with the introduction of our next generation toro and exmark zero turn radius riding mowers that feature more efficient designs with fewer parts 
our investment in the water management business also continued with our new line of precision series spray nozzles  featuring our patented h o chip technology that reduces runoff and water use  our new line of aqua traxx pbx premium drip tape that gained ground as agricultural growers focus on conserving water  and the turf guard wireless soil sensor that more accurately manages turf health and water usage 
customer reception was strong for our new groundsmaster products and workman utility vehicles 
in addition  through focused marketing efforts and building solid relationships with customers around the world who value our brands and service  we captured market share in the sports fields and grounds and golf course markets 
we believe that our commitment to product innovation and strong customer relationships  even during these turbulent times  positioned us well for future growth as our markets recover 
controlling expenses during fiscal  we also focused on reducing expenses 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expense was down million  or percent  for fiscal compared to fiscal as our employees responded well to our call to restrain spending and implement tighter cost controls 
in fiscal  we reduced our worldwide salaried and office workforce by approximately employees through workforce reduction programs and attrition  suspended regularly scheduled salary increases  reduced officers salaries  changed our vacation policy and related accrual  and implemented four furlough days 
we also reviewed our manufacturing and warehouse operations  resulting in efforts to close and consolidate facilities into other locations 
we believe these actions should provide a leaner  more efficient manufacturing and logistics model going forward 
at the same time  we remained focused on innovation as a means of providing increased value to our customers 
asset management in our quest to become an integrated lean enterprise  we placed continued emphasis on asset management during fiscal this is a continuous endeavor that we believe is fundamentally changing the way we do business 
our long term asset management goal is to reduce average net working capital as a percent of net sales below percent  or in the teens 
we define net working capital as accounts receivable plus inventory less trade payables 
in fiscal and  our average net working capital as a percentage of net sales was percent and percent  respectively 
in fiscal  we announced the formation of red iron acceptance  llc red iron  a joint venture between toro and tcf inventory finance  inc tcfif 
the purposes of establishing this joint venture are to provide inventory financing  including floor plan and open account receivable financing  of our products to distributors and dealers in the us and to select distributors of our products in canada  as well as to free up our working capital for strategic purposes 
red iron began financing floor plan receivables in the fourth quarter of fiscal red iron also began financing open account receivables  as well as floor plan receivables previously financed by a third party financing company  during our first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we reduced inventory levels in our plants and warehouses  and our distribution channels also reduced their inventory levels 
throughout the supply chain  we expect to continue to reduce our costs as more of our products use common components and we negotiate more favorable supplier agreements 
in fiscal  we continued to roll out a pull based production system that we plan to implement companywide over time 
the pull model is based on retail sales that trigger replenishment cycles throughout the supply chain 
as manufacturing becomes better synchronized with customer demand  we expect inventory reductions at our facilities 
we expect that our continued focus on asset management will improve customer satisfaction by delivering the right products to the right customer at just the right time to meet demand 
summary of fiscal results fiscal was a difficult year with significant decreases in net sales and net earnings compared to fiscal our fiscal results included the following items of significance net sales for fiscal decreased by percent to  million compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to decreased demand largely resulting from the global recessionary economic conditions that adversely impacted both domestic and international sales 
consequently  we did not achieve our revenue growth growlean initiative goal to grow net sales at an average rate of percent or more over a three year period  as our average annual net sales declined percent over the three year period ended october  international net sales for fiscal were down million  or nearly percent  compared to fiscal  also due to decreased demand largely as a result of recessionary conditions around the world that adversely impacted our key international markets 
approximately million of this net sales decline was the result of the strengthening of the us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact business 
international net sales comprised percent of our total consolidated net sales in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal fiscal net earnings decreased percent to million compared to fiscal  and diluted net earnings per share declined percent to compared to fiscal our after tax return on sales for fiscal was percent compared to percent in fiscal we did not achieve our growlean profitability goal of attaining a consistent after tax return on sales of percent or more over a three year period  as our average after tax return on sales for the three year period ended october  was percent 
professional segment net sales  which represented over percent of our total consolidated net sales in fiscal  were significantly down by percent in fiscal compared to fiscal due to decreased demand resulting largely as a consequence of the global recessionary conditions  despite positive customer response to new products we introduced 
our residential segment net sales were down slightly by percent in fiscal compared to fiscal this decline was primarily attributable to lower demand for riding products as a result of the poor economic conditions  despite customer acceptance for a new line of zero turning riding mowers  and a decrease in electric blower product sales 
sales of snow thrower products were also down due to the timing of the introduction for a new redesigned offering of snow thrower products that shipped to customers in the first quarter of fiscal somewhat offsetting this net sales decline was increased shipments of walk power mowers due to additional product placement at a key retailer and a new and broader line of walk power mowers 
gross margin was percent in fiscal  down from percent in fiscal as we experienced decreased demand for our products in fiscal as a result of the recessionary economic conditions  we cut production to align it with the decline in sales volumes and to reduce inventory levels 
this lower plant utilization resulted in higher manufacturing costs that negatively impacted our gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  our gross margin for fiscal was hampered by a decrease in sales of our higher margin products and a stronger us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact business 
while we have been reducing our expenses during this difficult time  the decline in net sales was greater than the rate we were able to reduce sg a costs 
although sg a expense was down percent in fiscal compared to fiscal  sg a expense as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was percent compared to percent in fiscal during our fourth fiscal quarter  we formed red iron  a joint venture with tcfif 
the purposes of establishing red iron are to provide inventory financing for our distributors and dealers in the us and canada  as well as free up working capital as part of our asset management initiative 
in fiscal  we sold million of floor plan receivables to red iron 
despite the difficult economic conditions we faced in fiscal  we improved our asset management with a percent decline in our inventory to million as of the end of fiscal our domestic field inventory levels were also down as of the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal due in part to our continued focus to improve field inventory management 
we continued to generate strong cash flows from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of percent  due mainly to the sale of our floor plan receivables to red iron 
we declared a cash dividend of per share each quarter in fiscal we continued with our stock repurchase program in fiscal which reduced our number of shares outstanding 
this reduction resulted in a benefit to our diluted net earnings per share of approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal outlook for fiscal fiscal was a difficult year as we faced the worst global recession in decades 
we are uncertain when we will begin to see recovery in our markets and how quickly the recovery will occur 
however  we have taken and continue to take proactive measures to manage through this tough economic environment 
we believe the key drivers for our fiscal financial performance will include  among many others  the following main factors international markets will continue to be a long term focus for us to grow our revenues 
we plan to continue investing in new products designed specifically for international markets and in infrastructure around the world that will connect us closer to international customers  increasing our global presence 
our goal is for international sales to comprise a larger percentage of our total consolidated net sales 
as we experienced a weak domestic economy during fiscal  we also experienced challenging economic conditions in our key international markets 
we anticipate economic conditions in some international markets will improve in fiscal and we expect our international business to slightly increase in fiscal compared to fiscal we anticipate fiscal net sales in our professional segment to be approximately equivalent to those in fiscal  as we expect a slow rebound of worldwide economies will continue to impact our professional markets during fiscal we expect budgets with municipalities to remain tight in fiscal  which may add downward pressure on our professional segment net sales in fiscal however  we plan to continue to enhance our professional segment product offering with innovative new and improved products 
in addition  we anticipate growth in the irrigation market for products that help conserve the use of water  namely for the commercial  residential  and agricultural markets  as the need to become more efficient in water use is expected to drive demand 
we plan to invest in new products  manufacturing capacity  and infrastructure globally as products used for water conservation are expected to be a long term focus for us 
our goal is for water related products to comprise a larger percentage of our total consolidated net sales 
despite the economic downturn we faced in fiscal  our residential segment performed relatively well with market share gains and additional product placement for our walk power mower and riding mower products 
as we anticipate a slow economic recovery in fiscal  we expect our residential segment net sales to be about even with fiscal net sales 
during fiscal  we anticipate our gross margin rate to improve compared to fiscal  assuming average costs paid for commodities in fiscal will be lower compared to the average prices paid for commodities in fiscal in addition  we plan to increase utilization at our manufacturing facilities by aggressively pursuing cost reduction efforts and increasing in sourcing of certain production 
although we anticipate net sales and sg a costs in fiscal to be equivalent to fiscal  we expect net earnings and diluted net earnings per share to be up in fiscal compared to fiscal  driven mainly by our expectation that our gross margin rate will increase in fiscal compared to fiscal  as well as a reduction in our diluted shares due to reduced shares outstanding from repurchases of our common stock 
in fiscal  we plan to continue our focus on improving asset utilization 
we anticipate a significant reduction in our net working capital as a percentage of net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal due to benefits from selling our receivables to red iron  as well as ongoing efforts to improve asset management 
consistent with our focus on asset management  domestic field inventory levels are within our expectations and we anticipate field inventory levels to be flat as of the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal we will continue to keep a cautionary eye on the global economies  retail demand  field inventory levels  commodity prices  weather  competitive actions  expenses  and other factors identified in part i  item a  risk factors of this report  which could cause our actual results to differ from our anticipated outlook 
results of operations fiscal net earnings were million compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of percent 
fiscal diluted net earnings per share were  a decrease of percent from per share in fiscal the primary factors contributing to the net earnings decline were lower sales volumes  a decline in gross margin  and an increase in other expense  somewhat offset by lower sg a expenses 
however  our net earnings per diluted share were benefited by approximately per share in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of reduced shares outstanding from repurchases of our common stock 
fiscal net earnings were million compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of percent 
fiscal diluted net earnings per share were  a decrease of percent from per share in fiscal the primary factors contributing to the net earnings decline were lower gross margins  a higher effective tax rate  and a decline in other income 
however  our net earnings per diluted share were benefited by approximately per share in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of reduced shares outstanding from repurchases of our common stock 
the following table summarizes our results of operations as a percentage of our consolidated net sales 
fiscal years ended october net sales cost of sales gross margin sg a expense interest expense other expense income  net provision for income taxes net earnings fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
worldwide net sales in fiscal were  million compared to  million in fiscal  a decrease of percent 
this net sales decline was primarily driven by lower shipments of domestic professional segment products largely resulting from the global recession 
a significant decline in international sales due also to reduced demand as a result of recessionary conditions affecting our key international markets  as well as a stronger average us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact business that accounted for approximately million of our net sales decrease 
a slight decline in residential segment net sales by percent in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily attributable to lower demand of riding products as a result of the poor economic conditions  despite customer acceptance for a new line of zero turn radius riding mowers  a decrease in electric blower product sales  and a decrease in sales of snow thrower products due to the timing of the introduction for a new redesigned offering of snow thrower products that shipped to customers in the first quarter of fiscal lower domestic field inventory levels as of the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal as our shipments decline more than retail demand  as well as improved field inventory management 
partially offsetting those negative factors were strong shipments of walk power mowers due to additional product placement at a key retailer and a new and broader line of walk power mowers 
gross margin 
gross margin represents gross profit net sales less cost of sales as a percentage of net sales 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  in the section entitled cost of sales  for a description of expenses included in cost of sales 
gross margin decreased by percentage points to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal this decline was mainly the result of the following factors lower sales of our higher margin products 
higher manufacturing costs from lower plant utilization as we cut production to align it with the decline in sales volumes  combined with our ongoing efforts to lower inventory levels 
a stronger average us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business 
somewhat offsetting those negative factors were a reduction in our last in first out lifo reserve of million that benefited our gross margin due to a significant decline in our inventory levels 
a decline in freight expense 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expense 
sg a expense decreased million  or percent  from fiscal see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  in the section entitled selling  general  and administrative expense  for a description of expenses included in sg a expense 
sg a expense rate represents sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales 
sg a expense rate in fiscal increased to percent compared to percent in fiscal due to fixed sg a costs spread over significantly lower sales volumes 
the following factors decreased our sg a expense overall reduced spending in response to the worldwide recessionary economic conditions 
a decline in incentive compensation expense of million due to lower than planned financial performance in fiscal offsetting those decreases were an increase in product liability costs of million as a result of unfavorable claims experience 
higher bad debt expense and costs for distributor changes of million 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased by percent compared to fiscal as a result of lower average short term debt levels and a decline in average interest rates 
other expense income  net 
other expense income  net consists mainly of interest income  financing revenue  litigation settlements and recoveries  currency exchange rate gains and losses  and equity losses from investments 
other expense  net for fiscal was million compared to other income  net of million in fiscal this increase in other expense  net was due mainly to the following factors expenses of million in the aggregate for several legal matters 
a decline in financing revenue of million 
lower interest income of million 
somewhat offsetting those increases were foreign currency exchange rate gains in fiscal of million compared to foreign currency exchange losses in fiscal of million 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent compared to percent in fiscal the realization of deferred tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded to the extent it is more likely than not that any portion of the deferred tax asset will not be recognized 
the increase in the effective tax rate was due to a valuation allowance of million for foreign subsidiaries net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets reflecting the uncertainty over their future realization 
this increase was partially offset by the tax impact of income from foreign jurisdictions subject to lower tax rates 
we anticipate our tax rate for fiscal to be approximately to percent  depending on whether and when the domestic research credit  which is currently set to expire on december   is extended 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
worldwide net sales in fiscal were  million compared to  million in fiscal  a slight increase of percent 
this net sales increase was primarily driven by increased international net sales that grew percent as a result of strong growth and demand for our products in international markets  particularly in the golf market  and the successful introduction of new products 
a weaker us dollar during most of fiscal compared to other currencies in which we transact business accounted for approximately million of our sales growth 
partially offsetting those positive factors were lower domestic shipments as a result of the weakening of the domestic economy and customers reluctance to place orders due to the uncertain economic environment 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased by percentage points to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal this decline was mainly the result of the following factors increased commodity and fuel costs 
higher manufacturing costs from lower plant utilization as we cut production in an effort to lower inventory levels 
increased tooling costs from accelerated depreciation of tooling no longer used and investments in tooling for new products 
somewhat offsetting those negative factors were price increases introduced on most products 
a weaker average us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business 
cost reduction efforts and productivity improvements as part of our growlean initiative 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expense 
sg a expense decreased million  or percent  from fiscal sg a expense rate in fiscal remained unchanged at percent compared to fiscal the following factors increased our sg a expense increased spending for marketing 
higher level of investments in engineering 
costs incurred in fiscal for workforce adjustments 
offsetting those increases were a decline in incentive compensation expense due to lower than planned financial performance in fiscal a decrease in product liability and self insurance costs attributable to favorable claims experience 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased slightly by percent compared to fiscal due to interest expense paid in fiscal on million in principal amount of notes that were repaid in june and a decline in average interest rates  somewhat offset by higher average debt levels 
other income  net 
other income  net for fiscal decreased million compared to fiscal this decrease was due mainly to the following factors foreign currency exchange rate losses in fiscal compared to foreign currency exchange rate gains in fiscal lower interest income 
a decline in financing revenue 
somewhat offsetting those decreases was higher litigation settlement recovery in fiscal compared to fiscal provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent compared to percent in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was due mainly to the tax impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in addition  our fiscal tax rate was benefited by the increase in benefits related to the domestic research credit as a result of the retroactive extension of this credit by the tax relief and health care act of performance by business segment as more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we operate in three reportable business segments professional  residential  and distribution 
our distribution segment  which consists of our company owned domestic distributorships  has been combined with our corporate activities and financing functions that is shown as other 
operating earnings for our professional and residential segments are defined as earnings from operations plus other expense income  net 
operating loss for the other segment includes earnings loss from wholly owned domestic distribution company operations  corporate activities  including corporate financing activities  other expense income  and interest expense 
the following information provides perspective on our business segments net sales and operating results 
professional professional segment net sales represented percent of consolidated net sales for fiscal and percent for each of fiscal and the following table shows the professional segment net sales  operating earnings  and operating earnings as a percent of net sales 
dollars in millions fiscal years ended october net sales   change from prior year operating earnings as a percent of net sales net sales 
worldwide net sales for the professional segment in fiscal were significantly down by percent compared to fiscal primarily from lower shipments for most domestic and international product categories due to decreased demand largely as a result of the worldwide recessionary economic conditions 
in addition  professional segment sales were down due to the following other factors a significant decrease in sales of golf maintenance equipment and irrigation systems as customers delayed investments in new equipment at existing golf courses and new golf course construction slowed 
a decline in sales of residential commercial irrigation systems as a result of weakness in the housing and commercial construction markets 
a stronger average us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business 
decreased sales of landscape contractor equipment  despite the fact that our new products  which included our next generation of zero turn radius riding mowers and grandstand stand on mowers  were well received by customers 
lower domestic field inventory levels as of the end of fiscal as compared to the end of fiscal as our shipments declined more than retail demand  as well as improved field inventory management 
worldwide net sales for the professional segment in fiscal were up percent compared to fiscal higher international shipments led this increase as a result of strong demand and growth in international markets  particularly in the golf market  as well as a weaker us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact business 
in addition  the success of new products introduced within the past two years resulted in higher equipment product sales for fiscal somewhat offsetting those positive factors were lower domestic product shipments as a result of decreased demand due to the weak domestic economy  as well as the poor domestic housing market that led to a decline in professionally installed irrigation systems 
our domestic field inventory levels were also down as of the end of fiscal as compared to the end of fiscal operating earnings 
operating earnings for the professional segment in fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  professional segment operating margins decreased to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the following factors negatively impacted professional segment operating earnings lower gross margins in fiscal compared to fiscal due to higher manufacturing costs from lower plant utilization as we cut production to align it with the decline in sales volumes  combined with our continued efforts to lower inventory levels 
in addition  a stronger average us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business also hampered professional segment gross margins  as well as higher tooling costs from investments in tools for new products 
higher sg a expense rate in fiscal compared to fiscal due mainly to fixed sg a costs spread over lower sales volumes  as well as higher product liability expense 
operating earnings for the professional segment in fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  professional segment operating margins decreased to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the operating profit decline was due mainly to lower gross margins as a result of increased commodity costs and fuel prices  as well as higher manufacturing costs from lower plant utilization  which were somewhat offset by price increases on most products  cost reduction efforts  and a weaker average us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business 
a higher sg a expense rate also hampered operating earnings due to investments in engineering and marketing  partially offset by a decline in product liability and warranty expense from favorable claims experience 
residential residential segment net sales represented percent of consolidated net sales for fiscal and percent for each of fiscal and the following table shows the residential segment net sales  operating earnings  and operating earnings as a percent of net sales 
dollars in millions fiscal years ended october net sales change from prior year operating earnings as a percent of net sales net sales 
worldwide net sales for the residential segment in fiscal were slightly down by percent compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the following factors a decline in international residential segment net sales due to poor economic conditions in europe  as well as a stronger us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business 
shipments of riding products were also down due to decreased demand primarily resulting from the recessionary economic conditions 
a decrease in electric blower product sales as a result of lost product placement at a mass retailer 
lower sales of snow thrower products as a result of the timing of the introduction for a new redesigned offering of snow thrower products that shipped to customers in the first quarter of fiscal somewhat offsetting those negative factors were increased shipments of walk power mowers as a result of additional product placement at a key retailer and a new and broader line of walk power mowers 
positive customer response for our new line of zero turn radius riding mowers 
worldwide net sales for the residential segment in fiscal were slightly up by percent compared to fiscal this increase was due primarily to strong snow thrower product sales in north america due to heavy snow falls during the winter season of and low field inventory levels entering the winter season 
in addition  strong demand in international markets  mainly for riding products and pope products sold in australia  also contributed to the residential segment sales growth 
somewhat offsetting those positive factors was lower demand for walk power mowers as a result of the weak domestic economy and poor spring weather  as well as a reduction in product placement and increased competitive pressure for walk power mowers 
electric trimmer product shipments were also down due to lost placement at a key retailer 
operating earnings 
operating earnings for the residential segment in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  residential segment operating margins improved to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the following factors impacted residential segment operating earnings a slight improvement in gross margins primarily from a decrease in freight expense  as well as a decline in tooling expense resulting from accelerated depreciation of tooling in fiscal that was no longer used 
these favorable improvements to residential segment gross margins were somewhat offset by unfavorable product mix and a stronger average us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business 
a decline in sg a expense from lower spending for marketing  engineering  administration  and warehousing costs as a result of budget reductions 
operating earnings for the residential segment in fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  residential segment operating margins declined to percent compared to percent in fiscal due to lower gross margins primarily from increased commodity costs and tooling expense 
a higher sg a expense rate also contributed to the operating earnings decline due mainly to increased spending for marketing 
other dollars in millions fiscal years ended october net sales change from prior year operating loss net sales 
net sales for the other segment includes sales from our wholly owned domestic distribution companies less sales from the professional and residential segments to those distribution companies 
in addition  elimination of the professional and residential segments floor plan interest costs from toro credit company tcc are also included in this segment 
during october  tcc sold its receivable portfolio to red iron 
the other segment net sales in fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal due to reduced demand largely resulting from the domestic economic recession  as well as a reduction in the elimination of floor plan interest costs as a result of lower receivables with tcc and a reduction in interest rates 
the other segment net sales in fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal as a result of the weakening of the domestic economy and the sale of a portion of the operations of one of our company owned distributorships in the first quarter of fiscal operating loss 
operating loss for the other segment in fiscal decreased by percent compared to fiscal this loss decrease was primarily attributable to overall reduced spending in response to the economic downturn  foreign currency exchange rate gains in fiscal compared to foreign currency exchange rate losses in fiscal  a decrease in incentive compensation expense  and a decline in interest expense  somewhat offset by expenses for several legal matters  an increase in bad debt expense  and higher costs for distributor changes 
operating loss for the other segment in fiscal increased by percent compared to fiscal this loss increase was primarily attributable to foreign currency exchange rate losses in fiscal compared to foreign currency exchange rate gains in fiscal and costs incurred in fiscal for workforce adjustments  somewhat offset by a decrease in incentive compensation expense 
financial condition working capital we have taken proactive measures to improve working capital utilization during the tough economic environment  including adjusting production plans  controlling costs  and managing our assets 
as such  our financial condition remains strong 
we continue to place emphasis on asset management  with a focus on minimizing the amount of working capital in the supply chain and maintaining or improving order replenishment and service levels to end users 
in connection with our recently established joint venture with tcfif  we sold certain receivables  including floor plan and open account receivables  from most us and canadian distributors and dealers of our products at a purchase price equal to the face value of the receivables or the purchase price paid for such receivables 
the joint venture began financing floor plan receivables in the fourth quarter of fiscal the joint venture also began financing open account receivables  as well as floor plan receivables previously financed by a third party financing company  during our first quarter of fiscal the sale of these receivables makes our working capital available for other strategic purposes  such as strategic acquisitions  research and development of innovative new products  improvements in the quality and performance of existing products  and general corporate purposes 
the following table highlights several key measures of our working capital performance 
dollars in millions fiscal years ended october average cash and cash equivalents average receivables  net average inventories  net average accounts payable average days outstanding for receivables average inventory turnover x x average receivables  net decreased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal  and average days outstanding for receivables decreased to days in fiscal compared to days in fiscal due in part to lower average field inventory levels as our customers focused on improving asset management  as well as the sale of our floor plan receivables to red iron during the fourth quarter of fiscal average net inventories decreased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal  and average inventory turnover improved by percent in fiscal compared to fiscal as we curtailed production levels and continued our focus to improve asset management 
we expect average receivables and average days outstanding for receivables in fiscal to significantly decrease compared to fiscal as a result of the sale of our floor plan receivables and certain open account receivables to red iron 
we expect average inventories to also decline in fiscal compared to fiscal and we anticipate average inventory turnover to improve in fiscal compared to fiscal as we plan to continue our efforts to improve asset utilization 
capital expenditures and other long term assets fiscal capital expenditures of million were percent lower compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to spending reductions in response to the recessionary economic conditions 
capital expenditures for fiscal are anticipated to be approximately to million as we plan to continue to invest in new product tooling  replacement production equipment  and expansion of our vertical integration capabilities 
long term assets as of october  were million compared to million as of october   a slight increase of percent 
this increase was due primarily to the addition of intangible assets from an acquisition 
capital structure the following table details the components of our total capitalization and key ratios 
dollars in millions october short term debt long term debt  including current portion stockholders equity debt to capitalization ratio our debt to capitalization ratio was higher in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a decrease in stockholders equity as we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock  as well as a decline in net earnings 
liquidity and capital resources our businesses are seasonally working capital intensive and require funding for purchases of raw materials used in production  replacement parts inventory  payroll and other administrative costs  capital expenditures  expansion and upgrading of existing facilities  as well as for financing receivables from customers 
we believe that cash generated from operations  together with our fixed rate long term debt  bank credit lines  and cash on hand  will provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our anticipated operating requirements 
one of the purposes of establishing the joint venture with tcfif  as previously discussed  is to free up our working capital for other strategic purposes  which may include  among other things  strategic acquisitions  research and development of innovative new products  improvements in the quality and performance of existing products  and general corporate purposes 
we believe that the funds available through existing financing arrangements and forecasted cash flows will be sufficient to provide the necessary capital resources for our anticipated working capital needs  capital expenditures  investments  debt repayments  quarterly cash dividend payments  and stock repurchases for at least the next twelve months 
cash dividends each quarter in fiscal and  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share 
our board of directors recently increased our first quarter of fiscal quarterly cash dividend by percent to per share from the quarterly cash dividend paid in the first quarter of fiscal cash flow cash flows provided by used in operating  investing  and financing activities during the past three fiscal years are shown in the following table 
dollars in millions cash provided by used in fiscal years ended october operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash net cash provided cash and cash equivalents as of fiscal year end cash flows provided by operating activities 
our primary source of funds is cash generated from operations 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities increased percent from fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to cash received from the sale of million of floor plan receivables to red iron  as well as a decline in inventory levels in fiscal compared to fiscal  somewhat offset by a decrease in net earnings 
cash flows used in investing activities 
capital expenditures and acquisitions are our primary uses of capital resources 
these investments are intended to enable sales growth in diverse and new markets and products  help us to meet product demand  and increase our manufacturing efficiencies 
cash used in investing activities decreased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal due mainly to a decline in purchases of property  plant  and equipment  somewhat offset by an increase in investments in affiliates and acquisitions 
cash flows used in financing activities 
cash used in financing activities decreased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to an increase of proceeds and tax benefits from stock based awards in fiscal compared to fiscal  which was somewhat offset by higher levels of funds used to repurchase our common stock in fiscal compared to fiscal credit lines and other capital resources our businesses are seasonal  with accounts receivable balances historically increasing between january and april  as a result of higher sales volumes and extended payment terms made available to our customers and decreasing between may and december when payments are received 
the seasonality of production and shipments causes our working capital requirements to fluctuate during the year 
our peak borrowing usually occurs between january and april 
seasonal cash requirements are financed from operations and with short term financing arrangements  including a million unsecured senior five year revolving credit facility that expires in january interest expense on this credit line is determined based on a libor rate plus a basis point spread defined in the credit agreement 
in addition  our non us operations maintain unsecured short term lines of credit of approximately million 
these facilities bear interest at various rates depending on the rates in their respective countries of operation 
we also have a letter of credit subfacility as part of our credit agreement 
as of october   we had million of outstanding standby letters of credit 
average short term debt was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or percent 
this decline was primarily attributable to a decrease in our working capital needs in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of lower accounts receivable and inventory levels  as previously discussed 
as of october   we had million of unutilized availability under our credit agreements 
significant financial covenants in our credit agreement include interest coverage and debt to capitalization ratios 
we were in compliance with all covenants related to our credit agreement as of october   and we expect to be in compliance with all covenants during fiscal our credit agreement requires compliance with all of the covenants defined in the agreement 
if we were out of compliance with any debt covenant required by our credit agreement following the applicable cure period  the banks could terminate their commitments unless we could negotiate a covenant waiver from the banks 
in addition  our long term senior notes and debentures could become due and payable if we were unable to obtain a covenant waiver or refinance our short term debt under our credit agreement 
if our credit rating falls below investment grade and or our average debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda ratio rises above a certain level  the interest rate we currently pay on our outstanding short term debt under the credit agreement would increase 
however  the credit commitment could not be cancelled by the banks based solely on a ratings downgrade 
our debt rating for long term unsecured senior  non credit enhanced debt was unchanged during fiscal by standard and poor s ratings group at bbb and by moody s investors service at baa share repurchase plan during fiscal  we continued repurchasing shares of our common stock as a means of using excess cash and reducing our shares outstanding 
in addition  our repurchase programs provided shares for use in connection with our equity compensation programs 
in july  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  shares of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
this repurchase authorization has no expiration date but may be terminated by our board of directors at any time 
as of october    shares remained available for repurchase under our board authorization 
the following table provides information with respect to repurchases of our common stock during the past three fiscal years

third party financing companies and affiliates purchase selected receivables from us and our distributors and dealers for extended periods that assist our distributors and dealers in carrying representative inventories of our products 
under these financing arrangements  down payments are not required and  depending on the finance program for each product line  finance charges are incurred by us  shared between us and the distributor and or the dealer  or paid by the distributor or dealer 
the financing company retains a security interest in the distributors and dealers financed inventories  and those inventories are monitored regularly 
floor plan terms to the distributors and dealers require payment as the equipment  which secures the indebtedness  is sold to customers  or when payment terms become due  whichever occurs first 
rates are generally indexed to libor plus a fixed percentage that differs based on whether the financing is for a distributor or dealer 
rates may also vary based on the product that is financed 
historically  tcc  our wholly owned finance subsidiary  provided financing for select products we manufacture for and sell to our us distributors  select distributors of our products in canada  and approximately select us dealers 
during october  tcc sold its receivable portfolio to red iron  a recently established joint venture between toro and tcfif 
red iron provides inventory financing  including floor plan and open account receivable financing  to distributors and dealers of our products in the us and to select distributors of our products in canada 
in connection with the establishment of the joint venture  we terminated our agreement with the third party financing company that previously provided floor plan financing to dealers of our products in the us and canada  and red iron began financing new receivables during the first quarter of fiscal third party financing companies and red iron purchased million of receivables from us during fiscal  of which million was outstanding as of october  we also enter into limited inventory repurchase agreements with third party financing companies and red iron for receivables sold by us to third party financing companies and red iron 
as of october   we were contingently liable to repurchase up to million of inventory related to receivables under these financing arrangements 
we have repurchased immaterial amounts of inventory from third party financing companies over the past three fiscal years 
however  a decline in retail sales or financial difficulties of our distributors or dealers could cause this situation to change and thereby require us to repurchase financed product  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
end user financing 
we have agreements with third party financing companies to provide lease financing options to golf course and sports fields and grounds equipment customers in the us and europe 
the purpose of these agreements is to increase sales by giving buyers of our products alternative financing options when purchasing our products 
during fiscal  we entered into an amended agreement with a third party financing company that eliminated our contingent liability for any residual value risk on the underlying equipment financed under this program 
in addition  under the terms of the amended agreement  we are only contingently liable for a portion of the credit collection risk for leases entered into prior to the effective date of the amended agreement 
our maximum exposure for credit collection as of october  was million 
termination or any material change to the terms of our end user financing arrangements  availability of credit for our customers  including any delay in securing replacement credit sources  or significant financed product repurchase requirements could have a material impact on our future operating results 
distributor financing 
from time to time  we enter into long term loan agreements with some distributors 
these transactions are used for expansion of the distributors businesses  acquisitions  refinancing working capital agreements  or facilitation of ownership changes 
as of october  and  we had outstanding notes receivable in the aggregate of million and million  respectively  from two distribution companies 
the amounts are included in other current and long term assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october  payments due by period dollars in thousands contractual obligation less than year years years more than years total long term debt     short term debt   interest payments     deferred compensation arrangements     purchase obligations   operating leases      total      principal payments and recourse accounts with red iron 
the unfunded deferred compensation arrangements  covering certain current and retired management employees  consists primarily of salary and bonus deferrals under our deferred compensation plans 
our estimated distributions in the contractual obligations table are based upon a number of assumptions including termination dates and participant elections 
deferred compensation balances earn interest based on rates of return on funds established by the compensation and human resources committee of the board of directors  and are payable at the election of the participants 
operating lease obligations do not include payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance 
as of october   we also had million in outstanding letters of credit issued during the normal course of business  as required by some vendor contracts 
in addition to the above contractual obligations  we may be obligated for additional cash outflows of million of unrecognized tax benefits 
the payment and timing of any such payments is affected by the ultimate resolution of the tax years that are under audit or remain subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
market risk due to the nature and scope of our operations  we are subject to exposures that arise from fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
we are also exposed to equity market risk pertaining to the trading price of our common stock 
additional information is presented in part ii  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
inflation we are subject to the effects of inflation and changing prices 
during the first half of fiscal  we experienced higher average commodity costs compared to the average prices paid for commodities in fiscal during the second half of fiscal  prices paid for commodities declined  which offset the negative impact of higher commodity costs on our gross margin rate during the first half of fiscal we will continue to closely follow the commodities that affect our product lines  and we anticipate average prices paid for commodities to be lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal we plan to attempt to mitigate the impact of inflationary pressures by engaging in proactive vendor negotiations  reviewing alternative sourcing options  substituting materials  engaging in internal cost reduction efforts  and increasing prices on some of our products  as appropriate 
acquisitions and divestiture in fiscal  we completed the purchase of certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of ty crop manufacturing ltd  a leading manufacturer of topdressing and material handling equipment for golf course and sports fields applications 
the acquisition of ty crop s topdressing and material handling equipment enhances our product offering of application and cultivation equipment to help customers achieve improved agronomic conditions of turf 
in fiscal  we completed the purchase of certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of southern green  inc  a leading manufacturer of deep tine aeration equipment 
the acquisition of southern green s versatile line of soil reliever aerators increased our offering of highly productive turf cultivation equipment and provided entry into a new product category for our golf course and sports field markets 
in fiscal  we also completed the purchase of turf guard wireless monitoring technology from jlh labs  llc  a leader in wireless soil monitoring technology 
the turf guard system is designed to measure soil moisture  salinity  and temperature through buried wireless sensors that communicate data to an internet server for processing and presentation to a user through the web 
in fiscal  we also completed the sale of a portion of the operations of one of our company owned distributorships 
in fiscal  we completed the acquisition of rain master irrigation systems  inc rain master manufactures irrigation central controllers and other products for the commercial landscape market 
in fiscal  we also completed the purchase of certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of allen hover mower 
allen hover mower sells walk power mowers worldwide for the golf course and grounds maintenance markets that are specifically designed to perform well on steep inclines 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  we must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances  historical experience  and actuarial valuations 
actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria i the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and ii different estimates reasonably could have been used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
our critical accounting estimates include the following warranty reserve 
warranty coverage on our products ranges from a period of six months to seven years  and generally covers parts  labor  and other expenses for non maintenance repairs 
warranty coverage generally does not cover operator abuse or improper use 
at the time of sale  we accrue a warranty reserve by product line for estimated costs in connection with future warranty claims 
we also establish reserves for major rework campaigns 
the amount of our warranty reserves is based primarily on the estimated number of products under warranty  historical average costs incurred to service warranty claims  the trend in the historical ratio of claims to sales  and the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our warranty reserves based on changes in these factors and record any necessary adjustments if actual claim experience indicates that adjustments are necessary 
actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation due to such factors as performance of new products  significant manufacturing or design defects not discovered until after the product is delivered to customers  product failure rates  and higher or lower than expected service costs for a repair 
we believe that analysis of historical trends and knowledge of potential manufacturing or design problems provide sufficient information to establish a reasonable estimate for warranty claims at the time of sale 
however  since we cannot predict with certainty future warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims  our actual warranty costs may differ from our estimates 
an unexpected increase in warranty claims or in the costs associated with servicing those claims would result in an increase in our warranty accrual and a decrease in our net earnings 
sales promotions and incentives 
at the time of sale to a customer  we record an estimate for sales promotion and incentive costs which are classified as a reduction from gross sales or as a component of sg a expense 
examples of sales promotion and incentive programs include rebate programs on certain professional products sold to distributors  volume discounts  retail financing support  floor planning  cooperative advertising  commissions  and other sales discounts and promotional programs 
the estimates for sales promotion and incentive costs are based on the terms of the arrangements with customers  historical payment experience  field inventory levels  volume purchases  and expectations for changes in relevant trends in the future 
actual results may differ from these estimates if competitive factors dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive accruals or if customer usage and field inventory levels vary from historical trends 
adjustments to sales promotions and incentive accruals are made from time to time as actual usage becomes known in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to generate consumer demand based on market conditions as of the balance sheet date 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventories at the lower of the cost of inventory or net realizable value  with cost determined by either the lifo method for most us inventories or the first in  first out fifo method for all other inventories 
we establish reserves for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventory based on inventory levels  expected product life  and forecasted sales demand 
valuation of inventory can also be affected by significant redesign of existing products or replacement of an existing product by an entirely new generation product 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with inventory levels 
reserve requirements are developed according to our projected demand requirements based on historical demand  competitive factors  and technological and product life cycle changes 
it is possible that an increase in our reserve may be required in the future if there is a significant decline in demand for our products and we do not adjust our manufacturing production accordingly 
we also record a reserve for inventory shrinkage 
our inventory shrinkage reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses that are recorded based on historical loss trends  ongoing cycle count and periodic testing adjustments  and inventory levels 
though management considers reserve balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which we operate could have an effect on the reserve balances required 
accounts and notes receivable valuation 
we value accounts and notes receivable  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
each fiscal quarter  we prepare an analysis of our ability to collect outstanding receivables that provides a basis for an allowance estimate for doubtful accounts 
in doing so  we evaluate the age of our receivables  past collection history  current financial conditions of key customers  and economic conditions 
based on this evaluation  we establish a reserve for specific accounts and notes receivable that we believe are uncollectible  as well as an estimate of uncollectible receivables not specifically known 
a deterioration in the financial condition of any key customer  inability of customers to obtain bank credit lines  or a significant slow down in the economy could have a material negative impact on our ability to collect a portion or all of the accounts and notes receivable 
we believe that an analysis of historical trends and our current knowledge of potential collection problems provide us with sufficient information to establish a reasonable estimate for an allowance for doubtful accounts 
however  since we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers or in the general economy  our actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
in the event we determined that a smaller or larger uncollectible accounts reserve is appropriate  we would record a credit or charge to sg a expense in the period that we made such a determination 
new accounting pronouncements to be adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  and sfas no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no

r to any business combination occurring on or after november   as required 
no other new accounting pronouncement that has been issued but not yet effective for us during fiscal has had or is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
we are also exposed to equity market risk pertaining to the trading price of our common stock 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flows 
see further discussions on these market risks below 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in the normal course of business  we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency exchange rate market risk by entering into various hedging instruments  authorized under company policies that place controls on these activities  with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions 
our hedging activities involve the primary use of forward currency contracts 
we use derivative instruments only in an attempt to limit underlying exposure from currency fluctuations and to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes and not for trading purposes 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business  such as sales and loans to wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  foreign plant operations  and purchases from suppliers 
because our products are manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states and mexico  a stronger us dollar and mexican peso generally has a negative impact on our results from operations  while a weaker dollar and peso generally has a positive effect 
our primary currency exchange rate exposures are with the euro  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  the british pound  the mexican peso  and the japanese yen against the us dollar 
we enter into various contracts  principally forward contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change  to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  anticipated sales  and probable commitments 
decisions on whether to use such contracts are made based on the amount of exposures to the currency involved and an assessment of the near term market value for each currency 
worldwide foreign currency exchange rate exposures are reviewed monthly 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in market values of the related exposures 
therefore  changes in market values of these hedge instruments are highly correlated with changes in market values of underlying hedged items both at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract 
during fiscal  the amount of gains treated as an increase to net sales for contracts to hedge sales were million 
during fiscal and  the amount of losses treated as a reduction of net sales for contracts to hedge sales were million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  the losses treated as an increase to costs of sales for contracts to hedge inventory purchases were million 
during fiscal and  the gains treated as a reduction to cost of sales for contracts to hedge inventory purchases were million and million  respectively 
the following foreign currency exchange contracts held by us have maturity dates in fiscal and all items are non trading and stated in us dollars 
some derivative instruments we enter into do not meet the cash flow hedging criteria  therefore  changes in fair value are recorded in other expense income  net 
the average contracted rate  notional amount  pre tax value of derivative instruments in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl  and fair value impact of derivative instruments in other expense income  net as of and for the fiscal year ended october  were as follows dollars in thousands except average contracted rate average contracted rate notional amount value in aocl income loss fair value impact loss gain buy us sell canadian dollar buy us sell australian dollar buy us sell euro buy us sell british pound buy australian dollar sell us buy mexican peso sell us our net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars is not hedged 
any changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity  and would not impact net earnings 
interest rate risk 
our market risk on interest rates relates primarily to libor based short term debt from commercial banks  as well as the potential increase in fair value of long term debt resulting from a potential decrease in interest rates 
however  we do not have a cash flow or earnings exposure due to market risks on long term debt 
we generally do not use interest rate swaps to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
assuming a hypothetical increase of one percent basis points in short term interest rates  with all other variables remaining constant  including the average balance of short term debt outstanding during fiscal  interest expense would have increased million in fiscal included in long term debt is million of fixed rate debt that is not subject to variable interest rate fluctuations 
as a result  we have no earnings or cash flow exposure due to market risks on our long term debt obligations 
as of october   the estimated fair value of long term debt with fixed interest rates was million compared to its carrying amount of million 
the fair value is estimated by discounting the projected cash flows using the rate that similar amounts and terms of debt could currently be borrowed 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we entered into three treasury lock agreements based on a year us treasury security with a principal balance of million for two of the agreements and million for the third agreement 
these treasury lock agreements provided for a single payment at maturity  which was april   based on the change in value of the reference treasury security 
these agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and resulted in a net settlement of million 
this loss was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  and will be amortized to interest expense over the year term of the senior notes 
commodity risk 
we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain purchased commodity raw materials including steel  aluminum  fuel  petroleum based resin  and linerboard 
in addition  we are a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities  including steel  aluminum  copper  lead  rubber  and others which are integrated into our end products 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations 
we generally buy these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process 
we generally attempt to obtain firm pricing from most of our suppliers for volumes consistent with planned production 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers  or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices  we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies to offset increases in commodity costs 
further information regarding rising prices for commodities is presented in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report in the section entitled inflation 
we enter into fixed price contracts for future purchases of natural gas in the normal course of operations as a means to manage natural gas price risks 
these contracts meet the definition of normal purchases or normal sales and therefore  are not considered derivative instruments for accounting purposes 
our manufacturing facilities enter into these fixed price contracts for approximately to percent of their monthly anticipated usage 
equity price risk 
the trading price volatility of toro common stock impacts compensation expense related to our stock based compensation plans 
further information is presented in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements regarding our stock based compensation plans
