item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the timberland company and its subsidiaries we  our  us  its  timberland or the company  as well as our liquidity and capital resources 
the discussion  including known trends and uncertainties identified by management  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
included herein with respect to versus and versus comparisons are discussions and reconciliations of i total company  europe and asia revenue changes to constant dollar revenue changes  and ii net income and diluted earnings per share eps to net income excluding restructuring and related costs and diluted eps excluding restructuring and related costs  respectively 
constant dollar revenue changes  which exclude the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates  and net income and diluted eps  each excluding restructuring and related costs are not performance measures recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the difference between changes in reported revenue the most comparable gaap measure and constant dollar revenue changes is the impact of movement in foreign currencies 
we provide constant dollar revenue changes for total company  europe and asia results because we use the measure to understand the underlying changes in our 
table of contents growth of revenue excluding the impact of items that are not under management s direct control  such as changes in foreign exchange rates 
the limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on the company s revenue 
this limitation is best addressed by using constant dollar revenue changes in combination with the gaap numbers 
we provide net income and diluted eps excluding restructuring and related costs because we use these measures to analyze the earnings of the company 
management believes these measures are a reasonable reflection of the underlying earnings levels and trends from core business activities  as well as more indicative of future results 
the difference between net income and diluted eps excluding restructuring and related costs and their most comparable gaap measures net income and diluted eps is the impact of restructuring and related charges that may mask our underlying operating results and or business trends 
the limitation of these measures is that they exclude items that would otherwise decrease the company s net income and diluted eps 
these limitations are best addressed by using such measures in combination with the most comparable gaap measures in order to better understand the amounts  character and impact  if any  of any increase or decrease on reported results

table of contents in  timberland was recognized as an outdoor industry business innovator by the outdoor industry association and named to ethisphere magazine s world s most ethical companies list 
we were also included in working mother magazine s list of best green companies for america s children  and were the first company to receive leed leadership in energy and environmental design certification for two of our mall based retail stores 
mediaweek magazine also named timberland a media plan of the year award winner for our eco conscious media plan for the launch of our earthkeepers tm product line 
outlook the company anticipates that will continue to be challenging due to uncertainty around consumer spending patterns and the financial health of the retail industry in general  conditions that make forecasting difficult 
given the volatile nature of current economic conditions  the company believes there is not sufficient visibility to set expectations for the performance of the business at this time 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns and allowances  realization of outstanding accounts receivable  the carrying value of inventories  derivatives  other contingencies  impairment of assets  incentive compensation accruals  shared based compensation and the provision for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
historically  actual results have not been materially different from our estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates used in applying our critical accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements sales returns and allowances our revenue consists of sales to wholesale customers including distributors and franchisees  retail store and e commerce revenues  license fees and royalties 
we record wholesale and e commerce revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to our customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment to or upon receipt by our customer  depending on the country of sale and the agreement with our customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of the sale 
license fees and royalties are recognized as earned per the terms of our licensing and royalty agreements 
we also sell gift cards 
revenue from gift cards is recognized at the time of redemption 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated wholesale and retail customer returns and allowances in the same period the related sales are recorded 
we base our estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances  as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns and allowances  which are known to us but which have not yet been received 
our total reserves for sales returns and allowances were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the actual amount of customer returns and allowances may differ from our estimates 
if we determine that increases or decreases to sales returns and allowances are appropriate  we record either a reduction or an increase in sales in the period in which we make such a determination 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing estimates for losses relating to our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate potential losses primarily based upon our historical rate of credit losses and our knowledge of the financial condition of our customers 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
historically  losses have been within our expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  adjustments may be required to these estimates 
if we determine that increases or decreases to the allowance for doubtful accounts are appropriate  we record either an increase or decrease to selling expense in the period in which we make such a determination 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out or market value 
market value is estimated based upon assumptions made about future demand and retail market conditions 
if we determine that the estimated market value of our inventory is less than the carrying value of the inventory  we provide a reserve for the difference as a charge to cost of sales 
our reserves related to inventory valuation totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
if actual market conditions are more or less favorable than our estimates  adjustments to our inventory reserves may be required 
the adjustments would decrease or increase our cost of sales in the period in which they are recognized 
derivatives we are routinely subject to currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and cash flows as we purchase and sell goods in foreign markets in their local currencies 
we use derivative instruments  specifically forward contracts  to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on a portion of our forecasted foreign currency exposures 
these derivatives are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet 
changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedge instruments are recorded in other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of income see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
for our derivative contracts that have been designated as hedge instruments  the effective portion of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the period that the transaction that is subject to the related hedge contract is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of the hedge is reported in other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of income 
we use our operating budget and forecasts to estimate future economic exposure and to determine the levels and timing of derivative transactions intended to mitigate such exposures in accordance with our risk management policies 
we closely monitor our foreign currency exposure and adjust our derivative positions accordingly 
our estimates of anticipated transactions could fluctuate over time and could vary from the ultimate transactions 
future operating results could be impacted by adjustments to these estimates and changes in foreign currency forward rates 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liabilities  trademark rights and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is estimable 
we record a contingent liability when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
estimating probable losses requires analysis and judgment about the potential actions 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
we do not believe that any pending legal proceeding or claims will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability  we would record additional expense during the period in which the loss or change in estimate occurred 

table of contents goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually at the end of our second fiscal quarter and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the value of the asset below its carrying amount  using forecasts of discounted future cash flows 
events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions  economic factors  technological changes and loss of key personnel 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets totaled million and million  respectively  at december  estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth  asset related expenditures  working capital levels and other factors 
different assumptions from those made in the company s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
those estimates of discounted cash flows could differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to business operations or technological changes 
should the fair value of the company s goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  or as a result of changes in the discount rate  charges for impairment may be necessary 
no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived assets occurred in  and see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset may be impaired  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  impairment is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the estimate of its fair market value 
we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about expected future operating performance 
those estimates of undiscounted cash flows could differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to business operations or technological change 
in  an impairment of million related to the carrying value of an intangible asset was recorded see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
for  we recorded impairment charges of million associated with the closure of certain of our retail stores see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding the company s global retail portfolio review 
in  no significant impairment related to the carrying value of our long lived assets was recorded 
incentive compensation accruals we use incentive compensation plans to link compensation to the achievement of specific annual performance targets 
we accrue for this liability during each year based on certain estimates and assumptions 
the amount paid  based on actual performance  could differ from our accrual 
share based compensation the company estimates the fair value of its stock option awards and employee stock purchase plan the esp plan rights on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes model includes various assumptions  including the expected volatility for stock options and esp plan rights and the expected term of stock options 
these assumptions reflect the company s best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the company s control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  share based compensation expense  as calculated and recorded under sfas r could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if the company uses different assumptions in future periods  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding the company s share based compensation 

table of contents income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon temporary book to tax differences and to recognize tax attributes  such as tax loss carryforwards and credits 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the value of these assets 
if we were unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions  an adjustment could be required in the net carrying value of the deferred tax assets  which would result in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for any valuation allowance quarterly 
we estimate the effective tax rate for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  the estimate is refined based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to the expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision reflects the expected annual rate 
the company recognizes the impact of a tax position in our financial statements if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority  based on its technical merits 
we exercise our judgment in determining whether a position meets the more likely than not threshold for recognition  based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position in light of all available evidence 
in measuring the liability  we consider amounts and probabilities of outcomes that could be realized upon settlement with taxing authorities using the facts  circumstances and information available at the balance sheet date 
these reflect the company s best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties 
as a result  if new information becomes available  the company s judgments and estimates may change 
a change in judgment relating to a tax position taken in a prior annual period will be recognized as a discrete item in the period in which the change occurs 
a change in judgment relating to a tax position taken in a prior interim period within the same fiscal year will be reflected through our effective tax rate

the company s north america revenue decreased to million in  primarily driven by anticipated sales declines in boots and kids footwear  driven in part by a reduction of sales through off price channels in the wholesale market as compared to  declines in timberland brand apparel  due in part to the transition of the north american men s and women s apparel business to a licensing arrangement  and lower sales of men s casual and performance footwear 
these declines were partially offset by strong growth in timberland pro footwear and apparel  and smartwool apparel and accessories 
within north america  our retail revenue decreased to million from million in  driven primarily by decreases in timberland apparel and accessories and boots

these impacts were partially offset by favorable changes in our sales channel and product mix in north america  as well as the impact of lower close out and off price channel activity reflecting the benefit of actions taken earlier in the year to drive down excess and obsolete inventory levels 
we also realized a slight benefit from foreign exchange rate changes 
we include the costs of procuring inventory inbound freight and duty  overhead and other similar costs in cost of goods sold 
these costs amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily driven by lower costs associated with our apparel sourcing as we transitioned to a licensing arrangement in north america

we include the costs of physically managing inventory warehousing and handling costs in selling expense 
these costs totaled million and million in and  respectively

derivative instruments expose us to credit and market risk 
the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions being hedged 
as a matter of policy  we only enter into derivative contracts with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating 
credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties 
we do not believe there is a significant risk of loss in the event of non performance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a group of major financial institutions and have varying maturities through january additionally  consumer spending is being affected by the current macro economic environment  particularly the disruption of the credit and stock markets 
continued deterioration in the markets could adversely impact our customers and their ability to access credit 
although impact from the current economic environment is reflected in our top line results  our cash flow and cash receipts continue to be strong 
we may utilize our committed and uncommitted lines of credit to fund our seasonal working capital needs 
we have not experienced any restrictions on the availability of these lines and the adverse capital and credit market conditions are not expected to significantly affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs 
credit facilities we have an unsecured committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks which matures on june  the agreement 
the agreement provides for million of committed borrowings  of which up to million may be used for letters of credit 
upon approval of the bank group  we may increase the committed borrowing limit by million for a total commitment of million 
under the terms of the agreement  we may borrow at interest rates based on eurodollar rates approximately at december   plus an applicable margin of between and basis points  based on a fixed charge coverage grid that is adjusted quarterly 
as of december   the applicable margin under the facility was basis points 
we will pay a utilization fee of an additional basis points if our outstanding borrowings under the facility exceed million 
we also pay a commitment fee of to basis points per annum on the total commitment  based on a fixed charge coverage grid that is adjusted quarterly 
as of december   the commitment fee was basis points 
the agreement places certain limitations on additional debt  stock repurchases  acquisitions  and the amount of dividends we may pay  and includes certain other financial and non financial covenants 
the primary financial covenants relate to maintaining a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of and a maximum leverage ratio of we measure compliance with the financial and non financial covenants and ratios as required by the terms of the agreement on a fiscal quarter basis 
we had uncommitted lines of credit available from certain banks totaling million as of december  any borrowings under these lines would be at prevailing money market rates 
further  we had an uncommitted letter of credit facility of million to support inventory purchases 
these arrangements may be terminated at any time at the option of the banks or the company 

table of contents as of december  and  we had no borrowings outstanding under any of our credit facilities 
the amount of peak borrowing under our facilities in was approximately million  and occurred during the fourth quarter of to fund our seasonal working capital requirements 
in  we expect to utilize our facilities in a similar fashion to  primarily to fund seasonal working capital requirements in the latter half of the year 
management believes that our operating costs  capital requirements and funding for our share repurchase program for will be funded through our current cash balances  our existing credit facilities which place certain limitations on additional debt  stock repurchases  acquisitions and on the amount of dividends we may pay  and also contain certain other financial and operating covenants and cash from operations  without the need for additional financing 
however  as discussed in part i  item a  risk factors  of this annual report on form k  several risks and uncertainties could require that the company raise additional capital through equity and or debt financing 
from time to time  the company considers acquisition opportunities which  if pursued  could also result in the need for additional financing 
however  if the need arises  our ability to obtain any additional credit facilities will depend upon prevailing market conditions  our financial condition and the terms and conditions of such additional facilities 
the continued volatility in the credit markets could result in significant increases in borrowing costs for any new debt we may require 
aggregate contractual obligations at december   we have the following contractual obligations due by period less than more than total year years years years dollars in millions operating leases purchase obligations deferred compensation plan total see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
purchase obligations consist of open production purchase orders for sourced footwear  apparel and accessories and materials used to manufacture footwear and open purchase orders for operating expense purchases relating to goods or services ordered in the normal course of business 
our deferred compensation plan liability was million at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
we had million of gross liability for uncertain tax positions recorded in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at december  we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
off balance sheet arrangements letters of credit as of december   and  we had letters of credit outstanding of million  million and million respectively 
these letters of credit were issued predominantly for the purchase of inventory 
the decrease in letters of credit outstanding in was driven by reduced purchases resulting from lower sales 
we use funds from operations and unsecured committed and uncommitted lines of credit as the primary sources of financing for our seasonal and other working capital requirements 
our principal risks to these sources of financing are the impact on our financial condition from economic downturns  a decrease in the demand for our products  increases in the prices of materials and a variety of other factors

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements on borrowings and investments and currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and cash flows 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices that should mitigate a portion of the adverse effect of these and other potential exposures 
we utilize cash from operations and us dollar denominated borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs 
short term debt  if required  is used to meet working capital requirements and long term debt  if required  is generally used to finance long term investments 
in addition  we use derivative instruments to manage the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on a portion of our foreign currency transactions 
these derivative instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
cash balances are invested in high grade securities with terms less than three months 
we have available unsecured committed and uncommitted lines of credit as sources of financing for our working capital requirements 
borrowings under these credit agreements bear interest at variable rates based on either lenders cost of funds  plus an applicable spread  or prevailing money market rates 
as of december   and  we had no short term or long term debt outstanding 
our foreign currency exposure is generated primarily from our european operating subsidiaries and  to a lesser degree  our asian and canadian operating subsidiaries 
we seek to mitigate the impact of these foreign currency fluctuations through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments  primarily foreign currency forward contracts 
these derivative instruments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet 
the company has implemented a program that qualifies for hedge accounting treatment to aid in mitigating our foreign currency exposures and decrease the volatility of our earnings 
we began hedging the company s foreign currency exposure under this new hedging program in the third quarter of the foreign currency forward contracts under this program will expire in months or less 
based upon sensitivity analysis as of december   a change in foreign exchange rates would cause the fair value of our financial instruments to increase decrease by approximately million  compared with an increase decrease of million as of december  the decrease as of december   compared to december   is primarily related to a reduction in our foreign currency denominated exposures as of december  compared with december
