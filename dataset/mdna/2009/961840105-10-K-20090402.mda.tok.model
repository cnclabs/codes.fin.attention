table of contents business segments we operate two nationwide  primarily mall based  chains of retail stores under the names wet seal and arden b 
although the two operating segments are similar in their products  production processes  distribution methods  and regulatory environment  they are distinct in their economic characteristics 
as a result  we consider these segments to be two distinct reportable segments 
wet seal 
wet seal is a junior apparel brand for teenage girls that seek trend focused and value competitive clothing  with a target customer age of to years old 
wet seal seeks to provide its customer base with a balance of affordably priced  fashionable and basic apparel and accessories 
arden b 
arden b is a fashion brand for the feminine contemporary woman with sex appeal 
arden b targets customers aged to years old and seeks to deliver contemporary collections of fashion and basic separates and accessories for various aspects of the customers lifestyles 
we maintain a web based store located at www 
wetseal 
com  offering wet seal merchandise comparable to that carried in our stores to customers over the internet 
we also maintain a web based store located at www 
ardenb 
com  offering arden b apparel and accessories comparable to those carried in our stores to customers over the internet 
our online stores are designed to serve as an extension of the in store experience and offer a wide selection of merchandise  which helps expand in store sales 
internet operations for both wet seal and arden b are included in their respective operating segments 
in fiscal   and  we experienced rapid growth in both visitor traffic and our online sales  and we will continue to develop our wet seal and arden b websites to increase their effectiveness in marketing our brands 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding segment reporting  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
our stores wet seal stores average approximately  square feet in size and in fiscal had average sales per square foot of as of january   we operated wet seal stores 
arden b stores average approximately  square feet in size and in fiscal had average sales per square foot of as of january   we operated arden b stores 
during fiscal  we opened and closed four wet seal stores and opened four and closed four arden b stores 
during fiscal  we opened and closed wet seal stores and opened seven and closed four arden b stores 
in late fiscal  we scaled back plans to open new stores to concentrate our efforts on managing our core businesses 
during fiscal  we opened and closed three wet seal stores and closed eight arden b stores 
we believe future closures for at least the next months following the date of this annual report will primarily result from lease expirations where we decide not to extend  or are unable to extend  a store lease 
we may  however  accelerate the closure of underperforming arden b stores prior to their lease expirations in cases where we can obtain favorable early lease terminations with the landlords or may rebrand a limited number of underperforming arden b stores as wet seal stores 
we expect our store count to remain relatively flat in fiscal to allow time to build our backlog of store opening opportunities and focus on managing our existing store base through a challenging retail environment that we expect will persist through at least the end of fiscal we have approximately existing store leases scheduled to expire in fiscal we expect to negotiate new leases that will allow us to remain in a substantial majority of these locations 
our ability to increase the number of wet seal and arden b stores in the future will depend  in part  on satisfactory cash flows from existing operations  the demand for our merchandise  our ability to 
table of contents find suitable mall or other locations with acceptable sites  and satisfactory terms and general business conditions 
our management does not believe there are significant geographic constraints on the locations of future stores 
competitive strengths experienced management team is in place 
although we have recently had changes among our senior management team  the current members of our senior management have extensive knowledge of our business and operations which will be instrumental in managing our company through the current difficult economic environment and driving our company into the next phase of its growth cycle 
mr 
edmond s 
thomas  our president and chief executive officer since october  formerly served as the president and chief operating officer of our company from to our chief financial officer  mr 
steven h 
benrubi  served as our controller for over two years prior to his appointment as chief financial officer in september ms 
maria comfort  our new president and chief merchandise officer for our wet seal division  who most recently served as chief merchandise officer of the hot topic division of hot topic  inc  has held a broad range of leadership roles during her merchandising career spanning more than years 
ms 
sharon hughes  the consultant that we hired to lead the arden b merchandising efforts on an interim basis  was an employee of our company from through  during which period ms 
hughes was involved in the formation of the arden b division and held several different merchant roles  including senior vice president of merchandising 
merchandising model at wet seal is focused on fast fashion at affordable prices 
at wet seal  we have developed considerable expertise in identifying  stocking  and selling a broad assortment of fresh  fashionable apparel and accessories at competitive prices 
our buyers work closely with senior management to determine the optimal product selection and promotion and pricing strategies 
a significant portion of our merchandise is sourced domestically 
this sourcing strategy enables us to ship new merchandise to the stores with high frequency and react quickly to changing fashion trends 
we also take regular markdowns to effect the rapid sale of slow moving inventory 
improved financial condition 
since the completion of a recapitalization of our company in may  our financial condition has improved significantly 
from fiscal through  we experienced positive comparable store sales growth  on a consolidated basis  in eight out of fiscal quarters and generated positive cash flows from operations in each of those fiscal years 
during fiscal  due in part to an extremely challenging economic environment  we experienced a comparable store sales decline on a consolidated basis 
however  in spite of this decline  as a result of our taking actions to reduce costs and more conservatively manage inventories  we experienced continued growth in our cash flows from operations 
in recent years  we have increased our cash position and substantially reduced our outstanding indebtedness 
through fiscal  million in principal amount of our convertible notes had been converted into shares of our class a common stock 
we used the proceeds from a may financing transaction to repay a bridge loan that we received from investors in january as part of the recapitalization of our company 
in addition  in march  we repaid the million outstanding balance of a junior secured term loan under our then existing credit facility 
also  in fiscal and  we repurchased million shares and million shares of our class a common stock for million and million  respectively 
we repurchased no common stock during fiscal as of january   our cash and cash equivalents were million  total debt  net of discount  was million  and stockholders equity was million 
strategy as part of a strategic review of business operations  we have identified what we believe are significant opportunities to improve our business trends and drive sales improvement 
the key elements of our opportunities are to manage business conservatively in the near term through the difficult economic environment 
we have taken many actions to ensure we remain financially strong through a difficult economic environment over 
table of contents the near term and to position ourselves to capitalize on the company s growth and operating leverage opportunities when such environment improves 
in anticipation of a prolonged difficult retail environment  our near term goals include preserving a strong balance sheet  exercising prudence in our capital expenditure investments  maintaining clean inventory levels and reducing costs opportunistically 
as part of our cost cutting initiatives  in january and january  we eliminated and positions  respectively  in our corporate offices  and two and four positions  respectively  in our field operations  across numerous functional areas 
we ended fiscal with an improved balance sheet  a substantial cash position and nominal debt 
to continue to maintain our strong cash position  we will remain cautious with our capital expenditure investments 
we plan to maintain a relatively flat store count in fiscal as we continue to monitor the retail and leasing environment 
additionally  we will utilize significantly improved inventory management processes that were implemented in fiscal  and plan to maintain conservative inventory positions during fiscal lastly  we will continue to operate with a much more cost efficient  streamlined management organization by continuing to reduce excess costs across all areas of our business 
improve merchandise margin 
in our wet seal division  we have identified opportunities to improve our planning and allocation function  merchandise mix  and markdown cadence 
during fiscal  we will enhance merchandising profiles of each wet seal store and further integrate them into our planning and allocation function 
we plan to improve our markdown cadence and size offerings through implementation of markdown and size optimization systems  increase our focus on key merchandise item categories  continue to develop branded and private label assortments  and expand our bottoms offerings in the merchandise mix 
in our arden b division  we have identified opportunities to improve inventory management  merchandise mix and sourcing  and to reduce overall price points and modify promotional strategies across all product categories 
we plan to better align our merchandise mix with customer needs by improving the balance of wear to work  everyday and occasion apparel  and adding fashion basics across key categories 
additionally  we will refine our sourcing process and employ more consistent pricing practices and improved promotional disciplines 
improve store operations 
our store operation opportunities include better utilization of customer feedback  simplification and or elimination of nonselling activities  and improved performance in underperforming stores 
we will continue to evaluate store tasks to determine if excess tasks can be eliminated to facilitate greater focus on sales  and we plan to employ more detailed analysis and monitoring of the operating results of underperforming stores 
improve real estate 
we will continue to seek to improve our new and remodeled store economics and address pressure from rising occupancy and store construction costs 
we will utilize a new store prototype and enhanced fixturing developed in fiscal to take advantage of a more attractive store design and enhance ease of merchandising to produce a more shopper friendly environment 
additionally  we will continue to test off mall locations by opening a small number of stores in regional power centers during fiscal we plan to rebuild the pipeline for store growth and maintain a conservative near term capital expenditure investment plan  which we estimate will result in fiscal store openings of approximately wet seal stores and no arden b stores 
additionally  we plan to remodel or relocate approximately stores during fiscal as a result of lease renewal 
improve marketing 
we believe we have the opportunity to improve our marketing planning and our divisional merchandising strategies 
we are developing specific plans for each division for fiscal we intend to place emphasis on visual merchandising  celebrity related promotions  and direct and grass roots marketing 
additionally  we will build marketing strategies based on past successes of our frequent buyer and loyalty programs  and we will continue to utilize internet marketing to drive sales and increase store traffic 
improve information systems 
in addition to markdown and size optimization systems  we will implement a new point of sale system in all stores during fiscal  which will improve system reliability and increase store operational efficiency when processing promotional transactions 
we will also begin implementation 
table of contents activities for an updated retail merchandising system to be completed in fiscal  which will improve merchandising decision support and increase efficiency of inventory management practices 
additionally  we will update short term and long term information systems strategies and install improved project management and cost controls 
improve physical distribution and transport 
we will reconfigure and automate our existing distribution center  which will produce increased efficiencies and lead to cost savings 
preliminarily  we intend to begin this project in late fiscal  but the project may be subject to delay depending upon the status of other capital expenditure priorities 
resume our positive comparable store sales trend 
from fiscal through fiscal  we experienced seven out of eight quarters of positive comparable store sales results  on a consolidated basis 
this resulted primarily from increased transaction counts and the number of items purchased per customer  partially offset by a decrease in average retail price per item sold due to a transition of the wet seal business to a fast fashion merchandising model and an accompanying change in pricing strategy 
after positive comparable store sales results in the first quarter of fiscal  we experienced three consecutive quarters of comparable store sales declines  on a consolidated basis  in the low single digits 
as a result  consolidated comparable store sales for fiscal declined  with the comparable sales at the wet seal stores increasing and at the arden b stores declining 
in fiscal  as a result of an extremely challenging economic environment and continued deterioration of the arden b business  we experienced an decrease in comparable store sales  with the comparable sales at the wet seal stores declining and at the arden b stores declining

in fiscal  the zutopia concept was designated as a discontinued operation  which had no significant impact on comparable store sales 

table of contents in fiscal  we plan to improve comparable store sales with the implementation of strategic initiatives noted above  which  among other things  includes better alignment of our merchandise mix with customer needs  increased efficiencies in our planning and allocation functions  improvements to the pricing and promotional strategies in our arden b business  and implementation of enhanced merchandising and point of sale systems 
revive arden b 
in february  we engaged ms 
sharon hughes as a consultant to serve as the chief merchandise officer for arden b under the direction and supervision of mr 
thomas 
since their arrival  we have significantly reduced the size and cost of the arden b merchandising organization 
as a result  we have reduced in house design activities and refined the product development and sourcing processes to include more partnering with merchandise suppliers 
nonetheless  arden b continues to underperform  having incurred consecutive months of comparable store sales declines through february we believe our primary opportunity for the arden b division is in the adjustment of our merchandise mix and our pricing and promotional strategies 
we have adjusted our assortments at arden b to include more fashion basic merchandise 
additionally  we have implemented new pricing and promotional strategies at arden b  which include significant reductions in price points across all categories 
we believe arden b has yet to achieve its full potential with its target young contemporary customers 
we aim to drive sales and profitability at arden b through distinctive  quality merchandise  unified apparel and accessory assortments  the new value pricing strategy  and an improved in store customer experience 
we may also accelerate the closure of underperforming arden b stores prior to their lease expirations in cases where we can obtain favorable early lease terminations with the landlords or may rebrand a limited number of arden b stores as wet seal stores 
expand our online business 
we plan to continue to grow our internet business through several initiatives  including a focus on integrated branding and targeted marketing programs utilizing our customer database and customer loyalty programs 
although our internet sales are modest compared to consolidated net sales  we are experiencing substantial growth 
a combination of several changes contributed to the improvement  including hiring staffs with internet marketing experience  making processes scalable  aligning the online sites with the look of the physical stores  and implementing appropriate targeted marketing 
we are optimizing inventory allocated to the internet business to better meet the demand of our internet customers and have strengthened our buying and planning staff fully to meet the anticipated sales growth in this area 
we plan to continue to grow our internet business through continued improvements to inventory planning  fulfillment  and customer service 
the growth in our website traffic continues to be substantial and the internet is a key component for driving store traffic 
prior to the holiday season  we launched new website platforms for both divisions 
the new websites support advanced merchandising capabilities  personalization based on browsing behavior and past purchase history  and testing tools to measure and determine the most effective content and promotion strategies 
design  buying  and product development our design and buying teams are responsible for identifying evolving fashion trends and developing themes to guide our merchandising strategy 
each retail division has a separate buying team 
the merchandising teams for each retail division develop fashion themes and strategies by assessing customer responses to current trends  shopping international and appropriate domestic markets  using fashion services  and gathering references from industry publications 
after selecting fashion themes  the design and buying teams work closely with vendors to use colors  materials  and designs that create images consistent with the themes for our product offerings 
since fiscal for our wet seal division  and beginning in fiscal for our arden b division  we have decreased our dependency on internally designed merchandise 
this allows us more flexibility to respond to the changing fashion trends of our target customers  to buy in smaller lots  and to reduce product development lead times 
see also allocation and distribution below 
marketing  advertising  and promotion we believe that our brands are among our most important assets 
our ability to successfully increase brand awareness is dependent upon our ability to address the changing needs and priorities of each brand s target 
table of contents customers 
to that end  we will place emphasis on visual merchandising  celebrity related promotions  and direct and grass roots marketing 
additionally  we will build marketing strategies based on past successes of our frequent buyer and loyalty programs 
we will also heighten our focus on customer acquisition and increase our use of internet marketing to drive increased store traffic 
during fiscal   and  we spent   and  respectively  of net sales on advertising 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to the elimination of print advertising programs and the decision not to execute certain advertising activities at our arden b division until merchandise content improves 
in fiscal  our primary marketing focus was on in store promotion programs for the wet seal stores and direct marketing for the arden b stores  which included mailings of various catalogs and postcards throughout the year 
as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this annual report  we offer a frequent buyer program in our wet seal stores in order to build loyalty to the brand  increase the frequency of visits  promote multiple item purchases  and gain direct access to the customer 
as part of this program  we send e mails to participants to notify them of special in store promotions 
our arden b division also offers a loyalty program  b rewarded  designed for the same purposes as that of our wet seal division 
sourcing and vendor relationships we purchase our merchandise from both domestic and foreign vendors 
for fiscal  approximately of our retail merchandising receipts were directly imported from foreign vendors 
although in fiscal no single vendor provided more than of our merchandise  management believes we are one of the largest customers of many of our smaller vendors 
quality control is monitored at the distribution points of our largest vendors and manufacturers  and merchandise is inspected upon arrival at our foothill ranch  california  facility 
we do not maintain any long term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase merchandise from any single supplier  and there are many vendors who could supply our merchandise 
allocation and distribution our merchandising effort primarily focuses on maintaining a regular flow of fresh  fashionable merchandise into our stores 
successful execution depends in large part on our integrated planning  allocation  and distribution functions 
by working closely with store operations management and merchandise buyers  our teams of planners and allocators manage inventory levels and coordinate the allocation of merchandise to each of our stores based on sales volume and store size  demographics  climate  and other factors that may influence an individual store s product mix 
during fiscal  we implemented merchandise planning software that assists us in streamlining the planning process 
all merchandise for retail stores is received from vendors at our foothill ranch  california  distribution center  where items are inspected and prepared for shipping to our stores 
we ship all of our merchandise to our stores by common carrier 
consistent with our goal of maintaining the freshness of our product offerings  we frequently ship new merchandise to stores  and markdowns are taken regularly to effect the rapid sale of slow moving inventory 
marked down merchandise that remains unsold is either sent to clearance centers for deep discounting and rapid movement  sold to an outside clearance company  or given to charity 
the fulfillment process and distribution of merchandise for our online business is performed at our foothill ranch  california  distribution center 
information and control systems our merchandise  financial  and store computer systems are integrated and operate using primarily oracle technology 
we have invested in a large data warehouse that provides management  buyers  and planners 
table of contents comprehensive data that helps us identify emerging trends and manage inventories 
the core merchandise system is provided by a leading retail enterprise resource planning  or erp  software provider  and is frequently enhanced to support strategic business initiatives 
all of our stores have a point of sale system operating on software provided by a leading provider of specialty retailing point of sale systems 
this system facilitates bar coded ticket scanning  automatic price lookups  and centralized credit authorizations 
all stores are networked to the corporate office via a centrally managed virtual private network 
we utilize a store portal that is integrated with the corporate merchandise erp system to provide the stores and corporate staff with current information regarding sales  promotions  inventory  and shipments  and enables more efficient communications with the corporate office 
in fiscal  we installed new wide area networking hardware at all stores which incorporate security upgrades to guard against security breaches to our stores point of sale system  completed our merchandise allocation system  upgraded our financial system  and launched new website platforms for the online businesses 
in fiscal  in order to further enhance store efficiency and improve gross margin through the use of technology  we acquired and began implementation activities for oracle retail price optimization and oracle retail point of sale  which will be fully implemented in fiscal  and oracle retail merchandising  which will be fully implemented in fiscal additionally  in fiscal  we implemented a new time and attendance labor system 
in fiscal  we also intend to acquire and implement a size optimization system to support merchandise allocation by item sizes in our wet seal stores 
seasonality and inflation our business is seasonal in nature  with the christmas season  beginning the week of thanksgiving and ending the first saturday after christmas  and the back to school season  beginning the last week of july and ending during september  historically accounting for a large percentage of our sales volume 
for the past three fiscal years  the christmas and back to school seasons together accounted for an average of slightly less than of our annual sales 
our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on the sales generated during these peak periods 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the past three years 
however  we cannot be certain that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
any decrease in sales or margins during these periods  whether as a result of economic conditions  poor weather  or other factors  could have a material adverse effect on our company 
trademarks our primary trademarks and service marks are wet seal and arden b  which are registered in the united states patent and trademark office 
we also have registered  or have applications pending for  a number of other trademarks including  but not limited to  accomplice  b

in general  the registrations for these trademarks and service marks are renewable indefinitely as long as the marks are used as required under applicable regulations 
we are not aware of any adverse claims or infringement actions relating to our trademarks or service marks 
competition the women s retail apparel industry is highly competitive  with fashion  quality  price  location  and service being the principal competitive factors 
our wet seal and arden b stores compete with specialty apparel retailers  department stores  and certain other apparel retailers  including aeropostale  anthropologie  abercrombie fitch  charlotte russe  gap  banana republic  h m  old navy  pacific sunwear  american eagle  target  urban outfitters  forever  express  jc penney  nordstrom  bebe  zara  guess  bcbg  and other regional retailers 
many of our competitors are large national chains that have substantially greater financial  marketing  and other resources than we do 
while we believe we compete effectively for favorable site locations and lease terms  competition for prime locations within malls is intense  and we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain new locations on terms favorable to us  if at all 

table of contents customers our company s business is not dependent upon a single customer or small group of customers 
environmental matters we are not aware of any federal  state  or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position  or result in material capital expenditures 
however  we cannot predict the effect on our operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations 
during fiscal  there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated for fiscal government regulation our company is subject to various federal  state  and local laws affecting our business 
each of our company s stores must comply with licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which the store is located 
to date  our company has not been significantly affected by any difficulty  delay  or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals 
our company is also subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as employment and pay practices  overtime  and working conditions 
the bulk of our company s employees are paid on an hourly basis at rates related to the federal and state minimum wages 
in the past  we have been assessed penalties or paid settlements to gain dismissal of lawsuits for noncompliance with certain of these laws  and future noncompliance could result in a material adverse effect on our company s operations 
in july  may  september  and march  we were served with class action complaints alleging violations under certain state of california labor laws 
in november  we reached an agreement to settle the july class action complaint for approximately million  and as of february   we had accrued within accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet an amount equal to this settlement amount 
we have continued to retain this accrued amount within accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of january  in february  the court issued its order granting final approval of the class action settlement  subject to appeal 
on april   a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed 
we anticipate receiving the appellate decision by june we are vigorously defending the may  september  and march complaints and are unable to predict the likely outcome and whether such outcome may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
accordingly  no provisions for loss contingencies for the may  september  and march complaints have been accrued as of january  our company is also subject to the fair credit reporting act the fcra under federal law  as well as to state laws with similar requirements  with respect to the protection of our customers credit and debit card and other personal data 
the fcra provides in part that expiration dates may not be printed together with certain parts of the customer s account number on credit or debit card receipts given to customers 
the fcra imposes significant penalties upon violators of these rules and regulations if the lack of compliance is deemed to have been willful 
otherwise  damages are limited to actual losses incurred 
in january and february  we were served with two class action complaints alleging violations of the act 
the plaintiffs in the february complaint dismissed the complaint with prejudice in august on december   we reached a tentative agreement to settle the january complaint for less than million 
however  prior to the receipt of the executed settlement agreement  on february   we were named in another action  alleging the same violation  in the us district court  western district of pennsylvania 
as a result  we withdrew our offer to settle the january action noted above 
on june   the credit and debit card receipt clarification act of was enacted 
this measure amended the fcra to declare that a company that printed an expiration date on any receipt provided to a consumer cardholder at the point of sale or transaction between december   and the enactment of this legislation  but otherwise complied with fcra requirements for such receipt  shall not be in willful noncompliance by reason of printing such expiration date on it 
on july   and july   
table of contents dismissals were filed by the plaintiffs in the united states district court central district of california and the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania  respectively 
we made nominal settlement payments for both claims and all parties agreed that the actions were dismissed with prejudice and that each party was to bear all of its own costs and attorney s fees 
we continue to monitor our facilities for compliance with the americans with disabilities act  or the ada  in order to conform to its requirements 
under the ada  we could be required to expend funds to modify stores to better provide service to  or make reasonable accommodation for the employment of  disabled persons 
we believe that expenditures  if required  would not have a material adverse effect on our company s operations 
employees as of january   our operations had  employees  consisting of  full time employees and  part time employees 
full time personnel consisted of salaried employees and  hourly employees 
all part time personnel are hourly employees 
of all employees   were sales personnel and were administrative and distribution center personnel 
personnel at all levels of store operations are provided various opportunities for cash and or other incentives based upon various individual store sales targets 
all of our employees are nonunion  and  in management s opinion  are paid competitively at current industry standards 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
item a 
risk factors risks related to our business the recent changes in general economic conditions  and the impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending  have adversely impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so 
recently  consumer confidence and consumer spending have deteriorated significantly and could remain depressed for an extended period 
our performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending  and we believe our decline in comparable store sales in fiscal was at least due in part to these economic conditions 
consumer purchases of discretionary items  including our merchandise  generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty 
as a result of this general economic slowdown  we may face new risks that will impact many facets of our operations  including  among other things  the ability of one or more of our vendors to deliver their merchandise in a timely manner or otherwise meet their obligations to us 
if the conditions in the us and world economic markets remain uncertain or continue to be volatile  or if they deteriorate further  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be adversely affected 
the financial performance of our arden b division has been poor over the past two years  and our ability to improve the financial performance of this division may not be successful 
we have experienced prolonged deterioration in the financial performance of our arden b division over the past two years 
although we have engaged ms 
sharon hughes as a consultant to serve as the chief merchandise officer for our arden b division and to focus on providing fashion appropriate merchandise to arden b s target customer in an attractive shopping environment  our comparable store sales continued to worsen during fiscal amid the economic slowdown and such trend may continue in fiscal our board of directors and senior management team are continually reviewing the financial performance and turnaround efforts involving our arden b division 
in fiscal  we closed eight arden b stores and we may close more arden b stores in fiscal  or rebrand some underperforming arden b stores as wet seal stores 
there is no assurance that our rebranding efforts will be successful or such rebranded wet seal stores will no longer suffer continuing financial losses 
we have incurred and may continue to incur impairment charges in connection with the closing of arden b stores  which is a noncash event that would negatively impact our 
table of contents earnings and earnings per share 
if we decide to close any stores before the expiration of the lease term  we may incur payments to landlords to terminate or buy out the remaining term of the lease 
we also may incur employee termination and inventory liquidation costs at such stores 
these costs would negatively impact our financial results and cash position 
recently  we have had significant changes in our senior management and these changes may impact our ability to execute our business strategy in the near term 
in february  our chief operating officer and our president of arden b merchandise resigned 
mr 
edmond s 
thomas  our president and chief executive officer  and mr 
steven h 
benrubi  our executive vice president and chief financial officer  and others within management assumed the duties of our former chief operating officer  while ms 
sharon hughes serves as chief merchandise officer of arden b under the direct supervision of mr 
thomas 
in may  our chief merchandise officer of the wet seal division  ms 
dyan m 
jozwick  resigned and in july  we appointed ms 
maria comfort as the president and chief merchandise officer of our wet seal division 
in addition  in fiscal and fiscal  we reduced our workforce in reaction to and in anticipation of a prolonged economic slowdown and shrinking consumer spending 
we anticipate that we will experience a transition period before our new key employees are fully integrated in their new roles 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our remaining workforce is sufficient  or individually or collectively has the experience needed to carry out our future operations 
any of the above factors could impact our ability to address the business challenges that confront our company 
we do not expect to significantly increase our net store count in the near term and this decision may have a negative impact on our financial condition  results of operations  and or cash flows 
due to difficult economic conditions  a need to rebuild our pipeline of potential real estate opportunities  and the weak performance of our arden b division  we expect to close a limited number of arden b stores and do not anticipate opening any new arden b stores in fiscal we also expect to open a limited number of new wet seal stores  net of closures  during the same period 
we have redirected our focus to improving the financial performance of our existing stores and finding the correct mix of merchandise for our customers 
to the extent we are unable to improve the sales and profitability and reduce the selling expenses of our existing stores  our financial position  results of operations  and or cash flows may suffer 
our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation 
in general  section of the internal revenue code  or section  contains provisions that may limit the availability of federal net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  to be used to offset taxable income in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interests 
under section  potential limitations on nols are triggered when there has been an ownership change generally defined as a greater than change by value in our stock ownership over a three year period 
our ownership changes on april   and december   resulted in section limitations applying to nols generated prior to those dates  which were approximately million 
as a result of these ownership changes  of our million nols as of january   we may utilize up to million of our nols to offset taxable income in fiscal future transactions involving the sale or other transfer of our stock may result in additional ownership changes for purposes of section the occurrence of such additional ownership changes could limit our ability to utilize our remaining nols and possibly other tax attributes 
limitations imposed on our ability to use nols and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income could cause us to pay us federal income taxes earlier than we otherwise would if such limitations were not in effect 
any further ownership change also could cause such nols and other tax attributes to expire unused  thereby reducing or eliminating the benefit of such nols and other tax attributes to us and adversely affecting our future cash flows 

table of contents we may not be successful in achieving improvements in the business and operations of our company that have been identified by our president and chief executive officer 
since his appointment in october  mr 
thomas has identified several areas in which our company s business and operations can be improved 
mr 
thomas has focused on seeking to increase comparable store sales for our retail divisions  improving our company s gross margin  enhancing in store productivity  reviving the arden b business  and expanding our online business 
although mr 
thomas is highly qualified and has extensive experience in the retail industry  including with our company  in light of the economic slowdown and continued decrease in consumer confidence and discretionary spending  we may not be able to implement our strategy in the desired time frame and or achieve the intended results and level of improvement desired by our senior management team and board of directors 
if we are unable to anticipate and react to new fashion trends  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we rely on a limited demographic customer base for a large percentage of our sales 
our brand image is dependent upon our ability to anticipate  identify  and provide fresh inventory reflecting current fashion trends 
if we fail to anticipate  identify  or react appropriately or in a timely manner to these fashion trends  we could experience reduced consumer acceptance of our products  a diminished brand image  and higher markdowns 
these factors could result in lower selling prices and sales volumes for our products  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our company s ability to attract customers to its stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping centers in which many of our stores are located 
substantially  all of our stores are located in shopping centers 
factors beyond our control impact shopping center traffic  such as general economic conditions and consumer spending levels 
accordingly  the slowdown in the us economy has negatively affected consumer spending and reduced shopping center traffic 
as a result  mall operators have been facing increasing operational and financial difficulties 
the increasing inability of mall anchor tenants and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic around our stores  the increasing inability of mall operators to attract anchor tenants and maintain viable operations  and the increasing departures of existing anchor and other mall tenants due to declines in the sales volume and in the popularity of malls as shopping destinations  have reduced and will continue to reduce our sales volume and  consequently  adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  and or cash flows 
we depend upon a single center for our corporate offices and distribution activities  and any significant disruption in the operation of this center could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations  and or cash flows 
our corporate offices and the distribution functions for all of our stores and internet business are handled from a single leased facility in foothill ranch  california 
in general  this area of california is subject to earthquakes and wildfires 
any significant interruption in the operation of this facility due to a natural disaster  arson  accident  system failure  or other unforeseen event could delay or impair our ability to distribute merchandise to our stores and  consequently  lead to a decrease in sales 
the financial losses incurred may exceed our insurance for earthquake damages and business interruption costs related to any such disruption 
as a result  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and or cash flows could be adversely affected 
furthermore  we have little experience operating essential functions away from our main corporate offices and are uncertain what effect operating satellite facilities might have on our business  personnel  and results of operations 
fluctuations in our results of operations for the third fiscal quarter and the fourth fiscal quarter have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition  results of operations  and or cash flows 
we experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating income  with a disproportionate amount of our revenues and a majority of our income being generated in the third fiscal quarter back to school season  
table of contents which begins the last week of july and ends during september  and the fourth fiscal quarter holiday season 
our revenues and income are generally lower during the first and second fiscal quarters 
in addition  any factors that harm our third and fourth fiscal quarter operating results  including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year 
in order to prepare for our peak shopping seasons  we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry at other times of the year 
an unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during our peak shopping seasons could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown  which could reduce our net sales and gross profit 
alternatively  an unanticipated increase in demand for certain of our products could leave us unable to fulfill customer demand and result in lost sales and customer dissatisfaction 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors  including the merchandise mix and the timing and level of inventory markdowns 
as a result  historical period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily indicative of future period to period results 
you should not rely on the results of a single fiscal quarter  particularly the third fiscal quarter back to school season or fourth fiscal quarter holiday season  as an indication of our annual results or our future performance 
our failure to effectively compete with other retailers for sales and locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and or cash flows 
the women s retail apparel industry is highly competitive  with fashion  quality  price  location  and service being the principal competitive factors 
our wet seal and arden b stores compete with specialty apparel retailers  department stores  and certain other apparel retailers  including aeropostale  anthropologie  abercrombie fitch  charlotte russe  gap  banana republic  h m  old navy  pacific sunwear  american eagle  target  urban outfitters  forever  express  jc penney  nordstrom  bebe  zara  guess  and bcbg 
many of our competitors are large national chains that have substantially greater financial  marketing  and other resources than we do 
we face a variety of competitive challenges  including anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands  maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to consumers in narrowly defined market segments  developing innovative  high quality products in sizes  colors  and styles that appeal to consumers in our target markets and maintaining a sufficient quantity of these items for which there is the greatest demand  obtaining favorable site locations within malls on reasonable terms  sourcing merchandise efficiently  and pricing our products competitively and achieving customer perception of value 
our industry has low barriers to entry that allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace 
any of these factors could result in reductions in sales or the prices of our products which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and or cash flows 
furthermore  competition for prime locations and lease terms within shopping malls  in particular  is intense  and we may not be able to obtain new locations or maintain our existing locations on terms favorable to us 
the upcoming expiration of leases for approximately of our existing stores could lead to increased costs associated with renegotiating our leases and or relocating our stores 
we have approximately existing store leases scheduled to expire in fiscal in connection with the expiration of these leases  we will have to renegotiate new leases which could result in higher rental amounts for 
table of contents each store and landlord requirements to remodel existing locations as a condition for renewal 
although we expect to negotiate new leases with acceptable terms that will allow us to remain in a substantial majority of these locations  we may not be able to obtain new terms that are favorable to us 
in addition  as a result of renewal negotiations  we may be required by the landlord to remodel  which could result in significant capital expenditures 
in addition  some landlords may refuse to renew our leases due to our lower sales per square foot as compared with other prospective tenants 
if we are unable to agree to new terms with our landlords  we will have to close or relocate these stores  which could result in a significant expenditure and could lead to an interruption in the operation of our business at the affected stores  and we could be required to relocate to less desirable locations or may not be able to find viable locations at all 
because of the importance of our brand names  we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
we have registered trademarks for wet seal and arden b which are registered in the retail store services and other classes 
we take actions to establish and protect our intellectual property 
however  others may infringe on our intellectual property rights or seek to block the sale of our products as violative of their intellectual property rights 
if we are required to stop using any of our registered or nonregistered trademarks  our sales could decline and  consequently  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
covenants contained in agreements governing our existing indebtedness restrict the manner in which we conduct our business  and our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  growth prospects  and ability to procure merchandise for our stores 
our senior revolving credit facility and the indenture  as amended  governing our secured convertible notes contain covenants that restrict the manner in which we conduct our business 
subject to certain exceptions including an exception to permit limited stock repurchases  these covenants restrict our ability to  among other things incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness  make investments or acquisitions  merge  consolidate  dissolve  or liquidate  engage in certain asset sales including the sale of stock  repurchase stock  grant liens on assets  pay dividends  and close stores 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing our existing indebtedness  acceleration of any amounts then outstanding  the foreclosure upon collateral securing the debt obligations  or the unavailability of the lines of credit 
we do not authenticate the license rights of our suppliers 
we purchase merchandise from a number of vendors who purport to hold manufacturing and distribution rights under the terms of license agreements or that assert that their products are not subject to any restrictions as to distribution 
we generally rely upon each vendor s representation concerning those manufacturing and distribution rights and do not independently verify whether each vendor legally holds adequate rights to the 
table of contents licensed properties they are manufacturing or distributing 
if we acquire unlicensed merchandise or merchandise violating a registered trademark  we could be obligated to remove it from our stores  incur costs associated with destruction of the merchandise if the vendor is unwilling or unable to reimburse us  and be subject to civil and criminal liability 
the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  and or cash flows 
we are subject to risks associated with our procurement of products from non us based vendors and us vendors that purchase products internationally  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and or cash flows 
a portion of our products is manufactured outside the us as a result  we are susceptible to greater losses as a result of a number of risks inherent in doing business in international markets and from a number of factors beyond our control  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and or cash flows 
these factors include import or trade restrictions including increased tariffs  customs duties  taxes  or quotas imposed by the us government in respect of the foreign countries in which our products are currently manufactured or any of the countries in which our products may be manufactured in the future  political instability or acts of terrorism  significant fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  restrictions on the transfer of funds between the united states and foreign jurisdictions and or potential disruption of imports due to labor disputes at us ports  any of which could adversely affect our merchandise flow and  consequently  cause our sales to decline  and local business practices that do not conform to our legal or ethical guidelines 
the us and the countries in which our products are produced or sold may also  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs  or other restrictions  or adversely adjust prevailing quota  duty  or tariff levels 
in addition  none of our international suppliers or international manufacturers supplies or manufactures our products exclusively 
as a result  we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers and import quota capacity 
if we were unable to obtain our raw materials and finished apparel from the countries where we wish to purchase them  either because room under the necessary quotas was unavailable or for any other reason  or if the cost of doing so should increase  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and or cash flows 
violation of labor laws and practices by our suppliers could harm our business and results of operations 
our company s policy is to use only those sourcing agents and independent manufacturers who operate in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
the violation of laws  particularly labor laws  by an independent manufacturer  or by one of the sourcing agents  or the divergence of an independent manufacturer s or sourcing agent s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the us or in the country in which the manufacturing facility is located  and the public revelation of those illegal or unethical practices  could cause significant damage to our company s reputation 
although our manufacturer operating guidelines promote ethical business practices  we do not control the business and operations of the manufacturers and cannot guarantee their legal and regulatory compliance 
we are exposed to business risks as a result of our internet operations 
we operate online stores at www 
wetseal 
com and www 
ardenb 
com 
our internet operations are subject to numerous risks  including unanticipated operating problems  reliance on third party computer hardware and software providers  system failures  and the need to invest in additional computer systems 
specific risks include i diversion of sales from our stores  ii rapid technological change  iii liability for online content  and 
table of contents iv risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate the website and its related support systems  including computer viruses  telecommunication failures  and electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
in addition  internet operations involve risks which are beyond our control that could have a direct material adverse effect on our operational results  including i price competition involving the items we intend to sell  ii the entry of our vendors into the internet business in direct competition with us  iii the level of merchandise returns experienced by us  iv governmental regulation  v online security breaches involving unauthorized access to our and or customer information  vi credit card fraud  and vii competition and general economic conditions specific to the internet  online commerce  and the apparel industry 
our inability to effectively address these risks and any other risks that we face in connection with our internet operations could adversely affect the profitability of our internet operations 
risks related to our common stock our stockholders may experience dilution due to conversions and exercises of outstanding convertible securities and or the antidilution protection of the securities 
since may  we have completed private placements of class a common stock and warrants  convertible notes  and shares of preferred stock that are convertible into or exercisable for shares of class a common stock 
through january   we have issued  shares of our class a common stock as a result of these private placements and exercises and conversions of these securities 
an additional  shares of class a common stock may be issued under the convertible notes  preferred stock  and warrants that remained outstanding as of january   and this number of shares of class a common stock is subject to antidilution adjustments based upon the antidilution provisions contained in these instruments 
the issuance of the additional shares of class a common stock upon conversion and exercise could cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline 
the price of our class a common stock has fluctuated significantly during the past few years and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
our class a common stock  which is traded on the nasdaq global market  has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
the market price of our class a common stock is likely to fluctuate  both because of actual and perceived changes in our operating results and prospects and because of general volatility in the stock market 
the market price of our class a common stock could continue to fluctuate widely in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations  including comparable store sales  the addition or loss of suppliers  customers  and other business relationships  changes in financial estimates of  and recommendations by  securities analysts  conditions or trends in the apparel and consumer products industries  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of our class a common stock  general market and economic conditions  and other events or factors  including the realization of any of the risks described in this risk factors section  many of which are beyond our control 
fluctuations in the price and trading volume of our class a common stock in response to factors such as those set forth above could be unrelated or disproportionate to our actual operating performance 

table of contents we have never paid dividends on our class a common stock and do not plan to do so in the future 
holders of shares of our class a common stock are entitled to receive any dividends that may be declared by our board of directors 
however  we have not paid any cash dividends on our class a common stock and we do not expect to for the foreseeable future 
also  our agreements with our senior lenders and the indenture governing our notes restrict the payment of dividends to our stockholders 
our charter provisions and delaware law may have anti takeover effects 
our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to designate and issue  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock with voting  conversion  and other rights and preferences that could differentially and adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our class a common stock  which could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
furthermore  certain provisions of delaware law applicable to our company could also delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer  or proxy contest involving our company  including section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless certain conditions are met 
the possible issuance of preferred stock and the application of anti takeover provisions of delaware law could each have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change in control of our company  including  without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest  making the acquisition of a substantial block of class a common stock more difficult and limiting the price that investors might in the future be willing to pay for shares of our class a common stock

executive overview we are a national specialty retailer operating stores selling fashionable and contemporary apparel and accessory items designed for female customers aged to years old 
we operate two nationwide  primarily mall based  chains of retail stores under the names wet seal and arden b 
at january   we had retail stores in states  puerto rico and washington dc of the stores  there were wet seal stores and arden b stores 
we report our results of operations as two reportable segments representing our two retail divisions wet seal and arden b 
internet operations for wet seal and arden b are included in their respective operating segments 
although the two operating segments are similar in their products  production processes  distribution methods and regulatory environment  in fiscal  due to the poor profit performance of the arden b division and the disparity in financial performance between the two segments  we concluded that we no longer considered these operating segments to be economically similar 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to the end of january 
fiscal and fiscal each include weeks of operations and fiscal includes weeks of operations 
we consider the following to be key performance indicators in evaluating our performance comparable store sales for purposes of measuring comparable store sales  sales include merchandise sales as well as membership fee revenues recognized under our wet seal division s frequent buyer program during the applicable period 
stores are deemed comparable stores on the first day of the month following the one year anniversary of their opening or significant remodel relocation  which we define to be a square footage increase or decrease of at least 
stores that are remodeled or relocated with a resulting square footage change of less than are maintained in the comparable store base with no interruption 
however  stores that are closed for four or more days in a fiscal month  due to remodel  relocation or other reasons  are removed from the comparable store base for that fiscal month as well as for the comparable fiscal month in the following fiscal year 
comparable store sales results are important in achieving operating leverage on certain expenses such as store payroll  occupancy  depreciation and amortization  general  and administrative expenses and other costs that are at least partially fixed 
positive comparable store sales results generate greater operating 
table of contents leverage on expenses while negative comparable store sales results negatively affect operating leverage 
comparable store sales results also have a direct impact on our total net sales  cash  and working capital 
average transaction counts we consider the trend in the average number of sales transactions occurring in our stores to be a key performance metric 
to the extent we are able to increase transaction counts in our stores that more than offset any decrease in the average dollar sale per transaction  we will generate increases in our comparable store sales 
gross margins we analyze the components of gross margin  specifically cumulative mark on  markups  markdowns  shrink  buying costs  distribution costs and store occupancy costs 
any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups  a significant increase in our use of markdowns or in inventory shrink  or an inability to generate sufficient sales leverage on other components of cost of sales could have an adverse impact on our gross margin results and results of operations 
operating income we view operating income as a key indicator of our financial success 
the key drivers of operating income are comparable store sales  gross margins and the changes we experience in operating costs 
cash flow and liquidity working capital we evaluate cash flow from operations  liquidity and working capital to determine our short term operational financing needs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  some of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with absolute certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
our accounting policies and estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the policies and estimates discussed below involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies that are material to our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we have certain accounting policies that require more significant management judgment and estimates than others 
these include our accounting policies with respect to revenue recognition  merchandise inventories  long lived assets  impairment of goodwill  stock based compensation  income taxes and insurance reserves 
revenue recognition sales are recognized upon purchases by customers at our retail store locations 
taxes collected from our customers are and have been recorded on a net basis 
for online sales  revenue is recognized at the estimated time goods are received by customers 
customers typically receive goods within four days of being shipped 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers for online sales are included in net sales 
for fiscal  and  shipping and handling fee revenues were million  million  and million  respectively 
we have recorded accruals to estimate sales returns by customers based on historical sales return results 
historically  a customer generally could return merchandise within days of the original purchase date 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we modified our sales return policy to allow customers to return merchandise only within days of original purchase 
we also modified sales return policy such that wet seal 
table of contents retail store merchandise may be returned for store credit only and arden b retail store and online merchandise may be returned for cash refund or store credit within seven days of the original purchase date  and for store credit only thereafter 
for wet seal online sales  merchandise may be returned within days for a full refund 
actual return rates have historically been within management s estimates and the accruals established 
as the accrual for merchandise returns is based on estimates  the actual returns could differ from the accrual  which could impact net sales 
the accrual for merchandise returns is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at january  and february   respectively 
we recognize the sales from gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits as they are redeemed for merchandise 
prior to redemption  we maintain an unearned revenue liability for gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits until we are released from such liability  which includes consideration of potential obligations arising from state escheatment laws 
our gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits do not have expiration dates  however  over time  a percentage of gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits are not redeemed or recovered breakage 
historically  due to the lack of sufficient historical redemption trend data  we had not recognized breakage on gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we analyzed company specific historical redemption patterns and determined that the likelihood of redemption of unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits three years after their issuance is remote 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adjusted our unearned revenue liability to recognize estimated unredeemed amounts and began to record breakage as additional sales for gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits that remained unredeemed three years after their issuance 
our net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal included a benefit of million to reduce our unearned revenue liability for estimated unredeemed amounts 
our net sales for fiscal included a benefit of million to reduce our unearned revenue liability for estimated unredeemed amounts 
the unearned revenue for gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits is recorded in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at january  and february   respectively 
if actual redemptions ultimately differ from the assumptions underlying our breakage adjustments  or our future experience indicates the likelihood of redemption of gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits becomes remote at a different point in time after issuance  we may recognize further significant adjustments to our accruals for such unearned revenue  which could have a significant effect on our net sales and results of operations 
we maintain a frequent buyer program through our wet seal division 
under the program  customers receive a to discount on all purchases made during a month period and are provided off coupons that may be used on purchases during such period 
the annual membership fee of is nonrefundable 
discounts received by customers on purchases using the frequent buyer program are recognized at the time of such purchases 
we have historically recognized membership fee revenue under the frequent buyer program on a straight line basis over the month membership period due to a lack of sufficient program history to determine customer usage patterns 
during november  we changed from in store delivery to e mail delivery of the program s off coupons  which eliminated the customer s ability to use such coupons at the time of initial purchases 
we believe this change affects customer usage patterns 
we also continue to test alternative program structures  and promotions tied to the program  and may decide to further modify the program in ways that could also affect customer usage patterns 
as a result of the recent program change and potential further modifications  we believe it is appropriate to maintain straight line recognition of membership fee revenue 
we may  in the future  determine that recognition of membership fee revenue on a different basis is appropriate  which would affect net sales 
the unearned revenue for this program is recorded in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at january  and february   respectively 
we maintain a customer loyalty program through our arden b division 
under the program  customers accumulate points based on purchase activity 
once a loyalty program member achieves a certain point level  the member earns awards that may be redeemed for merchandise 
merchandise redemptions are accrued as unearned revenue and recorded as a reduction of net sales as points are accumulated by the member 

table of contents during fiscal  we modified the terms of the arden b loyalty program with respect to the number of points required to earn an award and the value of awards when earned 
at the time of the program change  we also established expiration terms i for prospectively earned awards of two months from the date the award is earned and ii for preexisting awards of either two or months from the program change date 
this resulted in a reduction to our estimate of ultimate award redemptions under the program 
additionally  during fiscal  we further reduced our estimate of ultimate redemptions based upon lower than anticipated redemption levels under the program s revised terms 
as a result  in fiscal  we recorded a benefit of million  which was recorded as an increase to net sales and a decrease to accrued liabilities 
during fiscal  we further modified the terms of the arden b loyalty program whereby  quarterly  we convert into fractional awards the points accumulated by customers who have not made purchases within the preceding months 
similar to all other awards currently being granted under the program  such fractional awards expire if unredeemed after days 
the unearned revenue for this program is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at january  and february   respectively 
if actual redemptions ultimately differ from accrued redemption levels  or if we further modify the terms of the program in a way that affects expected redemption value and levels  we could record adjustments to the unearned revenue accrual  which would affect net sales 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which generally is the merchandise selling price 
cost is calculated using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  inventory is stated at its current retail selling value and then is converted to a cost basis by applying a cost to retail ratio based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity 
the retail inventory method inherently requires management judgments and estimates  such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory  which may impact the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margins 
markdowns are recorded when the sales value of the inventory has diminished 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
when a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise  the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded 
total markdowns on a cost basis in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively  and represented  and of net sales  respectively 
we accrued million and million for planned but unexecuted markdowns as of january  and february   respectively 
to the extent that management s estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may be required that could reduce our gross margin  operating income and the carrying value of inventories 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to anticipate the changing fashion tastes of our customers and to respond to those changing tastes in a timely manner 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changing styles  trends or brand preferences of our customers  we may experience lower sales  excess inventories and more frequent and extensive markdowns  which would adversely affect our operating results 
long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important that could trigger an impairment review include a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses and a projection or 
table of contents forecast that demonstrates continuing losses or insufficient income associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group 
other factors include a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
this evaluation is performed based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows from operating activities compared with the carrying value of the related assets 
if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized  measured by the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets  with such estimated fair values determined using the best information available  generally the discounted estimated future cash flows of the assets using a rate that approximates our weighted average cost of capital 
quarterly  we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
during fiscal  and  we determined such events or changes in circumstances had occurred with respect to certain of our retail stores  and that operating losses or insufficient operating income would likely continue 
as such  we recorded noncash charges of million  million and million  respectively  in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal  and to write down the carrying value of these stores long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
the estimation of future cash flows from operating activities requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth and gross margin performance 
if our sales growth  gross margin performance or other estimated operating results are not achieved at or above our forecasted level  or inflation exceeds our forecast and we are unable to recover such costs through price increases  the carrying value of certain of our retail stores may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill for impairment no less frequently than annually  and also may test on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not impairment may have occurred 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of a reporting unit 
fair value can be determined based on discounted cash flows  comparable sales or valuations of other retail businesses 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the most significant assumptions we use in this analysis are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we use assumptions for items such as comparable store sales  store count growth rates  the rate of inflation and the discount rate we consider to represent our weighted average cost of capital and or the market discount rate for acquisitions of retail businesses 
if our assumptions used in performing the impairment test prove inaccurate  the fair value of our goodwill may ultimately prove to be significantly lower  thereby causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating impairment has occurred 
based on our analysis performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which considered the deteriorating operating performance of the arden b division and our resulting outlook for that business  we wrote off the entire million carrying value of our goodwill  which was directly associated with the arden b division 
this charge is included in asset impairment in our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result  no goodwill remained on our consolidated balance sheets as of january  and february  based on analyses performed in fiscal  we determined that no impairments of goodwill had occurred 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  shared based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 

table of contents we also apply the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in connection with selling  goods and services  and eitf issue no 
 accounting recognition for certain transactions involving equity instruments granted to other than employees for stock based compensation to individuals other than employees 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value stock options granted to employees 
we use these values to recognize stock compensation expense for stock options in accordance with sfas no 
r 
the black scholes model is complex and requires significant exercise of judgment to estimate future common stock dividend yield  common stock expected volatility and the expected life of the stock options 
these assumptions significantly affect our stock option valuations  and future changes in these assumptions could significantly change valuations of future stock option grants and  thus  affect future stock compensation expense 
in addition  if circumstances were to change such that we determined stock options values were better represented by an alternative valuation method  such change could also significantly affect future stock compensation expense 
we also apply the black scholes and monte carlo simulation models to value performance shares granted to employees and consultants 
use of the black scholes model for this purpose requires the same exercise of judgment noted above 
the monte carlo simulation model is also complex and requires significant exercise of judgment to estimate expected returns on our common stock  expected common stock volatility and our maximum expected share value during applicable vesting periods 
this valuation approach also requires us to estimate a marketability discount in consideration of trading restrictions on performance share grants 
we currently believe monte carlo simulation provides the most relevant value of performance share grants as the simulation allows for vesting throughout the vesting period and includes an assumption for equity returns over time  while the black scholes method does not 
as the monte carlo simulation provides a more precise estimate of fair value  we have used that approach to value our performance shares for accounting purposes 
the assumptions we use to value our performance shares significantly affect the resulting values used for accounting purposes 
accordingly  changes in these assumptions could significantly change valuations and  thus  affect future stock compensation expense 
in addition  if circumstances were to change such that we determined performance share values were better represented by the black scholes model or an alternative valuation method  and such changes resulted in a significant change in the value of performance shares  such changes could also significantly affect future stock compensation 
the following table summarizes stock based compensation recorded in the consolidated statements of operations  including charges of million during fiscal associated with performance shares granted to the merchandising consultant as discussed further below under the heading merchandising consultant january  february  february  in thousands cost of sales selling  general  and administrative expenses stock based compensation change in estimated forfeiture rate in the first quarter of fiscal  based on historical analysis  we modified the estimated annual forfeiture rate used in recognizing stock based compensation expense for our executives  which in fiscal had been grouped separately from nonexecutives based on dissimilar historical forfeiture experience  from a forfeiture rate to a forfeiture rate 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as a result of disappointing sales results during the back to school season and our historical operating losses  we concluded during fiscal that it was more likely than not that we would not realize our net deferred tax assets 
as a result of this conclusion  we reduced our net deferred tax assets to zero by establishing a tax valuation allowance in fiscal in addition  we discontinued recognizing income tax benefits in the consolidated statements of operations until we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
as of january   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards nols of million  of which million relates to benefits from the exercise of stock options for which the associated valuation allowance reversal will be recorded to paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheets if and when reversed 
our federal nols begin to expire in the entire federal nol of million is subject to annual utilization limitations as of february  as of january   we also had federal charitable contribution carryforwards of million  which have begun to expire in  alternative minimum tax credits of million  which do not expire  and state nols of million  which begin to expire in and are also subject to annual utilization limitations 
as noted above  we maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets  which are comprised primarily of nols 
through fiscal  we have generated three consecutive fiscal years of federal taxable income and have realized a portion of our nols to offset regular taxable income in those years 
however  as a result of the difficult economic environment in which we currently operate and the impact these economic conditions have had on our comparable store sales trends  especially during the second half of fiscal  we believe that  as of january   evidence continues that does not support realization of these net deferred income tax assets 
prospectively  as we continue to evaluate available evidence  including the depth of the current economic downturn and its implications on our operating results  it is possible that we may deem some or all of our deferred income tax assets to be realizable 
however  this would not change our current expectations that  even if we were to generate taxable income  we would not incur significant cash income tax payments in fiscal as we would continue to utilize available nols 
section of the internal revenue code  or section  contains provisions that may limit the availability of federal nols to be used to offset taxable income in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interests of our common stock 
under section  an ownership change that triggers potential limitations on nols occurs when there has been a greater than change in ownership interest by shareholders owning or more of a company over a period of three years or less 
our current expectations regarding the federal nols we may use annually in fiscal and thereafter are based on calculations made by management in april and december  at which times the company incurred section ownership changes 
if we were to determine that we had incurred another ownership change at some time after december  we would be required to re calculate our annual federal net operating loss utilization limit  which could result in a decrease to nols annually available to offset taxable income 
as a result of these ownership changes  of our million of remaining federal nols  we may utilize up to approximately million of federal nols to offset taxable income in fiscal we may also experience additional ownership changes  as defined by section  in the future which could further limit the amount of federal nols annually available 
we may also generate income in future periods on a federal alternative minimum tax basis  which would result in alternative minimum taxes payable on a portion of such income 
in addition  we may determine that varying state laws with respect to nol utilization may result in lower limits  or an inability to utilize loss carryforwards in some states altogether  which could result in our incurring 
table of contents additional state income taxes 
during fiscal  the state of california passed legislation that suspended our ability to utilize nols to offset taxable income in that state in fiscal and fiscal this resulted in our incurrence of additional state income taxes in california and an increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal to versus our previously expected effective income tax rate of in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions  as defined 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
we were subject to the provisions of fin as of february  the adoption of fin had no effect on our consolidated financial statements 
at january   we had no significant unrecognized tax benefits or expenses that  if recognized  would affect our effective income tax rate in future periods 
we are currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments  accruals or material deviations from our recognized tax positions 
however  if we later identify other income tax issues that result in significant additional payments or necessary accruals  this could have a material adverse effect on our reported results 
insurance reserves we are partially self insured for our workers compensation and group health plans 
under the workers compensation insurance program  we are liable for a deductible of million for each individual claim and an aggregate annual liability of million 
under our group health plan  we are liable for a deductible of million for each claim and an aggregate monthly liability of million 
the monthly aggregate liability is subject to adjustment based on the number of participants in the plan each month 
for both of the insurance plans  we record a liability for the costs associated with reported claims and a projected estimate for unreported claims considering historical experience and industry standards 
we will continue to adjust the estimates as the actual experience dictates 
a significant change in the number or dollar amount of claims could cause us to revise our estimate of potential losses and affect our reported results 
included in accrued liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets as of january  and february   are million and million  respectively  for reported claims and estimated unreported claims under our self insured workers compensation and group health plans 
current trends and outlook we currently operate in a challenging retail environment driven by several factors  including disruptions in the us housing and financial markets  increasing unemployment rates across all regions of the us and significant declines in consumer confidence and spending 
during the fourth calendar quarter of  us gross domestic product decreased on a year over year basis  representing the largest such quarterly decline in the last years 
our operating performance is susceptible to the recent changes in the general economic conditions which have impacted consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending in the united states 
if the conditions remain uncertain or continue to be volatile  our operating performance may be adversely affected 
our comparable store sales decreased for fiscal  driven by a comparable store sales decline in our arden b division as we continued our efforts to position the division with new merchandise  and a comparable store sales decline in our wet seal division 
we made progress on several key initiatives at both divisions during fiscal  including the hiring of a new chief merchandise officer at wet seal and engagement of a consultant to oversee merchandising at arden b  infrastructure down sizing and other organizational changes at arden b  and improved inventory management  better aligned management incentive goals and increased operating efficiencies at both divisions 
while we have made this progress  we will continue to focus on increasing store level efficiencies and lowering operating costs 
we will continue to take aggressive steps to revitalize arden b  including continued maintenance of conservative inventory levels  advancing on our goal of continuing to phase in a better merchandise assortment and modifying pricing and promotional strategies 
table of contents across all product categories in an effort to enhance sales without sacrificing margin performance 
at the same time  we will remain focused on continuing productivity and cost savings initiatives  as well as on several initiatives to improve sales productivity at both divisions 
during the four weeks ended february   we experienced the continuing effects of the difficult retail environment  with a comparable store sales decline of  comprised of an decline in our arden b division and a decline in our wet seal division 
our long term strategy is to return to positive comparable store sales growth  revive the arden b business  expand our existing retail store base and expand our online businesses 
we are also taking several steps to drive higher sales productivity in our retail stores  including improved store layout and visual displays  and have embarked on several initiatives to improve gross margins  including efforts to optimize sourcing of merchandise  enhance our inventory planning and allocation functions  better align merchandise mix with target customer wants and improve supply chain efficiency through better coordination among and within our vendor  internal distribution and store operations organizations 
our operating performance since fiscal has resulted in increased liquidity and improved credit standing with suppliers 
however  we may experience continued declines in comparable store sales or may be unsuccessful in executing some or all of our business strategy 
if our comparable store sales drop significantly for an extended period of time  or we falter in execution of our business strategy  we may not achieve our financial performance goals  which could impact our results of operations and operating cash flow  and we may be forced to seek alternatives to address cash constraints  including seeking debt and or equity financing 
store openings and closures during fiscal  we opened and closed three wet seal stores and closed eight arden b stores 
we believe future closures for at least the next months will primarily result from lease expirations where we decide not to extend  or are unable to extend  a store lease 
we may  however  accelerate the closure of underperforming arden b stores prior to lease expirations in cases where we can obtain favorable early lease terminations with the landlords or may rebrand a limited number of arden b stores as wet seal stores 
we expect to open a small number of new wet seal stores  net of closings  during fiscal credit extensions prior to our recapitalization and financing transactions in fiscal and  we experienced a tight credit environment 
credit extended to us by vendors  factors  and others for merchandise and services was extremely limited 
this credit tightening required us to issue letters of credit outside of the ordinary course of business  or  in many instances  shorten vendor credit terms 
the lack of credit created a considerable need for working capital 
our improving sales trend  the completion of financing transactions in fiscal and and our improved operating results in fiscal through fiscal significantly improved our cash position and liquidity profile 
as a result  we achieved improvements in credit terms with several vendors  and we believe  but cannot provide assurance  that we could now obtain longer credit terms with additional vendors 
however  we continue to maintain shorter credit terms in order to take advantage of favorable purchase discounts 
merchandising consultant from late through the end of fiscal  we used the assistance of a consultant for merchandising initiatives for our wet seal division 
on july   we entered into a related consulting agreement that expired on january   and an associated stock award agreement that expired on january  under the terms of the consulting agreement and stock award agreement  we recorded charges of million in noncash stock compensation  and million in cash charges  within general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during fiscal we incurred no stock compensation or cash charges associated with this agreement during fiscal or fiscal

net sales change from prior fiscal year in millions net sales comparable store sales net sales in fiscal decreased as a result of the following a decrease of in comparable store sales  which resulted from a decrease in the number of transactions per store and a decrease in the average dollar sale per transaction 
the decline in average dollar sale per transaction resulted primarily from a decrease in our average unit retail prices  partially offset by a increase in units purchased per customer  and a decrease of million in net sales for the recording of breakage on unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits  primarily as a result of the fourth quarter of fiscal including a million benefit adjustment  versus no such similar adjustment in fiscal however  these factors were partially offset by an increase of million in net sales for our internet business compared to the prior year  which is not a factor in calculating our comparable store sales  and an increase in the number of stores open  from stores as of february   to stores as of january  
table of contents cost of sales change from prior fiscal year in millions cost of sales percentage of net sales cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise  markdowns  inventory shortages  inventory valuation adjustments  inbound freight  payroll expenses associated with design  buying  planning and allocation  processing  receiving and other warehouse costs  rent  and depreciation and amortization expense associated with our stores and distribution center 
cost of sales decreased due primarily to the decrease in net sales and a decrease in buying  planning and allocation costs due to eliminated positions as a result of the restructuring of the arden b buying and design organization  partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs due to normal inflation in common area maintenance and other costs  the full year effect of occupancy cost for stores opened in fiscal and the partial year effect of occupancy cost for stores opened in fiscal cost of sales increased as a percentage of net sales due primarily to a deleveraging effect on occupancy cost from our comparable store sales decrease 
however  this increase was partially offset by the following decreases an increase in merchandise margin as a percentage of sales 
the merchandise margin increased due to a decrease in markdown rates  as compared to the prior year  and million of preopening costs for our new stores incurred during fiscal  associated with stores under construction and or opened during the period  versus million of such costs incurred in the prior year

general and administrative expenses include the cost of corporate functions such as executives  legal  finance and accounting  information systems  human resources  real estate and construction  loss prevention and other centralized services 
during fiscal  we placed major emphasis on reducing costs across all sg a categories  resulting in a significant decline in sg a in absolute dollars as well as a percentage of sales 
selling expenses decreased approximately million from the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expense was of net sales  or basis points lower  as a percentage of net sales  than that of a year ago 

table of contents the following contributed to the current year decrease in selling expenses an million decrease in payroll and benefits costs as a result of lower sales volume  improved alignment of store incentive programs with sales and labor productivity performance  reduced nonselling store activities  a decrease in claim costs in our employee health care plan  primarily due to an increase in claim costs in the prior year as a result of two unusual cases  and a reduction in store preopening costs  a million decrease in advertising and marketing expenditures due to elimination of print advertising programs in fiscal and the decision not to execute certain advertising activities at our arden b division until merchandise content improves  a million decrease in store supply costs due to improved management oversight and favorable cost negotiations  a million decrease in store and field travel and meeting costs  a million decrease in merchandise delivery costs due to reduced shipping costs as a result of a change in freight carriers  a million decrease in bags and boxes due to lower sales volume  a million decrease in internet production and ordering costs due to reduced shipping costs and improved efficiency in fulfillment  a million decrease in bad debt expenses primarily as a result of decreased credit card chargebacks in our internet operations  a million decrease in stock compensation expense related to forfeitures for terminated employees  a million decrease in inventory service fees  a million decrease in field recruiting and relocation expenses  a million decrease in telephone expenses  and a million net decrease in other selling costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million from the prior year to million 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were  or basis points lower  than a year ago 
the following contributed to the current year decrease in general and administrative expenses a million decrease in corporate wages and payroll taxes primarily due to reduced staffing levels from a january organizational restructuring  a million decrease in board of directors stock compensation expense  a million decrease in consultant fees as a result of a decrease in store lease review fees due to a decline in fiscal store openings  lower internal audit fees as a result of timing of services performed and the prior year including fees for a store efficiency project  a million decrease in recruiting fees  primarily due to fees incurred in the prior year associated with the search for a chief executive officer  a million decrease as a result of prior year charges associated with a separation agreement upon departure of our former chief executive officer  a million decrease in stock compensation primarily due higher than originally estimated forfeitures and a decrease in grants of stock options and other share based awards  
table of contents a million decrease in depreciation due to certain corporate assets becoming fully depreciated in the current year  a million decrease in loss on asset disposals as the prior year included disposals related to software programs  a million decrease in corporate travel  and a million net decrease in other general and administrative expenses 
however  the decreases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by the following increases a million increase in legal fees due to a million prior year insurance reimbursement of previously incurred legal fees  and a general increase in the level of necessary legal services  and a million increase in computer maintenance expense primarily due to additional maintenance fees commencing upon the fiscal acquisition of oracle systems to be implemented in fiscal and fiscal asset impairment change from prior fiscal year in millions asset impairment percentage of net sales based on our quarterly assessments of the carrying value of long lived assets  in fiscal  we identified certain stores  primarily within our arden b division  with carrying values of their assets  including leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment  in excess of such stores respective forecasted undiscounted cash flows 
accordingly  we reduced their respective carrying values to their estimated fair market values and wrote down the value of certain capital additions made to previously impaired stores 
we incurred noncash charges of million in writing down these stores to their respective fair values

total cash and cash equivalents at january   was million  compared to million at february  we maintain a million revolving credit facility  which can be increased up to million in the absence of any default and upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent specified in the agreement 
the revolving credit facility expires in may under our revolving credit facility  we are subject to borrowing base limitations on the amount that can be borrowed and certain customary covenants  including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make investments and acquisitions  grant liens  pay dividends  close stores and dispose of assets  subject to certain exceptions 
our ability to borrow and request the issuance of letters of credit is subject to the requirement that we maintain an excess of the borrowing base over the outstanding credit extensions of not less than million 
the interest rate on our line of credit under the revolving credit facility is the prime rate or  if we elect  the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin ranging from to

we believe we will have sufficient cash and credit availability to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  recently  consumer confidence and consumer spending have deteriorated significantly  and could remain depressed for an extended period 
as a result of this current economic crisis  we may experience continued declines in consolidated comparable store sales or experience other events that negatively affect our operating results 
if our consolidated comparable store sales drop significantly for an extended period  or we falter in execution of our business strategy  including  among other things  the ability of one or more of our vendors to deliver their merchandise in a timely manner or otherwise meet their obligations  we may not achieve our financial performance goals  which could adversely impact our results of operations and operating cash flow 
this could also cause a decrease in or elimination of excess availability under our revolving credit facility  which could force us to seek alternatives to address cash constraints  including seeking additional debt and or equity financing 

table of contents the financial performance of our business is susceptible to the recent declines in discretionary consumer spending  availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in the united states 
volatile fuel prices and increasing commodity costs may also cause a shift in consumer demand away from the retail clothing products that we offer 
there are no guarantees that government initiatives will limit the duration or severity of the current economic recession or stabilize factors that affect our sales and profitability 
recent adverse economic trends could affect us more significantly than companies in other industries 
seasonality and inflation our business is seasonal in nature  with the christmas season  beginning the week of thanksgiving and ending the first saturday after christmas  and the back to school season  beginning the last week of july and ending during september  historically accounting for a large percentage of our sales volume 
for the past three fiscal years  the christmas and back to school seasons together accounted for an average of slightly less than of our annual sales 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the past three years 
however  we cannot be certain that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the cumulative effect  if any  of applying fin is to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit in the year of adoption 
fin also requires that  subsequent to initial adoption  a change in judgment that results in subsequent recognition  derecognition or change in a measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period including any related interest and penalties be recognized as a discrete item in the period in which the change occurs 
fin requires expanded disclosures  including identification of tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next months  a description of tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdiction  a tabular reconciliation of the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning and end of each annual reporting period  the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate and the total amounts of interest and penalties recognized in the statements of operations and financial position 
the adoption of fin had no effect on our consolidated financial statements

provides a new single authoritative definition of fair value and provides enhanced guidance for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and requires additional disclosures related to the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
adoption of sfas no 
was required for companies with fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb issued fsp nos 
and  which partially deferred the effective date of sfas no 
for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  rather  it 
table of contents applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
we adopted sfas no 
effective february   for all financial assets and liabilities as required  however  the adoption of sfas no

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
provides companies with an option to report many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the objective of sfas no 
is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
the fasb believes that sfas no 
helps to mitigate accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities  and would require entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
the new statement does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in sfas no 
as required  we adopted sfas no 
effective february   however  we elected not to apply the fair value option to any of our assets or liabilities

it further requires that research and development assets acquired in a business combination that have no alternative future use be measured at their acquisition date fair value and then immediately charged to expense  and that acquisition related costs are to be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred 
among other changes  this statement also requires that negative goodwill be recognized in earnings as a gain attributable to the acquisition  and any deferred tax benefits resulting from a business combination are recognized in income from continuing operations in the period of the combination 
sfas no 
r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  sfas no

at january   no borrowings were outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
as of january   we are not a party to any material derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we contract for and settle all purchases in us dollars  and in fiscal  we directly imported only approximately of our merchandise inventories 
thus  we consider the effect of currency rate changes to be 
table of contents indirect and we believe the effect of a major shift in currency exchange rates on short term results would be minimal 
over a longer period  the impact of such changes could be significant  albeit indirectly  through increased charges in us dollars from our vendors that source their product internationally
