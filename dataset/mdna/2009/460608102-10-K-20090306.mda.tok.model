overview we are an internet media company that owns  operates and grows branded websites in categories marked by high consumer involvement  strong advertising spending  and significant fragmentation in offline sources of consumer information 
we operate a rapidly growing network of websites  currently grouped into five vertical categories automotive  careers  home  shopping and travel and leisure 
we operated more than principal websites as of december  we also license our content and internet technology products and services to major companies and individual website owners around the world 
we operate our business in two segments consumer internet and licensing 
during the year ended december   we completed website related acquisitions in our consumer internet segment for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we expect to continue to grow our business by acquiring additional websites and improving our existing websites through the application of our operating platform 
our goal is to grow the number  size and profitability of our consumer internet and licensing businesses  and we therefore use certain performance indicators that are key to the elements of our growth strategy in order to manage our business and assess our operational performance online traffic 
a principal element of our strategy in expanding our consumer internet business is expanding the size of the audiences visiting our websites 
thus  we use measures of online traffic to our portfolio of websites  such as page views and monthly unique visitors  as key performance indicators 
consumer internet revenue per view 
increasing monetization of traffic to our websites is a key component of our growth strategy 
we use revenue per view  or rpv  as one measure to evaluate our operational success 
rpv is a measure of the average amount of advertising revenue generated per each page viewed by visitors to our websites 
sales of additional licenses 
for our licensing business  we view the sale of additional licenses and related products  such as website content and user tools  to existing and new customers as a key driver of associated revenue 
acquisitions 
we believe that acquisitions will continue to be an important component of our ability to expand our consumer internet and licensing businesses 
we therefore monitor our acquisitions activity  and our ability to integrate such acquisitions  to assess the success of our growth strategy 
adjusted ebitda 
as discussed in selected consolidated financial data  item we employ adjusted ebitda for several purposes  including as a measure of our operating performance 
we use adjusted ebitda because it removes the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations  thus allowing us to better assess whether the elements of our growth strategy increasing audience sizes  increasing monetization of such audiences  selling additional licenses and related products  and adding and developing new websites are yielding positive results 
we depend on our five vertical consumer website categories for a significant portion of our revenues 
we have continued to diversify the company s revenue streams as evidenced by adding two verticals in shopping and careers which continue to mitigate the risk of downward cycles in any one consumer category 
our revenues we derive our revenues from two segments consumer internet and licensing 
in our consumer internet segment  our revenues are primarily derived from advertisers 
in our licensing segment  our revenues are derived from the licensing of data and technology tools and services to automotive manufacturers and proprietary software for website communities 
our revenues grew from million in to million in the key factors influencing our growth were the addition of websites that we owned  operated and grew  which offered new advertising opportunities to our existing advertisers and facilitated new advertising relationships  increased advertising sales on our websites as our consumer internet audiences grew  increased licensing revenues from our automotive licensing customer base  and increased licensing revenues from jelsoft s vbulletin software 
our revenues in the consumer internet segment increased million  or a increase  during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily a result of a million increase in advertising revenues from our existing and acquired automotive enthusiast  careers  home related  shopping and travel and leisure websites 
partially offsetting this growth and primarily reflecting the continuing weakness in the automotive industry  our cpa and cpl revenues from automotive dealers declined million during fiscal compared to the same period in the prior year 
such reduced advertising spending is consistent with the industry wide downturn in the automotive sector 
this industry has generally been in a downward cycle that began in the second half of and significantly deepened in the second half of we cannot predict how long this negative trend will continue  or when it will end or reverse  our prospects in this area are therefore unpredictable 
during the year ended december  our licensing revenues increased million  or a increase  as a result of the development of new client accounts and the sale of additional services to existing autodata client accounts  and by organic growth from jelsoft s vbulletin software  which was acquired in june historically  our revenues have come from clients located in the united states 
sales denominated in non us currencies accounted for of our revenues in the year ended december   and of our revenues during the year ended december  the sales revenues we currently receive in non us currencies are generally denominated in canadian dollars and british pound sterling 
we receive a small portion of our revenues  which we believe to be an immaterial amount compared to our total revenues  from additional sources outside the united states through credit card and merchant account transactions through the internet 
in these transactions  non us currencies paid are automatically converted to us dollars by credit card companies and other payment intermediaries 
consumer internet revenues our consumer internet segment generates revenues through sales of online advertising in various monetization formats such as cost per lead cpl  cost per thousand impressions cpm  cost per click cpc  cost per action cpa and flat fees 
under the cpl model  our advertiser customers pay for leads generated through our websites and accepted by the customer 
under the cpm format  advertisers pay a fee for displays of their graphical advertisements  typically at an incremental rate per thousand displays or impressions 
under the cpc model  we earn revenues based on click throughs on text based links displayed on our websites  which occur when a user clicks on an advertiser s listing 
we derive revenues on a cpc model through direct sales to advertisers  as well as through various third party advertising networks  such as google  yahoo and tribal fusion  for which we receive a negotiated percentage of their advertising revenues 
under the cpa format  we earn revenues for consumer transactions undertaken through our websites 
we vary our advertising formats based on consumer and advertiser preferences in a particular category and our ability to optimize revenue yields 
for example  we sell display advertising directly to automotive manufacturers and home improvement advertisers on a cpc or cpm basis  and consumer auto and auto finance leads to auto dealers on a cpl basis 
we typically invoice our advertisers for display ads and cpl products on a monthly basis after we have run the ads or delivered the leads 
our contracts with these advertisers are typically on a multiple month basis and are cancelable on days or less notice 
revenue from our shopping sites is typically generated on a cpa basis where we earn commissions as website users buy products online 
we also sell classified listings for annual flat fees to hundreds of vacation rental property owners and managers and bed and breakfast owners 
advertisers typically pay flat fees by credit card  paypal or similar online payment service  utilizing online self serve tools provided on the website 
some of these flat fees are automatically renewed utilizing payment information on file with us 
our policy is not to offer refunds for mid term cancellation of advertisements sold on a flat fee basis 
as consumer and advertiser preferences continue to evolve  we expect that we will adjust our revenue sources and mix on our websites to address those changing needs and optimize our revenue yields 
our advertiser base is highly diversified across our consumer categories 
as of december   we had nearly  advertising customers in our consumer internet segment 
we also utilize a variety of advertising networks and affiliate relationships to monetize our websites 
as our website audiences continue to grow and diversify among our consumer categories  we expect that our sources of advertising revenues also will continue to grow and diversify 
our consumer internet segment revenues represented approximately and of our total revenues in and  respectively 
licensing revenues we license customized products and services and automotive vehicle and marketing data to most major us  japanese and european automotive manufacturers and other online automotive service providers 
customers typically enter into multi year licensing and technology development agreements for these products and services  which include market analytics  product planning  vehicle configuration  management and order placement  in dealership retail systems and consumer facing websites 
with the acquisition of jelsoft  we also sell and license vbulletin internet software to us and international website owners 
vbulletin revenues are primarily derived from software license purchases and leasing for a flat fee  as well as annual maintenance fees for customer support and software updates 
jelsoft received payments from more than  user community websites in our licensing segment revenues represented approximately and of our total revenues in and  respectively 
expenses the largest component of our expenses is personnel 
personnel costs include salaries and benefits for our employees  commissions for our sales staff and stock based compensation  which are categorized in our statements of operations based on each employee s principal function ie sales and marketing  technology or general and administrative 
cost of revenues primarily consists of development costs  including personnel cost  related to the licensing business  marketing costs directly related to the fulfillment of specific customer advertising orders and costs of hosting our websites 
sales and marketing expenses include both personnel and online marketing costs 
general and administrative expenses include personnel  audit  tax and legal fees  insurance and facilities costs 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our revenues are derived from our consumer internet and licensing segments 
consumer internet consumer internet segment revenue is earned from online advertising sales on a cost per impression cpm  cost per click cpc  cost per lead cpl  cost per action cpa or flat fee basis 
we recognize revenue from the display of graphical advertisements delivered on a cpm basis as impressions are delivered 
an impression is delivered when an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users 
advertisements are billed on a flat rate basis and revenue is recognized ratably over the contracted time period  which generally varies from one to twelve months 
a reserve is calculated to accrue for the under delivery of guaranteed minimum impressions and credits 
revenue from the display of text based links to the websites of our advertisers is recognized on a cpc basis  and search advertising is recognized as click throughs occur 
a click through occurs when a user clicks on an advertiser s link 
revenue from advertisers on a cpl basis is recognized in the period the leads are accepted by the dealer or mortgage lender  following the execution of a service agreement and commencement of the services 
service agreements generally have a term of twelve months or less 
new car brokerage revenue and the related auto financing brokerage revenue and after market sales revenue are recognized on a cpa basis 
similar to a sales commission  this brokerage revenue is recognized on a net basis in accordance with emerging issue task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
as contrasted to the gross revenue a car dealership would typically report  we report brokerage revenue on a net basis as we do not bear inventory or credit risk  are not involved in the specification of the product and do not change the product or perform part of the services 
revenue from flat fee  listings based services are based on a customer s subscription to the service for up to twelve months and are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the subscription 
licensing we enter into contractual arrangements with customers to develop customized software and content products  revenue is earned from software licenses  content syndication  maintenance fees and consulting services 
agreements with these customers are typically for multi year periods 
for each arrangement  revenue is recognized when both parties have signed an agreement  the fees to be paid by the customer are fixed or determinable  collection of the fees is probable  delivery of the product has occurred  and no other significant obligations on our part remain 
we do not offer a right of return on these products 
software related revenue is accounted for in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  and interpretations thereof 
post implementation development and enhancement services are not sold separately  the revenue and all related cost of these arrangements are deferred until the commencement of the applicable license period 
revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the license  deferred costs are amortized over the same period as the revenue is recognized 
fees for stand alone projects are fixed bid and determined based on estimated effort and client billing rates since we can reasonably estimate the required effort to complete each project or each milestone within the project 
there are no non software deliverables and the functionality delivered is specific to a customer s previously licensed application 
business combinations we use the purchase method of accounting for business combinations and the results of the acquired businesses are included in the income statement from the date of acquisition 
the purchase price includes the direct costs of the acquisition 
however  beginning in fiscal  acquisition related costs will be expensed as incurred  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb issued revision to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas r 
amounts allocated to intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives  no amounts are allocated to in progress research and development 
goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the net identifiable business assets acquired 
we have entered into earnout agreements which are contingent on the acquired business achieving agreed upon performance milestones 
earnout payments are not based on the seller s on going service to the company  when the seller does provide services following the acquisitions  the cost of the seller s services is recorded as compensation expense in the period the services were performed 
we account for earnout consideration as an addition to goodwill in the period earned 
beginning with fiscal acquisitions  in accordance with sfas r  we will estimate the net present value of expected earnout payments and record such amount as an addition to goodwill and liability or equity  at the time of closing 
subsequent changes of earnout projections are recorded on the statement of operations as other income or expense in the period of remeasurement 
if earnout projections are recorded as equity  then no subsequent remeasurement is required 
goodwill  intangible assets and the impairment of long lived assets we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets 
if circumstances suggest that long lived assets may be impaired  and a review indicates that the carrying value will not be recoverable  as determined based on the projected undiscounted future cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its estimated fair value 
the determination of cash flows is based upon assumptions and forecasts that may not occur 
in addition  we assess goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
the december  consolidated balance sheet includes million of goodwill  million of intangible assets  net  and million of fixed assets  net 
management updated its analysis of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets as of december   and we determined that no impairment had occurred 
we have acquired many companies in each of the last few years and our current business strategy includes continuing to make additional acquisitions in the future 
these acquisitions will continue to give rise to goodwill and other intangible assets which will need to be assessed for impairment from time to time 
provision for income taxes and deferred income tax assets deferred income tax assets and liabilities are periodically computed for temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
significant judgment is necessary in determining valuation allowances necessary for our deferred tax assets 
accounting standards require us to establish a valuation allowance for that portion of our deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that we will not receive a future benefit 
in making this judgment  all available evidence is considered  some of which  particularly estimates of future profitability and income tax rates  are subjective in nature 
estimates of deferred income taxes are based on management s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the consolidated financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and the probability of realization 
actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law  state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the internal revenue service  as well as actual operating results that vary significantly from anticipated results 
our effective income tax benefit rates for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
seasonality the automotive industry in which we provide consumer internet products and services has historically experienced seasonality with relatively stronger sales in the second and third quarters and weaker sales in the fourth quarter 
in  we entered the online shopping category which has historically experienced relatively stronger sales in the fourth quarter

we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  available for sale investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next twelve months 
our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services 
in addition  we intend to make acquisitions  which may require us to raise additional capital through future debt financings or equity offerings to the extent necessary to fund such acquisitions 
on october   we entered into an agreement with silicon valley bank that entitles us to borrow up to a million revolving line of credit under a four year term 
the interest to be paid on the used portion of the credit facility will be based upon libor or the prime rate plus a spread based on the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization

the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies and  in certain cases  is indefinite 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments that we could be obligated to make 
as a result  we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and guarantees in the accompanying balance sheets 
we do  however  accrue for losses for any known contingent liability  including those that may arise from indemnification provisions  when future payment is probable

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued revision to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas r  which establishes the principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business  how it recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and how it determines what information to disclose to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  an entity may not apply this statement before that date 
accordingly  we will adopt sfas r as of january  significant impacts may be realized on any future acquisition s by us as a result of the adoption of sfas r  such as expensing acquisition related costs as incurred and recording the present value of the most probable earnouts for all future years at the time of acquisition as an addition to goodwill 
subsequent changes to the earnout estimates will be recorded as expense or income in the statement of operations in the period of change 
the amount of such impacts cannot be currently determined and will depend on the nature and terms of such acquisition s 
we are currently establishing internal processes to ensure that we address the accounting implications of sfas r for any future acquisitions 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which allows entities to choose  at specified election dates  to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value 
if a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item  changes in that items fair value in subsequent reporting periods must be recognized in current earnings 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  as allowed by the standard  we did not elect the fair value option for the measurement of any eligible assets or liabilities 
therefore  the january  adoption did not have an impact on the company 
in december  the fasb issued sfas non controlling interest in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
this statement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december   with earlier adoption prohibited 
this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
it also amends certain of arb no 
s consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of sfas r 
this statement also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interest of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
we are currently evaluating this new statement and anticipate that the statement will not have a significant impact on the reporting of our results of operation 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 

sfas no 
has the same scope as and is intended to enhance the current disclosure framework of fasb statement no 
fasb statement no 
requires that objectives for using derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of underlying risk and accounting designation 
sfas no 
better conveys the purpose of derivative use in terms of the risk that the entity is intending to manage  disclosing the fair values of the derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format  as well as disclosing information about credit risk related contingent features 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we do not expect implementation of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk we provide our licensing products and services to customers in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
sales are denominated in the respective local currency  primarily in us dollars  and to a lesser but increasing extent  british pound sterling and canadian dollars 
with regard to our foreign currency transactions  we do not use derivative instruments to minimize risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also arises from the net working capital denominated in the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries 
when re measured and translated into us dollars  these net assets may have an impact on our operating results depending upon fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the financial statements of our non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using current exchange rates  with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account  which is a component of stockholders equity 
for the year ended december   the net working capital denominated in the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries was less than of our consolidated net working capital 
for the year ended december   our total realized and unrealized gains due to fluctuations in foreign currencies  primarily canadian dollars and british pound sterling  was less than of our revenue 
as exchange rates fluctuate  these foreign exchange results may vary and adversely or favorably impact our operating results 
however  in light of the above  we believe that an unfavorable fluctuation of in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements 
for the nine months ended september   we recognized foreign exchange gains and losses on the statement of operations for intercompany balances that were denominated in currencies other than the reporting currency 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that intercompany balances between the company and its subsidiaries would not be settled in the foreseeable future  as a result  the foreign exchange gains and losses were recorded as part of the cumulative translation adjustment on the balance sheet 
interest rate risk as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which consisted primarily of cash and us government debt securities with original maturities of days or less from the date of purchase 
we also had marketable securities of million  which consisted primarily of highly liquid asset backed securities and corporate debt securities with original maturities of more than days but less than two years from the date of purchase and are available for use in current operations 
marketable securities that are available for use in current operations are classified as current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets regardless of the remaining time to maturity 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected when interest rates fall 
to minimize this risk  we intend to maintain our portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of instruments  including us government securities  money market funds and high quality debt securities 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
our investment policy limits investments to certain types of securities issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issue
