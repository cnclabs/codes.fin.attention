overview we are a designer and supplier of high performance storage networking  server networking  data networking and converged networking infrastructure solutions 
our solutions are sold worldwide  primarily to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and distributors 
we sell fibre channel and internet small computer systems interface  or iscsi  host bus adapters  infiniband host channel adapters  and fibre channel over ethernet  or fcoe  converged network adapters  which we collectively refer to as host products 
we sell fibre channel switches  including stackable edge  blade and virtualized pass through switches  infiniband switches  including high end multi protocol directors  edge and blade switches  and storage routers for bridging fibre channel and iscsi networks  which we collectively refer to as network products 
we also sell fibre channel controllers  iscsi controllers and converged network controllers  all for select embedded and target applications  which we collectively refer to as silicon products 
our products are incorporated in solutions from a number of oem customers  including cisco systems  inc  dell inc  emc corporation  hewlett packard company  international business machines corporation  netapp  inc  sun microsystems  inc 
and many others 
we use a fifty two fifty three week fiscal year ending on the sunday nearest march fiscal years  and each comprised fifty two weeks and ended on march   march  and april   respectively 
fiscal year and fourth quarter financial highlights and other information during fiscal  our net revenues increased to million from million in fiscal and included increases in each of our host products  network products and silicon products 
net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  in fiscal in addition  the company generated million in cash from operations during fiscal a summary of the key factors and significant events which impacted our financial performance during the fourth quarter of fiscal are as follows net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal was million compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal revenues from host products were million compared to million in the same quarter last year and revenues from network products were million compared to million in the same quarter of fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net revenues of for the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to for the fourth quarter of fiscal operating income as a percentage of net revenues was for the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to in the fourth quarter of fiscal net income was million  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to million  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents cash  cash equivalents and investment securities of million at march  increased from million at march  accounts receivable was million as of march   and decreased from million as of march  days sales outstanding dso in receivables as of march  was days compared to days as of march  inventories were million as of march   compared to million as of march  our annualized inventory turns in the fourth quarter of fiscal were turns compared to turns in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the worldwide economic slowdown  it is extremely difficult for us and our customers to forecast future sales levels based on historical information and trends 
portions of our expenses are fixed and other expenses are tied to expected levels of sales activities 
to the extent that we do not achieve our anticipated level of sales  our gross profit and net income could be adversely affected until such expenses are reduced to an appropriate level 
results of operations net revenues a summary of the components of our net revenues is as follows dollars in millions net revenues host products network products silicon products royalty and service total net revenues percentage of net revenues host products network products silicon products royalty and service total net revenues historically  the global marketplace for network infrastructure solutions has expanded in response to the information storage requirements of enterprise business environments  as well as the market for solutions in high performance computing environments 
these markets have been characterized by rapid advances in technology and related product performance  which has generally resulted in declining average selling prices over time 
in general  our revenues have been favorably affected by increases in units sold as a result of market expansion and the release of new products 
the favorable effect on our revenues as a result of increases in volume has been partially offset by the impact of declining average selling prices 
the united states and other countries around the world have been experiencing deteriorating economic conditions 
this economic decline has resulted in a global downturn in information technology spending rates  which has negatively impacted our revenue and operating results 
in addition  we believe there may be potential for a broader slowdown in global information technology spending rates 
accordingly  it is extremely difficult for us to forecast future sales levels and historical information may not be indicative of future trends 
our net revenues are derived primarily from the sale of host products  network products and silicon products 
net revenues increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily the result of a million  or  increase in revenue from host products  a million  or  increase in revenue from network products  and a million  or  increase in revenue from silicon products 
the increase in revenue from host products was primarily due to an increase in the quantity of host bus adapters sold partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of these products 
the increase in revenue from network products was primarily due to a increase in the number of fibre channel switches sold  partially offset by a decrease in the average selling prices of these products  and a increase in the number of infiniband switches sold  partially offset by an decrease in the average selling prices of these products 
the increase in revenue from silicon products from the prior year was due primarily to a increase in the number of fibre channel and iscsi controllers sold 
net revenues for fiscal included million of royalty and service revenue compared with million of royalty and service 
table of contents revenue for fiscal royalty and service revenues are unpredictable and we do not expect them to be significant to our overall revenues 
net revenues were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily the result of a million  or  increase in revenue from host products and a million  or  increase in revenue from network products  partially offset by a million  or  decrease in revenue from silicon products 
the increase in revenue from host products was primarily due to a increase in the quantity of host bus adapters sold partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of these products 
this host bus adapter volume increase was primarily driven by approximately a increase in the quantity of fibre channel mezzanine cards sold which are used in blade servers and have a lower average selling price than standard host bus adapter products 
the increase in revenue from network products was primarily due to the addition of infiniband switches to our product portfolio as a result of our acquisition of silverstorm technologies  inc silverstorm  partially offset by a decrease in revenue from fibre channel switch products 
the decrease in fibre channel switch revenue was primarily due to a decline in revenue from our legacy and end of life products  which was not offset by revenue from our more recent product offerings until late fiscal the decrease in revenue from silicon products from the same period in the prior year was due primarily to an expected decrease in units sold 
net revenues for fiscal included million of royalty and service revenue compared with million of royalty and service revenue for fiscal a small number of our customers account for a substantial portion of our net revenues  and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
our top ten customers accounted for  and of net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
a summary of our customers  including their manufacturing subcontractors  that represent or more of our net revenues for any of the fiscal years presented is as follows hewlett packard ibm sun microsystems we believe that our major customers continually evaluate whether or not to purchase products from alternative or additional sources 
additionally  customers economic and market conditions frequently change 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that a major customer will not reduce  delay or eliminate its purchases from us 
any such reduction  delay or loss of purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
net revenues by geographic area are as follows in millions united states europe  middle east and africa asia pacific and japan rest of world revenues by geographic area are presented based upon the country of destination  which is not necessarily indicative of the location of the ultimate end user of our products 
no individual country other than the united states represented or more of net revenues for any of the fiscal years presented 
gross profit gross profit represents net revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of purchased products  assembly and test services  costs associated with product procurement  inventory management and product quality  and the amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets 
a summary of our gross profit and related percentage of net revenues is as follows dollars in millions gross profit percentage of net revenues 
table of contents gross profit for fiscal increased million  or  from gross profit for fiscal the gross profit percentage for fiscal was and increased from for the prior year 
the increase in gross profit percentage was primarily the result of manufacturing related efficiencies and a decline of million in amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets in fiscal gross profit for fiscal decreased million from gross profit for fiscal the gross profit percentage for fiscal was and decreased from for the prior year 
the decline in gross profit percentage was primarily impacted by a shift in product mix  including the addition of infiniband products as a result of our acquisition of silverstorm  and an increase of million in amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets 
our ability to maintain our current gross profit percentage can be significantly affected by factors such as the results of our investment in engineering and development activities  supply costs  the worldwide semiconductor foundry capacity  the mix of products shipped  the transition to new products  competitive price pressures  the timeliness of volume shipments of new products  the level of royalties received  our ability to achieve manufacturing cost reductions  and amortization and impairments of purchased intangible assets 
we anticipate that it will be increasingly difficult to reduce manufacturing costs 
as a result of these and other factors  it may be difficult to maintain our gross profit percentage consistent with historical periods and it may decline in the future 
operating expenses our operating expenses are summarized in the following table dollars in millions operating expenses engineering and development sales and marketing general and administrative special charges purchased in process research and development total operating expenses percentage of net revenues engineering and development sales and marketing general and administrative special charges purchased in process research and development total operating expenses engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefit costs  service and material costs  occupancy costs and related computer support costs 
during fiscal  engineering and development expenses decreased to million from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in acquisition related stock based compensation that resulted from headcount reductions in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a million decrease in cash compensation and benefit costs and a million decrease in occupancy and related computer support costs that both resulted from a net reduction in headcount  including a reduction in headcount related to the consolidation and elimination of certain engineering activities during fiscal these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in depreciation and equipment costs 
during fiscal  engineering and development expenses decreased to million from million in fiscal the decrease in engineering and development expenses was due primarily to a decrease in acquisition related stock based compensation of million  a million decrease in new product development costs and a million decrease in cash compensation and related benefit costs 
these decreases resulted primarily from the consolidation and elimination of certain engineering activities 
see further discussion under special charges 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in stock based compensation  excluding acquisition related charges  a million increase in occupancy costs and related computer support costs  and a million increase in depreciation and equipment costs 
we believe continued investments in engineering and development activities are critical to achieving future design wins  expansion of our customer base and revenue growth opportunities 

table of contents sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefit costs  sales commissions  promotional activities and travel for sales and marketing personnel 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses was due primarily to a million increase in salaries due to increased average headcount during fiscal  a million increase in occupancy costs and related computer support costs and a million increase in commissions 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in promotional costs  including our costs for certain sales and marketing programs  and a million decrease in travel costs  both related to our cost cutting measures in the second half of fiscal sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was due primarily to a million decrease in promotional costs  including the costs for certain sales and marketing programs  and a decrease in stock based compensation of million  including stock based compensation related to acquisitions  partially offset by a million increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets related to the acquisition of silverstorm  an increase in depreciation and equipment costs of million  a million increase in cash compensation and related benefit costs and a million increase in travel related expenses 
we believe continued investments in our sales and marketing organizational infrastructure and related marketing programs are critical to the success of our strategy of expanding our customer base and enhancing relationships with our existing customers 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefit costs for executive  finance  accounting  human resources  legal and information technology personnel 
non compensation components of general and administrative expenses include accounting  legal and other professional fees  facilities expenses and other corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to a million decrease in stock based compensation  partially offset by a million increase in cash compensation and related benefit costs due to increased headcount 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to a million increase in cash compensation and related benefit costs  a million increase in accounting and legal fees  and a million increase in bad debt expense 
special charges 
during fiscal  we implemented a workforce reduction initiative  primarily in response to the macroeconomic environment  and recorded special charges totaling million 
the special charges consisted primarily of million of exit costs associated with severance benefits for the affected employees and costs related to a facility under a non cancelable lease that we vacated during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded special charges totaling million related to workforce reductions and the consolidation and elimination of certain activities  principally related to certain engineering functions 
the special charges consisted of million for exit costs and million for asset impairments 
the exit costs include the costs associated with workforce reductions  the cancellation of a contract and the consolidation of certain facilities 
the unpaid exit costs as of march   which aggregate million  are expected to be paid over the terms of the related agreements  principally during fiscal purchased in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisitions  we recorded million of purchased in process research and development ipr d charges during fiscal the amounts allocated to ipr d were determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed 
the fair value of the ipr d for each of the acquisitions was determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  the expected future cash flows from each project under development are estimated and discounted to their net present values at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return are the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets  as well as the risks inherent in the development process  including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance 
each project was analyzed to determine the unique technological innovations  the existence and reliance on core technology  the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the complexity  cost and time to complete the remaining development 
future cash flows for each project were estimated based on forecasted revenue and costs  taking into account product life cycles  and market penetration and growth rates 
as of march   all ipr d projects were complete 

table of contents interest and other income  net components of our interest and other income  net  are as follows in millions interest income impairment of investment securities gain on sales of available for sale securities loss on sales of available for sale securities gain on sale of shares of a publicly traded company gain related to put options loss on trading securities other interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to a decrease in the balance of our investment securities and a decline in interest rates 
the impairment charges on investment securities of million  includes million related to declines in value of our available for sale securities that were deemed to be other than temporary and million related to our investments in a money market fund and an enhanced cash fund sponsored by the reserve an asset management company 
during fiscal  we sold all of our remaining holdings in common stock that we held in a publicly traded company and recorded a net gain of million 
we had received the common stock in connection with the sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business in fiscal we had previously recorded impairment charges related to these shares totaling million since fiscal  including million during fiscal the gain related to put options includes million recognized as a result of an agreement that we entered into with the broker for substantially all of our auction rate securities ars that entitles us to sell the related ars back to the broker for a price equal to the liquidation preference of the ars plus accrued but unpaid dividends or interest  if any  at any time between june  and july   if the securities are not earlier redeemed or sold 
in addition  we recorded a million gain related to subsequent increases in the fair value of these put options during fiscal the loss on trading securities was due to the realization of million of previously unrealized losses on certain ars that were transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as a result of the reclassification of the ars from available for sale to trading securities and million related to changes in the fair value of these trading securities subsequent to the reclassification 
interest and other income  net  for fiscal of million was comprised principally of interest income of million related to our portfolio of investment securities and million of net realized gains on sales of available for sale securities  partially offset by a million impairment charge on available for sale securities 
interest income decreased primarily due to a decrease in the balance of our investment securities and a decline in interest rates 
we reviewed various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge related to our unrealized losses in available for sale securities  including the current financial and credit market environment  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the investment security  the magnitude of the unrealized loss compared to the cost of the investment  the length of time the investment has been in a loss position and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of market value 
based on this analysis  we determined that a portion of the unrealized losses were other than temporary and recorded impairment charges of million  million and million related to our portfolio of available for sale securities during fiscal  and  respectively 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  our effective income tax rate was adversely impacted by additional payments in connection with an intercompany technology license related to our intellectual property  which resulted in additional income taxed at us rates  and a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets related to impairment charges on certain investment securities 
the impact of these items was partially offset by the resolution of routine tax examinations and higher income generated from our foreign operations  which are taxed at more favorable rates 
given the 
table of contents increased global scope of our operations  and the complexity of global tax and transfer pricing rules and regulations  it has become increasingly difficult to estimate earnings within each tax jurisdiction 
if actual earnings within each tax jurisdiction differ materially from our estimates  we may not achieve our expected effective tax rate 
additionally  our effective tax rate may be impacted by other items including the tax effects of acquisitions  newly enacted tax legislation  stock based compensation and uncertain tax positions 
as of april   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our combined balances of cash  cash equivalents and investment securities increased to million at march   from million at march  we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  investment securities and expected cash flow from operations will provide sufficient funds to finance our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need to supplement our existing sources of liquidity to finance our activities beyond the next twelve months or for the future acquisition of businesses  products or technologies and there can be no assurance that sources of liquidity will be available to us at that time 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal and million for fiscal operating cash flow for fiscal reflects our net income of million  net non cash charges of million and a net decrease in the non cash components of working capital of million 
the decrease in the non cash components of working capital was primarily due to a million decrease in accounts receivable and a million increase in accrued taxes  partially offset by million increase in inventories 
the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to the decline in revenue during the fiscal fourth quarter compared to the corresponding period in fiscal and the increase in accrued taxes was mainly due to the timing of payment obligations 
the increase in inventories was primarily due to an increase as a result of a planned contract manufacturer transition 
cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal and consisted of distributions totaling million related to our investments in a money market fund and enhanced cash fund sponsored by the reserve an asset management company and net sales and maturities of investment securities of million  partially offset by a million reclassification of certain cash equivalents to investment securities related to our investments in the funds sponsored by the reserve and purchases of property and equipment of million 
cash provided by investing activities for fiscal was million and consisted primarily of net sales and maturities of investment securities of million  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of million 
as our business grows  we expect capital expenditures to increase in the future as we continue to invest in machinery and equipment  more costly engineering and production tools for new technologies  and enhancements to our corporate information technology infrastructure 
cash used in financing activities of million for fiscal consisted primarily of our purchase of million of common stock under our stock repurchase programs  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans and the related tax benefit 
cash used in financing activities for fiscal of million resulted from our purchase of million of common stock under our stock repurchase programs  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans and the related tax benefit 
our investment securities include million of investments in ars  the majority of which are rated aa or higher 
during late fiscal  the market auctions of many ars began to fail  including auctions for our ars 
the underlying assets for auction rate debt securities in our portfolio are student loans  substantially all of which are backed by the federal government under the federal family education loan program 
the underlying assets of our auction rate preferred securities are the respective funds investment portfolios 
in november  we entered into an agreement with the broker for substantially all of the ars we currently hold  which provides us with certain rights ars rights  in exchange for the release of potential claims and damages against the broker 
the ars rights entitle us to sell the related ars back to the broker for a price equal to the liquidation preference of the ars plus accrued but unpaid dividends or interest  if any  which price is referred to as par 
the ars rights may be exercised by us at any time between 
table of contents june  and july   if the securities are not earlier redeemed or sold 
under the ars rights  the broker may  at its discretion  purchase the ars at any time through july  without prior notice to us and must pay us par value for the ars within one day of the sale transaction settlement 
while we expect to ultimately recover our investments in the ars at par  we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our ars should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities prior to redemption by the issuer or the exercise of the ars rights 
there is also a risk that our broker will default on its obligation to purchase the ars in the event that we exercise the ars rights 
except for our ars and the related put options  our investment securities are valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market inputs 
as of march   the entire million portfolio of ars and the related put options valued at million collectively of our investment securities portfolio were measured at fair value based on an income approach using an estimate of future cash flows 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model included estimates for the amount and timing of future interest and principal payments  the collateralization of underlying security investments  the creditworthiness of the issuer and the rate of return required by investors to own these securities in the current environment  including call and liquidity premiums 
since fiscal  we have had various stock repurchase programs that authorized the purchase of up to billion of our outstanding common stock  including a program approved in november authorizing the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
during fiscal  we purchased million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million  of which million was pending settlement at march  and is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
during fiscal  we purchased million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million  of which million was pending settlement and is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
pursuant to the existing stock repurchase programs  we are authorized to repurchase shares with an aggregate cost of up to million as of march  on april   we acquired netxen  inc netxen in a merger transaction 
netxen develops  markets and sells ethernet adapter and controller products targeted at the enterprise server market 
the acquisition provides us with complementary networking products and intellectual property 
the acquisition further expands our expertise in strategic areas of technology and enables us to better address a wider range of emerging customer requirements for converged networks 
consideration paid for this acquisition was approximately million in cash  subject to certain closing adjustments 
we have certain contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments in the form of non cancelable purchase orders to our suppliers and commitments under operating lease arrangements 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of march   and their impact on our cash flows in future fiscal years  is as follows thereafter total in millions operating leases non cancelable purchase obligations total the amount of unrecognized tax benefits under fin  including related accrued interest and penalties  at march  was million 
we are not able to provide a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax payments related to these obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors  including the current economic environment  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the accounting policies described below to be our most critical accounting policies 
these accounting policies are affected significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order or a signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery occurs when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  in accordance with the terms specified in the arrangement with the customer 
the customer s obligation to pay and the payment terms are set at the time of delivery and are not dependent on the subsequent resale of our product 
however  certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements which contain a limited right to return unsold product and price protection provisions 
we recognize revenue from these distributors based on the sell through method using inventory information provided by the distributor 
at times  we provide standard incentive programs to our customers and account for such programs in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
accordingly  we account for our competitive pricing incentives  which generally reflect front end price adjustments  as a reduction of revenue at the time of sale  and rebates as a reduction of revenue in the period the related revenue is recorded based on the specific program criteria and historical experience 
in addition  we record provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated product returns in the same period that revenue is recognized 
these provisions are based on historical experience as well as specifically identified product returns 
royalty and service revenue is recognized when earned and receipt is reasonably assured 
for those sales that include multiple deliverables  we allocate revenue based on the relative fair values of the individual components as determined in accordance with eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
when more than one element  such as hardware and services  are contained in a single arrangement  we allocate revenue between the elements based on each element s relative fair value  provided that each element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in the absence of fair value for a delivered element  we allocate revenue first to the fair value of the undelivered elements and allocate the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
in the absence of fair value for an undelivered element  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  resulting in a deferral of revenue recognition for the delivered elements 
such deferred revenue is recognized over the service period or when all elements have been delivered 
we sell certain software products and related post contract customer support pcs  and account for these transactions in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
we recognize revenue from software products when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is probable 
revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the element 
vsoe of the fair value is based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
if we are unable to determine vsoe of fair value for an undelivered element  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the service period or when all elements have been delivered 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this reserve is determined by analyzing specific customer accounts  applying estimated loss rates to the aging of remaining accounts receivable balances  and considering the impact of the current economic environment where appropriate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to pay their accounts when due  additional reserves might be required 
stock based compensation statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and non employee directors including stock options  restricted stock units and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan the espp based on estimated fair values on the date of grant 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period for stock options and restricted stock units  and the offering period for the espp 
the determination of fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant 
table of contents using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
in estimating expected stock price volatility  we use a combination of both historical volatility  calculated based on the daily closing prices of our common stock over a period equal to the expected term of the option  and implied volatility  utilizing market data of actively traded options on our common stock 
we believe that the historical volatility of the price of our common stock over the expected term of the option is a strong indicator of the expected future volatility 
we also believe that implied volatility takes into consideration market expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility 
accordingly  we believe a combination of both historical and implied volatility provides the best estimate of the future volatility of the market price of our common stock 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
however  our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of their fair value 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin  income tax positions should be recognized in the first reporting period that the tax position meets the recognition threshold 
previously recognized income tax positions that fail to meet the recognition threshold in a subsequent period should be derecognized in that period 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to complex tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
differences between actual results and our assumptions  or changes in our assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences using enacted statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
temporary differences include the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
an adjustment to income would occur if we determine that we are able to realize a different amount of our deferred tax assets than currently expected 
investment securities our investment securities include available for sale securities  trading securities and other investment securities and are classified in the consolidated balance sheets based on the nature of the security and the availability for use in current operations 
our available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  based on quoted market prices or other observable inputs 
unrealized gains and losses  net of related income taxes  on our portfolio of available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income until realized 
our trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses included in earnings and reported in interest and other income  net 
in the absence of quoted market prices for trading securities  we value these securities based on an income approach using an estimate of future cash flows 
our other investment securities are primarily accounted for under the cost method and recorded at the lower of fair value or cost 
we recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of an investment below its cost basis is judged to be other than temporary 
significant judgment is required in determining the fair value of investment securities in inactive markets as well as determining when declines in fair value constitute an other than temporary impairment 
we consider various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge  including the current financial and credit market environment  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the security  the magnitude of the loss compared to the cost of the investment  the length of time 
table of contents the investment has been in a loss position and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of market value 
realized gains or losses and other than temporary declines in the fair value of investment securities are determined on a specific identification basis and reported in interest and other income  net  as incurred 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we write down the carrying value of our inventory to estimated net realizable value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
these assumptions are based on economic conditions and trends both current and projected  anticipated customer demand and acceptance of our current products  expected future products and other assumptions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
once we write down the carrying value of inventory  a new cost basis is established 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in an increase in the newly established cost basis 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets acquired  other than goodwill  impact the amount and timing of future amortization  and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired  by comparing the carrying value to the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned 
a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill 
we perform the annual test for impairment as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter and utilize the two step process 
the initial recording and subsequent evaluation for impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets requires the use of significant management judgment regarding the forecasts of future operating results 
it is possible that our business plans may change and our estimates used may prove to be inaccurate 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than current estimates used  we could incur impairment charges 
long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment and purchased intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
significant judgment is required in determining whether a potential indicator of impairment of our long lived assets exists and in estimating future cash flows for any necessary impairment tests 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
estimating future net cash flows and determining proper asset groupings for the purpose of this impairment test requires the use of significant management judgment 
if our actual results  or estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than our current estimates  we could incur impairment charges

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of march   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value 
we maintain a portfolio of investment securities consisting primarily of debt securities  including government and agency securities  corporate debt obligations  asset and mortgage backed securities  and municipal bonds  which principally have remaining terms of three years or less 
we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates as movements in interest rates can result in changes in the market value of our investments in debt securities 
however  due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio we do not believe that we are subject to material interest rate risk 
in accordance with our investment guidelines  we only invest in instruments with high credit quality standards and we limit our exposure to any one issuer or type of investment 
our portfolio includes million of investment securities that are classified as available for sale 
our asset and mortgage backed securities totaled million as of march  and consisted primarily of high quality investments insured by the federal government under various programs 
as of march   we had gross unrealized losses associated with our available for sale securities of million that were determined by management to be temporary in nature 
if the credit market continues to deteriorate  we may conclude that the decline in value is other than temporary and incur realized losses  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
our portfolio of investment securities as of march  also includes million of investments in auction rate debt and preferred securities ars  the majority of which are rated aa or higher  and related put options valued at million 
substantially all of these investment securities are accounted for as trading securities 
there is currently significant turmoil in the credit market  including the impact to the value and liquidity of ars 
as of march   our investment portfolio includes million of auction rate debt securities and million of auction rate preferred securities 
during late fiscal  the market auctions of many ars began to fail  including auctions for our ars 
the underlying assets for auction rate debt securities in our portfolio are student loans  substantially all of which are backed by the federal government under the federal family education loan program 
the underlying assets of our auction rate preferred securities are the respective funds investment portfolios 
in november  we entered into an agreement with the broker for substantially all of the ars we currently hold  which provides us with certain rights ars rights  in exchange for the release of potential claims and damages against the broker 
the ars rights entitle us to sell the related ars back to the broker for a price equal to the liquidation preference of the ars plus accrued but unpaid dividends or interest  if any  which price is referred to as par 
the ars rights may be exercised by us at any time between june  and july   if the securities are not earlier redeemed or sold 
under the ars rights  the broker may  at its discretion  purchase the ars at any time through july  without prior notice to us and must pay us par value for the ars within one day of the sale transaction settlement 
while we expect to ultimately recover our investments in the ars at par  we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our ars should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities prior to redemption by the issuer or the exercise of the ars rights 
there is also a risk that our broker will default on its obligation to purchase the ars in the event that we exercise the ars rights 
in addition  our investment securities as of march   include an aggregate of million in a money market fund and enhanced cash fund sponsored by the reserve an asset management company that suspended trading and redemptions in september these funds are in the process of being liquidated and we expect the liquidation to occur in stages with proceeds distributed as the underlying securities mature or are sold 
in february  the reserve announced a plan for liquidation and distribution of assets of the money market fund that includes the establishment of a special reserve which will be used to satisfy pending or threatened claims against the fund  its officers and trustees  and anticipated costs and expenses  including legal and accounting fees 
the reserve plans to continue to make periodic distributions  up to the amount of the special reserve  on a pro rata basis 
during fiscal  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges aggregating million related to our investments in the funds sponsored by the reserve 
based on our existing cash  cash equivalents and other investment securities  as well as our expected cash flows from operating activities  we do not anticipate that the potential lack of liquidity of these investments in the near term will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
we do not use derivative financial instruments
